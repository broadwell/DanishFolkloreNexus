A farm in Hallund that was called Lunden caught fire once. As soon as they discovered the fire, they sent for pastor Jermiin from Øster-Brønderslev, who also arrived before it had burned too much. Everyone knew that he could put fire out with words, but there was one person there who doubted that, that was Kristen Hansen from Hellum and he said, "It won't help, pastor, the fire can't be put out." -- "What are you saying, man?" said the minister, and the fire went out immediately.
