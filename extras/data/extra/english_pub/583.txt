A mound man lived once in Stovbak and he was going to move with his entire family since he couldn’t live there because of all the dingdangers. He went down to Anders Kusk to borrow a pair of oxen, but he didn’t really think much of saying yes, but he didn’t dare say no. The mound man got them but the next morning they lay and were dead, and in front of each lay a measure of money to pay for them.
