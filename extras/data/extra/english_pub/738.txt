Merfolk certainly exist. In 1826, when the sea broke in, it had been such incredibly beautiful weather the day before. It was the day that they were supposed to get their Christmas dinner and so the fishermen had gone out and had really started to fish. Then there was one fisherman who was a little ways away from the others fishing. Then a mermaid comes up right next to his boat, and she pulls a sock off one foot and puts it on the other, and it looked so sad, she only had one sock, and she was switching it quickly from one foot to the other. But then he pulls a sock off one of his legs--he had under socks on--and throws it to the mermaid. She snags it and goes under the water again. After she'd been down for a quarter of an hour or so, then she comes up right next to his boat: "Listen man who gave me the sock, you should hurry ashore, otherwise you'll wind up eating your Christmas dinner here tonight." Then he and his buddies hurried to get ashore, and just as soon as they had come ashore, the mermaid raised so huge a storm that everyone who was at sea drowned. But the man and his men were saved. That was the day the sea broke in.
