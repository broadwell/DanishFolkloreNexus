A minister who was very poor once lived here in Glenstrup. His wife had complained for a long time that they had too little milk, they had a hard time getting butter and other such things. But then one day the minister comes out into the farm and his daughter is sitting by an alder tree and is milking milk out of the alder. Naturally, the minister’s wife was a witch, and she had sent her out to milk, but the minister knew nothing about this. The minister came from the field and saw this. “What’s that you’re sitting and doing here, my girl?” he says, “Who asked you to do this?” Her mother had, but now the cow couldn’t give any more milk, because now there came blood. Yes, she should continue as long as something came, if it was either blood or milk. Then she continued and then the cow died. It was supposedly a farmer’s cow here in the town. He gets so upset about it, that he lost his health and died a little later. The alder tree stands in the parsonage even now, it stands a little apart in the western corner of the cabbage patch.
