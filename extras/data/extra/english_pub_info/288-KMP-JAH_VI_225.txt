There were two brothers in Hadbjærg. One of them was to go out and hitch up the cows and then water them at a water hole. But they got mad and started to run off. Then he ran home to his brother and said, “You need to come out and help me with the cows, because I’ve hung the bad one onto the worst one, and now there still lying in the shit and they’ve run off.” That guy was a bit foolish.
