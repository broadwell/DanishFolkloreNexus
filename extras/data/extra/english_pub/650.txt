One evening, a group of farmhands were gathered in Lyndelse Inn on Fyn. They were enjoying themselves playing cards. As they were sitting there, someone came in and started playing with them.  After they had played for a while, they got into a fight. In his excitement, the dealer dropped some cards on the floor. He wanted to bend down to pick them up, but now he saw that the foreigner had a shaggy leg with a horse's hoof on the end, so he was the Devil himself. They sent someone to get the Stenl√∏se minister with the request that he come and drive him out. The minister came. He poked a hole in the window with a pin and he drove the Devil out of the inn through that hole.
