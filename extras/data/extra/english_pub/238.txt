There was a farmhand who rode past a mound which they called Henningshøj, it lies south of Hornslet. There he saw so many little people and they were dancing and hopping outside of the mound. So he stopped and wanted to watch what was going on and then one came over and offered him a gold [drinking] horn and invited him to drink it up. He took it but threw it back behind him. Three drops landed on the back of the horse and it took both its hair and skin off. Now he rode as fast as he could and the little people came after him with the hag in the front. Then he could see that he couldn't hold his own with her, so he set off across the plowed field. She couldn't run over that, she had to run around each furrow, and then she yelled out to him and said: “You should ride on the unplowed fields (boor) and not on the plowed fields (joor)” and at the same time she took a clump of dirt and threw it at him. That became a mound on the field which they call Vendingshøj [Turning mound], since she turned around at the same time, she could see that she could neither catch him nor hit him. It has later been changed to Hæningshøj. Since he'd gotten away from her so luckily, he used the drinking horn to build Horns church, and it got its name from that.
