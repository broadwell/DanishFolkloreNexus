The Jerusalem's Cobbler can only rest one time a year, and then on a plow, if he can find one to sit on Christmas Eve. At the other times of the year, he can't rest, and that's why people have tended to take their plows in before Christmas, because they didn't want him sitting on them. Some have claimed to have seen him that night and his clothes were made of green moss.
