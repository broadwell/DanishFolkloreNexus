There was a man out in Gandrup who occupied himself with bewitching people. Then his own people figured out to hang a horse’s head up in the smoke in their own chimney, as long as it hung there, he got no peace or quiet, except when he lay with a rye bread on his chest. He lay in his bed for several years and held on to that rye bread. Then the Devil couldn’t come and squeeze him.
