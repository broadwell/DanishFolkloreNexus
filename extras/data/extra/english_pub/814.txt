Lange-Margrete was a gypsy and killed pregnant women and ate the hearts of the children, since she believed that once one had managed to eat seven you could become invisible. But she only managed to get six. Then she was caught and put down in a cellar hole under the west wing of N. Vosborg’s main building and later decapitated. That hole is called Lange-Margrete’s hole to this very day.
