Those who go to the Black School run out of it when they are done since the one who comes out last belongs to the Devil. There was once a minister who came out last but he was wise enough to tell the Devil that he could take his shadow first and had to be happy with that. The minister didnâ€™t have a shadow after that, and the Devil often put it on and went around with it, so people thought that they saw the minister out in the field and other places, even though he was at home in his house at the same time.
