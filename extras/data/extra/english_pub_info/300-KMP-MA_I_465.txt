Once Uglspil wanted to go and have his boots blocked at a cobblers. When he got there he said, “here are my boots, I’d like them patched and it should be done well.” Yes, the cobbler thought that it could be done, because he could guess what it was. When Uglspil had left, the journeyman asks the master if he couldn’t patch them for him. Sure he could. Then he got some bacon and put one piece after the other into the boots. Then Uglspil came back to get them and asked how much it cost. Yes, so and so much. The cobbler got what he asked for, and he was quite pleased and Uglspil thanked them and left. The master and the journeyman now went over to a window and watched him and they laughed and giggled and they thought they’d really got him good. Uglspil noticed it but when he’d gone a ways and they’d moved away from the window he went back and stuck his head in through a window pane and shouted: “Could you tell me if it was female or male pig bacon you used to stuff my boots?” None of them could pull themselves together to answer him and so he went to the next window with the same question and he continued like that smashing each of the window panes. Finally they answered him, “sow bacon!” and then he left. Then the master turned to the journeyman and said: “What do you say to that? Can you pay for the windows now?”
