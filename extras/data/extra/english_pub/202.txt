There was a robber who lived in a mound south west of Ugilt church. It's on the parsonage’s field and is still called Daniel’s mound, because the robber was called Daniel. He took people up and took their money and killed them, and he was supposed to have killed several hundred like that. This robber had gotten so strong because he’d eaten two children’s hearts, and if he’d eaten the third, then he would have been able to break iron and everything. But then they got a lot of people together and they overwhelmed him eventually and caught him, before he’d eaten the third heart. He’d actually put it in his mouth. Then they tried him very quickly and killed him immediately after.
