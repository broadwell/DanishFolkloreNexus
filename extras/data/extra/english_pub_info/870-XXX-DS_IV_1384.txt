One time, a wealthy lord came and stayed at an inn, and the innkeepers saw that he had a lot of money in his wallet.  They couldn't bear to see that, so they got up at night and sliced him to death.Then there was a little child who went and sang, "My father and my mother have slaughtered a magnificent lord tonight, now we will have roast to eat, and sausages for lunch." The wife said to her husband, "That child will do us harm, you better go down and drown her." Then the child sang: "I will go to school and not demand any bread," and now he couldn't drown her. Well, then they lit the fire in the oven so they could burn her. At that moment, two horse dealers came into the inn and then the child goes over and complains to them and says, "My father wants to drown me, and my mother to burn me, won't you take me with you?" They answer: "That's just childish nonsense," since they couldn't believe that they intended to do that, since she was their only child. Then when they came down to a stream that they had to cross, they couldn't get the horses across no matter what they tried. "Let's ride up there again," they say, "maybe the child can tell us what to do." When they got up to the inn, the people had shut the doors tight, and they had to knock loudly on it. Would they give them a glass of beer? Well, the wife said she didn't have time right now, but they continued to push, it was a public inn and they wanted to come in. Then she had to open up, and there the child lay and was all burned up, and her mouth was quite black. That the innkeepers came to regret that you can pretty much imagine.
