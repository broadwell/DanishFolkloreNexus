There’s a corpse lamb over at Dover church, it goes about on three legs. When the church was built, they were supposed to bury a living creature under the foundation. They were so poor that they couldn’t get a hold of anything other than a lamb, at other places there was usually a sow, a horse or a cow. The old church was actually in Illerup, but it had become so dilapidated, that it couldn’t stay up and then they were going to build a new one. The people wanted it built in Svejstrup, it wasn’t in one end of the parish, and the parsonage and school were there too. But everything they built wouldn’t stay together and they couldn’t get a church there. So they didn’t know what to do. Then one day a traveler came by and while they stood there and hammered on the walls, he said, “What have you got here, little people, this looks like it's falling apart to me.” – “Well, we want to build a church here, but we can’t get it to stand; it falls down for us.” – “Well,” he says, “you shouldn’t do it like this, you should get two oxen, which have never been in a harness before, and put a pulling harness on them, and then harness them to a pair of wheels, and let them go after sunset.” Then the oxen wandered so far during the night that they came over to where Dover church now stands; there was a big swamp, and they went out into that and they couldn’t get out. And so that’s where the church was built. The corpse lamp has been seen by a few, and Smede-Rask has seen it, and also my great grandfather; he believed that that is what it was.
