The parish clerk in Mjessing, he was supposed to ring (the church bells), and after the first ringing there was a pause. The parish clerk uses this opportunity to eat his lunch in the weapon house. The church chickens knew this because he often tossed them a few crumbs. Then one day the minister discovers him during his meal and he wants to chase the chickens out, but they donâ€™t want to leave and he takes off his hat and waves it about among them and is so unlucky that he hits the rooster and knocks it unconscious. So he puts in his pocket under his long gown. He goes in and the minister is up at the pulpit and he begins to sleep. Then the rooster wakes up, creeps out, flies up to the altar and crows. The parish clerk wakes up and sings Amen.
