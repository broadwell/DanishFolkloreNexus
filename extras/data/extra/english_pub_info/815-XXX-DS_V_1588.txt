Many years ago, there was a foreman at Bramstrup, a mile from Odense, who was called Maes or Markus Kalv, and he ran the farm for an old widow who at that time was the owner of it. That foreman was a horrible tyrant toward the lease holders, he always went out to harass and punish them and confiscate their possessions. There is a forest that at the time belonged to the peasants in Volderslev, and it was called Lunden, and it bordered on Langholm, a forest that belonged to Bramstrup. Markus Kalv couldn't bear that the peasants should keep this forest, and he tried to steal it from them unjustly. He took dirt from the farm's field and put it in his boots, etc. and then swore to the holy trinity that the earth on which he stood as well as the branches that hung over his head belonged to the lady at Bramstrup. When he'd done this, he went home to the lady at Bramstrup and said, "Lund and Langholm are now yours." But the old lady became frightened and answered, "If Lund and Langholm are mine, then the pains of Hell are yours." He died some years later, but had no peace in the grave, he still walks to this very day in Langholm and lets himself be heard at night at different times of year with a terrible voice that resembles neither that of a human or an animal. Many older people from the area will confirm that Markus Kalv is still to be found in Langholm .
