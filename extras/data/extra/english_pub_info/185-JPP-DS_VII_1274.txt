Here in a farm in the eastern most part of Jerslev parish, a strange thing happened about thirty years ago. Their sheep disappeared one night and all the people came out and were going to look for them. After a while, there’s a shout: “We’ve found them now.” That’s what it sounded like to the people, and immediately after there was an answer, “Can I come too?” The man shouts and says yes; but no sheep came, they didn’t find them that night and they went about all night and looked for them and continued until dawn. Finally they found them. There was continual haunting on the farm and in the house, so much that the people could barely stay there. Right nearby there was a big pond, and in the afternoon in broad daylight, wheels and half wagons and other things could appear in the pond, and no one could understand what was going on. There was also frequently a ruckus in the house. They sought out cunning people and even ministers--Jerslev minister was there several times--and after a while they managed to quiet it; but it was really there for many years. Sometimes fifty or so people could stand and watch as something rose up out in the pond. When it disappeared it made strange noises. None of the occupants wanted to stay at the farm and it was finally sold for next to nothing.
