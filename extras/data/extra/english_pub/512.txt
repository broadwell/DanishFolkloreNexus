Two farmhands wanted to try hanging themselves for fun. They drew lots as to who was to hang himself first, and the one who got the lot stood up on a milk stool, bound a rope around a beam, put his neck inside the noose and said to his buddy: "Now I'll kick the stool away, but when I begin to struggle, put the stool under me again." The other farmhand stood there with the stool in his hands and wanted to keep close watch, but at the same moment, a white hare came running very slowly through the barn. The farmhand thought he could catch it, but he couldn't, and when he finally gave up the chase exhausted and came back to the hanging one, he was dead. It was probably the Devil in a hare's shape that wanted to lure the living farmhand away.
