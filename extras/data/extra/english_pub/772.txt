They've heard suicides cry in a mother's womb. Some could see when a suicide was nearby, and could say to others as he passed by: We won't see him anymore. One could see a black dog following them and the Devil haunting them until he got them. One man thought about hanging himself, but had second thoughts about it when he felt something jump on his back and pull him down. He managed to name God's name, and it hopped off and he was saved. A girl wanted to drown herself. She was already down in the water to feel if it was cold. No, it was almost lukewarm, and the meadow had a strange shimmer, she'd never seen anything like it. She wanted to die, but first she wanted to say her Our Father. When she said amen, she heard a horrible scream that echoed across the meadow, and everything lost its beautiful gleam. The water was no longer warm either, and the girl hurried home.
