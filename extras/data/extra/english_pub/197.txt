There was a manor lord at Boller, he was really strict with his peasants, he made them ride the wooden horse and he used several other torture devices. The he got sick and he died too. After him, a new owner arrived at Boller, but he couldn’t stay there because the other one went and haunted there, and he wouldn’t let him be in peace. They got a minister there to conjure him, and he got so far as to get him all the way to Boller water mill. It was at night, and they stood there and fought back and forth, because the manor lord was also somewhat learned; neither one would give in. The miller noticed this and he stuck his head out of the roof and wanted to watch what was happening. Then the manor lord almost got power over the minister and he was about to be forced into the mill pond, but then the miller gets scared and pulls his head back in and creeps into the mill. Now the minister got the power and was lucky enough to knock the ghost down. The reason was that they were supposed to be the only two there while this was going on.
