At another place in Ersted a vagabond came and begged. Then the farm wife gave him a couple of eggs and he put them in his bag with these words, “Wow, my bag really got because of these two eggs.” The husband was making clogs and when the beggar turned around and was about to go, he took the hunk of clog that he was chopping and smacked him on the back of the neck with it so that he flew flat on his face out the door.
