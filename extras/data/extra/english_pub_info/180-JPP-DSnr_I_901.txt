There’s a mound east of Hjørring, just north of the eastern plantation, called Femhøj. There were mound trolls in it, and people saw many times at night that the mound stood on six or eight supports and that the trolls danced in there. Then one of these mound dwellers gets to talking with a man from Hjørring one night and says to him, “We’re moving tomorrow.” – “What?” says the man. “Yes, we can’t stay here because of the Hjørring ding-danger.” They went to Russia and that’s where all these little guys are still supposed to be. Those buggers were really bad about stealing, and then people started making the sign of the cross over everything, so they were forced to leave so they wouldn’t starve to death.
