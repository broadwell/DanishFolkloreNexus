Two farmhands were talking out on the heath about what was going on at home. The one says to the other that he could see what was going on, and he asked him just not to move. Then he lay down to sleep, and the other saw that a white mouse ran out of his mouth. After a while, the mouse came back and ran into the mouth of the sleeping farmhand, who then woke up and could say for certain what was happening at home.
