My grandfather told me about something that had happened that he’d been involved in, it’s him that I’m named after. He and a farmhand were to take turns watching the animals at night, since they were roaming loose, it was during the barley planting time, since back then they sowed barley late. It was right near Rude church, and so they would go into the church entryway and lay down when they wanted to take a nap. So my grandfather had gone in there and lay down, since it was the other farmhand’s turn to keep watch, and he was going about out in the fields. Then he comes running as fast as he can in to him and wakes him up and says, “Ras Kjær, get up, the red ox has disappeared.” Well, then he got up and when he got out of the churchyard, the other one says, “Oh God, I was at a plow and plowed around, I’m so scared. I didn’t see anything, but there was one who put me to the plow and said to me:  Put that one here for me and put that one there for me. So I put my clogs down and followed along, and when I came back to my clogs, then I was free.” Then the two farmhands went along together to get the animals and pull them away. It wasn’t true, that the ox was missing, but he didn’t dare stay out there alone any longer, and he didn’t dare say anything about the revenant there in the church.
