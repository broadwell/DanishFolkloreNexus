A light burned every night at a mound north of Skotrup and west of Børglum kloster (monastery). One morning, someone dug there and since then no light has ever burned there. Supposedly it was Kristen Hejlesen's father who dug there and found a treasure; the mound was on his property. Before that, he was poor and miserable, but now he'd become the richest man on Börglum manor and exchanged 16,000 rixdollars when the bank law changed.
