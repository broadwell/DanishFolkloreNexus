There were several others from Nielstrup who went down to the cunning woman in Vindblæs. They had a son who was sick, and they went down there for advice, but he died anyway. They said that she went constantly winding a bolster of yarn, then she'd unravel it, and then she wound it up again. While they were there, a whole column of wagons drove through Vindblæs and they were going to the market town. Then the cunning woman says, “That baker, he’ll die before he gets home.” It didn’t take too long before it was all over town that he’d died on the road. She could see that in her window, and she must have been somewhat wise.
