Once the coachman from Klavsholm was driving the master and lady along Vissenbjærg way over on Funen, and there was a terrible snowstorm. Then they were supposed to drive through a gate where the gateposts were the jaw bones of a whale. But they couldn’t get through there, and the coachman had to put the privy councilor’s wife on his back and trudge off with her while the privy councilor stumbled along beside him as best he could. Then she says, “Bong wahrhaftig,” that was always the expression she used, “we’ll never make it to town.” ”Yes, we’ll make it to the town, your grace,” said the coachman, and the privy councilor went and huffed, ”Oh little mother, you’re sitting damn well (Let the devil come into me).” Then when they got to a house and wanted to look around, they thought that there weren’t any windows, they were actually on the other side. So they knocked on the door, and a little later the housewife came and opened the door and asked them in. ”Oh, Rasmus, we can’t possibly stay here tonight,” says the lord’s wife to the coachman. But when the housewife had set the table, she was so happy because it was nice and orderly and they also had nice, clean beds.
