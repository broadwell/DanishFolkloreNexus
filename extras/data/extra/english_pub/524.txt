A bishop had confiscated all the property from a widow. Her son had been abroad, and when he came home along with another man, the widow put food on the table for them. But the most important part of the meal was missing, and that was bread. When the son asked the reason why, the mother said that the bread had been taken by the bishop, and they could go get it there. The son and the stranger then rode over there and avenged themselves on him by murdering him in Hvidbj√¶rg church.
