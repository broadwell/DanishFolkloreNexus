There was another farm where another nis (nisse) lived. But then one fine day, the farmer and the nisse had a falling out, because the man went and insulted the nisse. As revenge for that, he went and wrung the neck of the man's best cow. Now the man realized that it wouldn't do much good to deal with the nisse like that. He tried to reconcile with him, and they became good friends once again. Now the nisse also wanted to show his good side, and right the wrong. The next night he went and got a cow many many miles away and put it in the stall where the previous cow whose neck he had wrung had stood, and the new one was even quite a bit better.
