My father’s neighbor, Johan Nielsen from Skårupøre near Svendborg, had a cutter which he anchored once at Dragør. As the skipper lay at night in his bunk and slept, he woke up when the door down to him was opened, and then he saw a little person like a nisse who said to him: “You will never lay at the big anchor again.” The next morning he went into Copenhagen to an anchor smith and traded his anchor away for a new one, but both he and his crew had to first swear that they knew of no problems with their anchor, and one couldn’t see any either. But as soon as the anchor stock was knocked off, the anchor broke into two pieces.
