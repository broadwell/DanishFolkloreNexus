There was a mound a little bit to the west of Kratgården in Ugilt, called Daniel's mound. A robber who was called Daniel was supposed to have lived in it. The farmhands from Linderumgård went up and kept company with him a bit, and then they decided one night for fun to tie each others' legs up and whoever could get up while they were tied up was the strongest and most ferocious. The farmhands let themselves be bound first and they tried to get up, and they were tied up and let go like that, one after the other. Finally, he was tied up, but then they wouldn't let him go again. He asked them to untie him until he finished swallowing what he had in his pocket. It was a child's heart. He'd already swallowed two and he believed that if he could eat three unborn boy baby's hearts, then no one would be able to defeat him. But they wouldn't untie him. He was executed and, according to what they say, buried in the cemetery where his grave is in the southeast corner. There was a little round mound there they called Daniel's grave.
