Those Ersted men lay out in the woods and stole, and they were vagabonds to boot. The man and the farmhand sat making clogs during the day, and the wife and the girl took care of the animals and the cattle. That was the custom when I was young, but now there isnâ€™t a single farmer who makes a pair of clogs. Those langovrede clogs we call black clogs here and the basarer white clogs.
    The men wore long homespun jackets with neither cuffs nor collar, and they had large bags by their sides with metal buttons.
