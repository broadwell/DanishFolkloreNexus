Someone from Himmerland said that one day a man came to a place in Himmerland, and he was so old that his clothes were covered with moss, and he stood the whole time shifting from one foot to the other, that’s how sore they were, but he didn’t say anything. They offered him a sandwich, but he didn’t take it. Then the man of the house went in to get a shilling for him, but when he came back out, the old man had disappeared. They looked about, but he was nowhere to be seen, and they wondered if that hadn’t been the Jerusalem’s Cobbler.
