A man lived in Ravheden, his wife was called Ane Marie. They had brought a tailor to the farm and it was old Ib the tailor, an old funny guy, he was pockmarked and we knew him. So he sat on the table and sewed and the farm wife was going to churn. So she sets the churn in beside the wood burning stove and she was going to do it there but goes out to the kitchen for a bit, just as she was going to start and comes back with a slip of paper, she has it in her hand, something was written on it. She puts this under the bottom of the churn and goes out into the kitchen again. Then the tailor jumps down from the table and grabs this here slip of paper. He wanted to read it but didn't have time to because the farm wife comes in at that moment. He stuffs the slip of paper down his pants and the farm wife begins to churn. After she'd churned for a quarter of an hour, the tailor yells out: “Stop, my dear woman, because now my pants are totally full of butter, they can't hold any more.” Well, then she helped him off with his pants and they were totally full, it was quite a sight. “Now I'll give you five rixdollars,” she says, “if you'll keep quiet about this.” Yes, he promises that, and then he gets the five rixdollars. After they'd gotten the pants clean, he saw what was written on the slip of paper and there was written that she wanted a spoonful of cream from each man in the parish who had cows. But the only thing he forgot was to be quiet because the first place he came to sew he told what had happened with the hag.
