A bachelor, Jens Bovens, who was a shepherd out in the forest came by a place they called "the dead Alders." Then he didn't come home with the cows at midday and they were going to go out and look for him, and when they found him, he was totally crazy. The elves had danced with him, and since that time he didn't grow. He never got any bigger than a little boy.
