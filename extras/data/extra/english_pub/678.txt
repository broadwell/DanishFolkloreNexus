There was a man who lived in Skj√∏rping who had all of his calves bewitched by a witch who sniffed about and made trouble there in the area. He sent for a cunning man who came and inspected the house and discovered that witch fat had been smeared on all of the posts. When he'd seen that, he knew what to do. First, he got all of the witch fat together, and after he had closed and stopped up all the doors and windows, he threw the fat on the fire, but if the witch managed to see the flames, then all of his efforts would have been wasted. While this was going on in the house, the same witch was out in the swamp gathering hay. All of a sudden, she began screaming and running as fast as she could; but because she couldn't see the flames, her face got terribly burned.
