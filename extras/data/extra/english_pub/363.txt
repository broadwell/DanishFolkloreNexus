Bracken aren’t supposed to bear seeds except on Saint Hans eve. There was a girl called Karen Marie, that was Jens Brandstrup’s daughter--she’s now in America--and she came and wanted me to go out into the woods with her that night. We each had some paper with us which had something written on it and she’d written what was supposed to be written. We were supposed to put that paper under the bracken and she said that she got plenty, but I didn’t get any. Those seeds were used to do magic.
