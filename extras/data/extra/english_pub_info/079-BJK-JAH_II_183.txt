There was a forest ranger in Espelund, which is usually called Skovhuset, who was called Jens Rebild. He’d seduced a girl, it might well have been his own wife who put him up to it, since she followed along to the church and opened the church door for her, when she came and was supposed to confess. There were so many people in the church who wanted to hear how the minister would scold them. When they left the church, the wife took the girl by the arm and followed along with her down and out through the churchyard gate. Then she grabbed on to the back of her skirt and lifted it a bit in the air with these words: “Now you’ve seen her from the front, and you’ve also seen her from behind, now you can see her right in the ass.” Then the church-goers had gotten what they’d come for.
