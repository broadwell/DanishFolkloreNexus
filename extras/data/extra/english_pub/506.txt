Once there was a fire in the big Vildmose (Wild Swamp) that had burned for three years without being put out. Then pastor Jermiin put an end to it, he drove out to the swamp and went around the fire. When it reached the spot where the minister had walked, it went out, and then it wasn't too long before the whole fire was out.
