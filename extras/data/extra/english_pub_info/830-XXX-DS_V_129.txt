Last year in November, it was between four and five o’clock in the morning, and it wasn’t too dark, since there were some stars out, I went over to J. Jensen to slaughter a pig for him. So then my dog came just as I came out of the east cemetery gate and really close to Skjold school, he came running between my legs and whimpered. I looked around to find out what was wrong with it, and then I saw a tall white shape come out of the cemetery gate and turn in beyond the cooperative shop, around the west side of the house. It had a normal, even gait. I went a few steps to see where the shape was going, but then there was nothing to see. Immediately I thought that somebody would die soon. So I went into the house, since the woman there was going off to the same man. When the light was turned on, I was about to get sick, but I didn’t say anything at that time. I’ve seen things like that often.
