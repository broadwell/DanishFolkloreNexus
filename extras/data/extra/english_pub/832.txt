There used to be a farm called Hjelmslev on Illerup field up near Hemstok and that’s where the whole district gets its name, since it's supposed to be the center of it. The man on the farm was called Hjelm. There’s no farm now, just a spring. One Sunday afternoon a potter came driving by there. The people had gone to church. He’s allowed to stay there, and he let his horses out to graze. The wagon stood next to a pond and when it got to be evening, the people noticed that the potter went over to the wagon and spoke quietly. Then they realized what kind of a person he was. Then when he had gone off to bed, they went out and tipped the wagon out into the pond and then the robbers drowned. I’ve been to that spring once, and there was a house not too far from there which was called the Hjelmslev house.
