A man went and harrowed out on the field and a young girl who he had went along side and took care of the cattle. Then she happened to mention that she could milk from a harrow's tooth. Well, he'd like to see that, she could go ahead and milk from the red cow. She milked too, but then she said that she was afraid that it would die. "That doesn't matter," says the man, "The cow is mine and if dies, don't worry about it." She milked now so that it foamed. "Now blood is coming," she said. After that he wanted to know from the girl who had taught her how to do that. Well, her grandmother had.
