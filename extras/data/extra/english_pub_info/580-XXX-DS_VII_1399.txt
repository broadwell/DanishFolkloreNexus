All of a sudden, a woman in Assendrup, Værslev couldn’t get cream from her two cows. She went to a woman folk healer and got the advice to buy a new unused pot without bargaining over the price (keeping quiet), fill it with milk and, still keeping quiet, put it over by the chimney on a hot glowing fire, put an unused straw broom outside the door and then lock it, since the cows were bewitched, and the guilty one had to appear soon under some pretext. But the guilty person should not be allowed in under any circumstances and the pot should be tipped over. All of these instructions were followed precisely and the witch was immediately at the door asking for a pail of milk for her father who had become so ill that she believed he’d die before nightfall. But no prayer helped, the pot was tipped over and, with a scream, she took off towards home. The next day she lay and was practically scalded to death.
