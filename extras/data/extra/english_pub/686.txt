My grandmother was out with her uncle on the church road from Brabrand to True. Just as they were walking along, he said, "Go to the side, little girl," and then he took hold of her and brought her over to the other side of the road. They stood still there by the side of the road and he took his cap off. After they'd stood there a little while, he said, "Well, we can walk now." When she wanted to know what it was, he said that it was a funeral procession that had gone by.
