Tangågård used to belong to Peder Okse. A later owner had three sons and three daughters, but the sons were kidnapped by robbers who lived in a cave closer to Frørup. One day the three girls were in Frørup church; but when they went home, they were ambushed by three robbers who took their clothes and jewels from them. Meanwhile these robbers came to the girls’ father’s farm a little later and wanted to sell the loot, but they were caught there and then it turned out that they were the sons who had disappeared.
