There was a man in Skanderborg who was called Lavst Thomsen, he was a skilled merchant and was quite well-off; but he’d bought all of his riches from the Devil with whom he had made a contract. Then a little while passed and he became a bit of a drunk, and things started to backslide. People believed that it was because he was worried that every day he was one day closer to him. One day a man comes driving, he was called Frederik and came from Flensted, and he passed a wagon that had glowing red wheels below and two coal black horses in front. Even though it was a summer day, steam came out of the noses of the horses as if it was a hard frost. There was only one man on the wagon, and he had a cape thrown over his shoulders, he had a pointy beard and a whiplash mustache, his face was thin and he looked quite sinister. He met him near Hårby and when he got to Forlev, the other one was on his way back, but he didn’t think anything about that and continued to Skanderborg. Then he went in to Lavst Thomsen, because his nephew was an apprentice shopkeeper there. Then he told him that the Devil had been there, and he’d stood and listened by the keyhole and heard what had been said. “Well,” says the Devil when he came in, “now the time is up.” – “Yes it is,” answered the merchant, “if you let me be while I tie up my one stocking, then I’ll come along.” – “I’ll allow that,” and then Lavst let it hang and never again tied up his stocking. Then the Evil One had lost his power. People believed that he’d gotten control over him anyway at some point and had cast some spells so he wound up in a peat ditch a few years later and there he’d sat and frozen to death. When the man from Flensted heard the apprentice shopkeeper’s account he knew that the wagon had been the Devil’s. Frederik sat here with us and told us that; his widow is still alive.
