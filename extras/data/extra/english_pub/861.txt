Once there was a skipper from Svendborg who sailed to Norway. On one of his trips over there he met one day a little short man with a broad brimmed hat on who came to him and asked where he was from. “From Svendborg.” “Oh, from Svendborg. I used to live there.” “How is it that you’ve come here?” asked the skipper. “Well,” answered the little man, “I lived in a little mound down there, and had it really good, and hung out with four merchants in the town; will you give them my regards? But then Martin Luther came, and then it rang, and I couldn’t stand to listen to that, so I traveled over here, and now I live near here in a mound real close by.” They parted then but then when the skipper came home and was to look up the merchants, he couldn’t find them or anybody who was called that. Then he went to the minister and they looked in the parish register, and found that it was three hundred years ago that these merchants had lived.
