A poacher ran once here in Rold forest and he’d gotten something in his shoe. When he got down to the marsh by Katkjelde (Cat Kettle) near Gravlev, the witches were sitting there churning, he could see that, since he’d gotten this bracken seed in his shoe, and I suppose he shot at them. On Saint Hans eve they bloom and produce seed the same night in just two hours.
