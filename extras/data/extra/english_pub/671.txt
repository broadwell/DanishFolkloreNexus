Svend Felding lived at Sjelle Skovgård and traveled between there and Åkjær. Then one night he came past a mound and it was standing on a post, and the mound folk danced around it, and they had put their silver out. So he rode up and took it and rode off with it, but they ran after him. He rode out onto a rye field and they couldn't come after him there. Then they begged him to give them their silver back, and if he did he could have whatever he wanted. Then he asked to have the strength of twelve men. They promised him that, but then he wasn't to tell anyone how he'd gotten it because then he'd have to eat as much as twelve men. When he'd become that strong, the manor lord at Åkjær wanted to tempt him into revealing how it had happened, and then he said, "Well, if you'll feed me as long as I live, then I'll tell you." Ever since then, the manor lord had to feed him, and a pot was made so they could cook enough food for twelve men in it. It was called Svend Felding's breakfast pot and was in Åkjær until not so long ago.
