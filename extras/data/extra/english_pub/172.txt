Elias was the first gypsy who settled in Tårs. He lived at Natmandsbank (The Nightman’s Hill) northwest of Tårs church. He came from down in the Hobro district. Jens Hansen, who was supposedly a farmer’s son from up in Tise, got to know Elias’s daughter and married her, and so he wound up living there as well. Elias was pretty well off, but he was also a bit of a snob and wanted people to respect him. Once he’d been in Hjörring to get a nag, which he was going to bring home and have slaughtered, and so now as he’s riding along the road and was a bit tipsy, he meets up with Cotter Jens Tårs from Ugilt up near Hvidevold, and he asks him, “I say my good man, can you spare a few shillings for a poor man?” – “Yes, I certainly can, I was once poor myself.” Jens Tårs then got a couple of shillings and then he ran up ahead and came up to him again down at Fuglsig vase (crossing) and says the same thing. Sure, Elias says sure and gives him a couple of shillings again, since he didn’t recognize him. The third time he came up to him near the music house, as Jens Tårs now knew who he should latch onto, and it was exactly like the other times, he got alms yet again. The music house is just east of Fuglsig and is named after Spille-Ole who lived there.
