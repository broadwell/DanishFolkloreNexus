The same knacker from Hvalløs once helped out slaughtering a horse at Klasholm, and it was slaughtered in the dog yard. They had an enormous dog yard there and a huge number of dogs. So now they were going to get the horse’s body. Now when the executioner’s assistant had stabbed it, it ran at him and was going to hurt him. He screamed and got in behind a tree, but the horse continued to run at him and kick until it died. The coachman was standing up in the barn loft and saw this, but he didn’t dare go down to help him even though he liked him quite a bit because, if he’d done that, he would have lost his job. The knacker as I remember, was dishonest. The coachman said later that it looked horrible, because there was blood everywhere, and the horse jumped like a madman after the guy and if the horse had gotten behind that tree, then it would have been all over for him.
