Back in the really old days, a lot of farms lay spread out about, and the towns weren’t as gathered. There are a few mounds out on Nielstrup field, they call them the Ståbdrup mounds, I went out there and watched the cattle, and below them there’s a dale where there was supposed to have been a farm that was called Tuesgård. The depression there is still called Tuesgård. “We’re going over to Tuesgård with the cows,” we herders used to say. In my childhood, there weren’t any traces of the farm except the cobblestones. Then people had to move together into towns again, because there were so many beggars and gypsies, and the solitary farms couldn’t protect themselves against them. But now its starting again according to the old ways, because people are spreading out now and they’re moving out of the towns.
