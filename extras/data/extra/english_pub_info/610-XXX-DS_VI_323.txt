The wise minister in Snoldelev had an old driver who sometimes stopped and rested in Damhus Inn, near where the people from Br√∏ndbyvester had a piece of road they were responsible for repairing. He told a story that one time when they had been out on a trip (probably to see about some sort of witchcraft), the horses all of a sudden became stubborn, reared, and wouldn't go anywhere. Then the minister says to him, "Grab hold of the reins with your right hand as far out as you can." The driver did that, but it didn't help. "Get down and take the harness off the right hand horse." He did that. "Can't you see anything on the back of the wagon?" the minister said again. Well, now the driver could clearly see that there was a devil sitting in the back there. "Take off the right back wheel and put it up in the wagon, and then drive as fast as you can home." When they got home to the parsonage, the minister said, "Now, can you leave, because now you've gotten something for your difficulties." That was to the Devil, he said that, because it was him who had to be the fourth wheel for the wagon after the wheel had been taken off. Since then, nothing ever went wrong when they were out driving. 
Hr. Andr. Tamdrup Rachlou was the minister here from 1769-1789 and again from 1802-1811.
