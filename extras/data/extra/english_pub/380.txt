The oldest parish clerk that I know of in Svejstrup was Niels Ring. He was first a servant for the manor lord at Venge farm and he appointed him to the position. He was so harsh that once when he punished a young girl, he lifted up her clothes and but her bare bottom up on top of a glowing wood-burning stove for so long that her skin was half burned off when she came down. But then he got too old and the children teased him, they filled his chair with pins.
     The next parish clerk was Søren Jul. He was a clever man, but strict, and when he got angry he’d throw all the boys together in a heap and then he’d walk all over them with his leather-soled clogs and then he’d yell, “You Goddamn wolf children!” But regardless how strict he was, they still played tricks, they did those boys. One of them was called Mads, he’d been born up at his great grandmother’s house. So one day he’d gotten off to a bit of a late start, and when he got to school he wasn’t even finished with his breakfast, since he arrived chewing on a cheese rind and a piece of bread. When he gets there, the parish clerk had just started the lessons. Then his desk mate, Niels Rebslåer, sees his chance and while Mads is sitting there chewing on the cheese rind, he reaches out and shoves it down his throat. Now Mads was sitting there and couldn’t get the rind either up or down. The other children began to laugh and the parish clerk couldn’t control them. “What is going on?” he asks them gruffly. Immediately, Niels Rebslåer jumps up and says, “It's Mads, he’s ingenious!” Regardless of how strict he was, the parish clerk couldn’t help laughing, but they both had to go and get spanked anyway.
