There was a mound man over in Sale. A man who lived nearby was going to bring his child to church and he invited the mound man as well. He asked if Our Lord and Saint Peder were going to be there. "Well, then I won't come, because I was out another time, and he threw a drumstick at me and broke one of my legs. But I'll give you a baptism gift anyway," and he gave a whole bag of money.
