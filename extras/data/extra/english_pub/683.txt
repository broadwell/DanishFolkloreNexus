A woman died in a farm in Dokkedal, Mov Parish, and she showed herself every noon at a specific place in one of the rooms and always as a black shape. Because of that, the room stood empty for a long time, since nobody dared go in there, until one time a man, who understood this kind of thing, got the revenant up and requested to know why it stood there. The man found out that the dead woman, when she was alive, had had a child as a young girl in secret which she had killed and buried under the floor stones in that place where she now walked after death. The man promised to fulfill her wish that the child would be dug up and moved to the cemetery, and then the shape disappeared. The floor was broken up in the specified place and the childâ€™s skeleton found and buried at the cemetery. After that time the revenant was not seen any longer.
