A man in Hajjbjöre remembered one day that he was to drive to the mill, but then he forgot to put the mill grain in the wagon, and the flax was up in one, it had stood there from the day before when he’d been gathering flax. Then he drove to the mill with the flax. Then the miller said to him, when he stopped in front of the mill: What do you want? He wanted to have his grain milled and take it with him. Then he said: “Where’s the mill grain?” – “God, I forgot it, and that’s bad because we were supposed to bake tonight.”
