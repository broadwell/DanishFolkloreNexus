A minister in Mosbjærg had to go up to the cemetery every night for an hour. Then his wife got their coachman to scare him by putting a sheet over himself. He ran in front of the minister from one grave to the next…. “If you’re a person, speak, if you’re Satan, then give way!” He says it three times… He reaches into his pocket and takes out a book… Then he sinks down three inches. Then the farmhand yells, “Father, Father, it's me!” – “Well,” answered the minister, “even if you were my own brother, I wouldn’t be able to help you now.” Then he ran down to the parish clerk and got the church keys, got the wine and bread and gave him the last rites. The minister’s wife was so horrified by this, that she lost her mind.
