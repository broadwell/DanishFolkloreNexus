An old Norwegian walked about here in the area and he was cunning. There were so many moles here in the fields. Then my great grandfather complained to him about that. Then he answered that he could show them to a place so they wouldn't go everywhere. So then he made it so that for many years there weren't any moles except for one place just to the north of the mounds that are out to the north here. The same Norwegian predicted that there were 60,000 rixdollars buried in the middle mound.
