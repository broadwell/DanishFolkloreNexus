There was this little girl who was had to tend the sheep on her sister’s wedding day, and she was so angered by this that she thre herself into a hole down in Gravlev fen, they call it the Cat Kettle. Finally they found her and she was fished out and then she was to be thrown down, because she couldn’t be buried in the cemetery like that. The corpse was put in a wagon with a couple of oxen in front, and then they let them go where they wanted to. But then they went and opened the churchyard gate if the oxen decided to go in there with her. They went up to the church gates too but they just stood there. Then the minister said, “Well, her soul was this close to Heaven, but it couldn’t come in.” They turned the oxen around and shooed them along. Then they went and stopped up where Jens Binderup’s farm now is. It was called Helledi, because there were two farms in Gravlev called Heaven and Helledi. She was buried in a field divider, which is on their field now, and she’s the one who became the night raven which people in the area heard. When it had to go across running water it cried and said, “Ba-u, ba-u, ba-u!”
