There was a forest ranger in Nielstrup, he had responsibility for Hvalløs vie. One afternoon, he sat down there in the forest and a beautiful girl with a pancake for him came and sat on his lap, and then he looked at the pancake, and then he looked at the girl, and he had no idea what he should do with it. Finally he takes his knife up out of his pocket and cuts a cross in the pancake and as soon as he’d done that, both the girl and pancake disappeared. She was just as hollow in her back as a trough. That’s what the man said, and he also said that he’d seen many times some of these elf girls dancing down there in the willows.
