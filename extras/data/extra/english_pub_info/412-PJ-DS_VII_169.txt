There was a witch in Skjoldelev, her daughter could among other things perform that bit of witchcraft, when she came out to the other shepherds, she could milk using a hazel rod and the milk would shake, and she had so much power over the cattle. While the other shepherds had to use rods and whips, she just needed to call, then they’d come, even if they were otherwise uncontrollable. But then the authorities came for her mother, and she was going to be made into a witch, and she was summoned to meet at the meeting place. When she comes in there, they say to her that if she’d leave that magic alone and just take care of herself she'd be left alone, otherwise they’d want to talk to her. But she said that she hadn’t done anything illegal, and if they couldn’t look after themselves then she’d like to try to see if she couldn’t give them something to look after. Then they let her go home, and each one made sure they got home as fast as they could. They’d all become so infested with lice that they couldn’t let themselves be seen because of the shame.
