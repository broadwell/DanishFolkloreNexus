My mother was out one night with her son Kristen. Just as they came past the culvert they saw a big carriage coming towards them. Then my mother says: “I wonder if that is Brøndum minister who is coming driving? What is he doing here?” When they came closer to each other, she could see that that wasn’t the case, because there was a pair of black horses in front of the carriage but they weren’t any thicker than a couple of foals which could be slapped together, and the driver sat and slouched on the bench as if he sat and slept. Kristen said that he saw someone inside the carriage but my mother didn’t see him. They didn’t see anymore of it and [the ghosts] went on their way home to the hill where they had been buried.
