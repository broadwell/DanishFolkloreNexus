A woman had been in Hornum one night and then she met a young man along the road. She was a little bit saucy and so she says: “Can I sleep with you, my boy?” He didn’t answer. But that night there was somebody in bed with her. She decided to sit in a chair and wait the night out there, but he sat under the chair and then it tipped with her in it. She complained about it the next morning to other people, but they said that she was hopeless. Then she went to their minister and he said that there was no danger. Now he would write a letter and she should put it askew over her room door with a nail. Then she was free and the letter disappeared by itself.
