For sprain. With both hands you should stroke down along the place that is hurt, bring the hands slowly up and stroke again and say: Jesus up the mountain went, his right foot he did sprain, down to the blessed earth he went, send him from bone to bone, flesh to flesh, tendon to tendon, let it be just as it was before. In Jesusâ€™ name. Amen. You read this three times.
