Once there was a man in Hajjbjöre, he was going to have some clothes sewn. So he came up to the tailor out there on the field, he’d come from town. “You really should come to sew for me soon,” he said. “I will for sure, but I can measure you right away.” – “Yes, that’s best,” said the man, “because then I’m sure that you’ll come.” – “Sure, give me your sock,” said the tailor. Then he measured him with that. When he now came home to his wife, he was so happy and said the tailor would be coming soon because he’d already measured him with his sock.
