The old one who built Mylenberg, he drove again after his death, he’d appear every now and then with four horses before his wagon. He was called Mylius and the farm was named after him. They called it Skjelhusene, but he wanted to turn it into a big farm, and so he wanted Hvarre farm to be merged into it as well. It was a whole town, but then he lay waste to all the farms. Of course, he had to build just as many houses as there’d been farms, they weren’t allowed to desert hearths like that, but he got the land. Then when Mylius became owner of the farms, he made them sign papers that allowed him to take any of their property that hindered him. After that, he took the meadows from these copyholders and gave them some heath instead. The old copyholders had had permission to graze their animals in the woods, but he forbade them that as well. The woods was to be fenced in. As the old copyholders died off, he took the meadows, and then they were drained and irrigated. That was at the time that there was supposed to be one big manor lord and a lot of small workers.
