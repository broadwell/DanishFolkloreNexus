Once there was an old woman in St√∏rtum who died, she had lived with her son and his wife. After she had been buried, she went again and she was dressed all in white, she went and rummaged about in the bed by the children and out in the barn. Then they looked in the bed and found some balls of yarn and in the barn there was a red skirt that had belonged to the deceased. They took it and hung it in the kitchen, but then the revenant appeared there. One time, when the son's wife went out to the kitchen with a pail of milk, she was standing there. She got so scared that she dropped the milk. She asked the minister if it would be alright if she spoke with her. The minister said that she certainly could, but that she should bring a book of psalms with her, since she would probably wind up promising her something and she would ask her to give her her hand on it, but she should not give her her hand but rather hand her the psalm book. So she asked the revenant once, "What are you looking for, mother?" -- "Five shillings in the red skirt, then I can have peace in the ground, but promise me that you will give them to my daughter, and give me your hand on that." She handed her the psalm book, and she grabbed it so hard that you could see inside it. They cut the skirt up and found five shillings sewn into the waistband. Then they didn't see her anymore.
