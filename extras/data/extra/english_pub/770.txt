Between Varde and Øllevad there are some mounds and some sunken roads where in the olden days there used to be robbers and the place is still called Røverkjælder (Robber Cellar). The manor lord from Endrupholm came riding by there one night. They had a rope over the road, and bells which rang down in the den so they could hear that he was coming and they jumped out and wanted to grab him but only got ahold of the horse’s tail. Then the man takes out his saber and slashes back out at the one who was holding onto the tail and chops his hand off. Afterward, he rides as fast as the horse can run since he wants to get to Varde. But when he gets close, the road is completely flooded with water. He turns the horse around and rides to Gjellerup and asks at a farm if he can bring his horse in and stay there. A little boy and his mother come out and say that he can do that. But at the same time the boy says: “Mother, mother! My father’s hand is hanging there in the horse’s tail.” He recognized it by a ring. In the blink of an eye, the manor lord jumps back up on the horse and rides again to Varde. He prays to God and promises that if he makes it safely over the water that he’ll build a choir box for Varde church. The choir box is really supposed to have been built by him.
