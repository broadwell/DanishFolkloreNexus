Bitte Fanden (Little Devil), Skjærslipper (Knife Sharpener) Lassen and Lovmk Mejer were in a house here in Erslev and they assaulted the husband and wife. They tied her hands in front of her and then took her by the neck two or three times, and then they said, she’s had enough, but she saw them, because she’d covered her face with her hands and didn’t get hurt.
