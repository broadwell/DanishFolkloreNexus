Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter was born the 27th of October, 1827 in Bodholm, Nielstrup, Rud, south of Rud church. Her father came from Nielstrup from a place that is called Sahule. It was moved by the grandfather out of the town and up to Sahulested. Her mother was born in the house that is still right by the church. Her father later bought a farm in Villendrup which Kirsten Marie's brother still has, and she was married from there. She has her stories from her mother and she had them from her father who was also from Nielstrup. At parties, he could gather all the people around him since he was such a good storyteller. Kirsten Marie married Niels MÃ¸ller, and they still live on Hornslet mark, west of the station. One of her daughters has taken the teacher certification exam.
