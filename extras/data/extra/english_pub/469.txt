A boy on Skjers island went one night towards a hillside on the top of which there was a church. As he walked, it seemed to him that the hillside began to glide down towards him, and all of a sudden a man in a long black robe with a black head was standing beside him. The boy made room for him and went down into the road ditch, and they continued walking like that until they reached the top of the hill, then the wind turned and the man disappeared and everything was like it usually was. The boy is still alive and is a man and believes this himself.
