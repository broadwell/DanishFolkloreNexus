Holger Danske is supposed to sit by a stone wall somewhere here in Denmark, and when the enemies come, by the end there are not supposed to be any more men than can stand around the circumference of a barrel band. Then a thorn bush is supposed to grow up out of Viborg lake, and Holger is supposed to come and tie his horse to that and then water it in the lake. Then he will assemble all the twelve-year-old boys and together they will drive the enemies out with flint stones.
