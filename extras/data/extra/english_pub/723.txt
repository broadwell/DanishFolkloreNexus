The plague was supposed to have come ashore west of Sjørring with a ship, and it broke out when people came out from church after they had buried the shipwrecked. The minister keeled over first, just as he stood and tossed dirt on the corpses. It took them really fast, they sneezed three times and then they died. That is where the custom of saying "God bless you," comes from. People who were afflicted became totally black and the grass also became black, that’s where the name "The Black Death" comes from. Kristensen notes: Over the bishop’s grave there is an old strange headstone with a bishop’s staff engraved on it.
