There was a girl in Tørring, she was about ten years old, and early one spring she was tending sheep out in a field right at the entrance to a dale. There was a man on the other side plowing. Just as he’s going along he happens to look about and then a devil had taken the girl and driven her about up in the air down there in the dale. The girl screams wildly because of this. Then the man stopped and began to read his Our Father, and when he’d read it three times, the devil let her go and she got away unharmed.
