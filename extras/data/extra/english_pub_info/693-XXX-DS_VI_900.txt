There was a man from Ty whose pigs had disappeared. He went to Jens Plovgård in Ramme to ask about them. It was night when he got there and Plovgård wasn't home. The wife showed him out to the barn, he could sleep there that night. When the man got home late that night, the wife told him about the foreign man and what his errand was. He went out to the barn where he called the Black One forth and asked him about the pigs. The man, who was lying out there, saw and heard everything, he heard what was said, they were lying in his neighbor's dung heap. Then the man left before daybreak and went home to Ty, since he'd heard where they were himself.
