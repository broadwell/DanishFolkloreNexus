There was a peddler or a Hamburg-Jew, who walked about the area and he was killed. It was here in Obbestrup, Gunderup parish that it happened and the peddler was on his way to Nøvling. The peddler gets a farmhand to come along with him from there and show him the way, and then the farmhand kills him and robbed him of what he had. Before he killed him, seven gray geese flew by. Then the Jew says: “They’ll be my witness, that you killed me.” The farmhand then ran away and was gone for twenty years. Then he came back to the same farm that he had been in service at, but they didn’t recognize him. At that point he had become a really rich horse dealer and it was at harvest time that he arrived. They asked him to help them harvest and he did. Then they harvested on the place where he had buried the Jew. Then these seven gray geese come from the east and go towards the west and then the wife says, “God save us, the gray geese are coming too early, I’m afraid they’ll eat the oats.” But there was a gander among them and he says to the horse dealer: “There where you’re walking, that’s where you killed St. Peder.” Then the horse dealer admitted it on the spot and he was executed on the spot where he had earlier buried the other one, and he was also thrown into the ground in the same place. Nothing grew on that place, it didn’t matter what they planted, nothing would grow there. It’s still a barren place to this day.
