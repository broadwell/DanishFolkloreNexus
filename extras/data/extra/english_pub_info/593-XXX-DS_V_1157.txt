A woman died before she managed to give birth and since then they never got peace because of her. She went amid the stubble [in the fields] and they heard her cry: “I got too little for one and not nearly enough for two.” Then they told the minister about this, he requested some of the unborn child’s clothes, which he laid out amid the stubble, and then the disturbance ceased. The minister believed that she had given birth to two children in the grave, since those who don’t give birth when they’re alive give birth in the grave, that’s what the old sayings say.
