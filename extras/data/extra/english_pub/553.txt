There was a man who was called Svanbjærg, he never missed a shot when hunting wild things. One time another man saw him shooting at a hare, but it was already so far away that he couldn’t reach it, he didn’t shoot right at it either. Nevertheless he came with the hare, it had been felled by the shot. 
     That same man also liked to fish. Then he fished one time in Mørk Lake, a little deep lake out on Vest heath, some people also believe it is bottomless. But then it went wrong for him. Because that time he got a red spotted calf in his net and it tore it to pieces for him, and he had to go home that day with unfinished business. He believed that the calf was the Devil.
