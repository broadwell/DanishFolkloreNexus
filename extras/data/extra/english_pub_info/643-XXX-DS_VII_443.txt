A minister had a farmhand and every morning when he woke up, he was so tired and he was so sore in his limbs, he felt like he had being doing the hardest work. Then he sought the advice of a male folk healer, who told him the reason for his illness. It was namely the minister’s wife who threw sleep on him and, by putting a witch bridle on him, she turned him into a horse and then rode him to Troms. He was so tired from that the next morning and had sore limbs. Then he advised him that the next St. Hans Eve when he lay down in bed, he should rub his neck down hard into the pillow and continue to do that even if he fell asleep. He tried that. During the night he woke up and he was standing by a church and had a bridle in his hand, it was tied to the church hitching post, and round about stood a huge crowd of horses, who were tied in the same way. A little later the minister’s wife came out of the church and he threw the bridle over her head, following the wise man’s advice, and immediately she was changed into a beautiful black mare. He sat himself up to ride and rode home to the parsonage. He got there at dawn and when the minister came out of the door to greet the rider, he wasn’t just a little surprised when he saw that it was his own farmhand who came riding. Then he told the minister that he’d bought this beautiful black mare, and didn’t the minister want to buy it from him. Yes, he liked it and then the deal was made. The farmhand asked next if he shouldn’t ride it over to the smith and have the mare shod, because it needed it. The minister consented to that and when the farmhand came back with it, he pulled the bridle off and the minister’s wife stood there with horseshoes on her hands and feet.
