There was one who was ridden by the mare and he was really hard on him. They locked the doors and kept a look out but the mare went in there anyway. Then he noticed that it always came up from his feet and so he took the cutting knives from the threshing machine and put them so that if anything came it would get caught in the knives. After that he never noticed a thing, but a few days later they heard that there was a person a mile or so away who’d cut open his stomach one night and then they figured out that it was him who was the mare. 
     All those people whose eyebrows grow together over their nose, they’re mares, and a common remedy for getting rid of them is to turn one’s clogs backwards by your bed, because it has to put those on before it goes into your bed.
