There are stories from Laven, which is near Sejs, about elves. A small earthen hut was built by the charcoal piles where the people who were supposed to watch the charcoal piles could take shelter from the weather. There was often a fire burning in front of the hut, so they could warm themselves by it and also to provide light, and a man often saw elves come and warm themselves and dance around the fire. He wanted to try and scare them and he took an ember out of the fire and threw it at one of them. But what happened next he didnâ€™t know. When he regained consciousness, his charcoal pile was split apart and he himself lay a ways away from the earthen hut and was almost frozen solid.
