Kirketorup minister had a mute coachman. They drove once and were supposed to go to Bislev, and the coachman couldn’t say anything and hadn’t learned any finger language or anything like that as they do now. They were to give the last sacrament to a woman, and she died too, while they were there. The coachman cried for her, since it was terrible, but the minister couldn’t understand that, since he thought it was a good death. Then they drove to the parish and drove down Ejdrup hill, and this was during the winter. A man came driving towards them and one of the horses kicks out, and cleaves the man’s forehead so he falls backwards out of the sleigh and died immediately. The coachman laughed so hard over this, and the minister thought that it was strange that he could laugh at that. Then the minister prayed from the pulpit for seven years that his coachman could talk so he could tell him why he cried when the woman died such a good normal, peaceful death in her bed and laughed when the man died so poorly. Then he also got his voice and said the raven took her soul while the dove took his soul and that’s what amused him. This isn’t a story, it’s a true incident, but it happened a long time ago.
