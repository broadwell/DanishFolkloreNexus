There was a man on Linderumgård [Linderum farm], he was the one there before Captain Skjærul, and he could never get an ox handler because there was a huge black ox that went about in the steer house, and they were scared of it. He had had four handlers that winter, and the fifth also wanted to leave. But he got him to stay there for eight days and see if there wasn’t a change. The handler bound the oxen every single night, drove him into the ox stall, and tied him there but in the morning it was gone. Then he got quite disturbed and wanted to leave, he didn’t dare stay there any longer. Then the farmer says to him that he could come visit him that night, then he’d make him a harness that he could bind around the ox. The handler comes and he tosses him a cable that was made with four twisted wires and he was to put that around the neck of the ox and tie it in a special knot in it that he showed him, and then he was supposed to tie him up with that. The next morning the ox had turned into a large black slender calf, and it lay there in the harness. Then the handler goes to the barn and gets all the farmhands, they had to come and see this beautiful thing. They all come there to see. Then he goes over and loosens the knot on the iron cable. Then the calf jumps up and runs out of the lower door. But at the same time, he farts and it can be heard all over the farm, and the smell wouldn’t go away for the next eight days. He never came there again, and then the farmer could get enough handlers.
