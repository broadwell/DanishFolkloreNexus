A fifteen or sixteen year old girl worked at Børglum monastery and, according to the other girls, she was cunning, because she could make their gloves and clogs dance. They told the manor lord—that was Chamberlain Hillerød—that if he didn't get rid of her they would leave. One day they were all going to leave. Then the chamberlain said to the coachman that he should harness up the wagon, they were going to go out driving, and he takes the girl along with him in the carriage. Then they drive to Børglum parsonage and he gets the minister to come along too. Then they drive to the town Vitrup which belongs to the manor. When they get there, there’s a bunch of red cows that belong to some cotters out on the field. Then the chamberlain says that she should go out and milk a cow until it died, could she do that? Sure, she could do that easily. She jumps down and milks so long until she milks pure blood and then the cow died immediately. Then they drive to Åsenterp. There she also does small magic with cows and calves and the dean and the chamberlain sit and watch. Finally on the way home they come to a windmill, which stood west of the farm, and now that it was still weather, they asked her if she could get the mill to turn. Then she got the mill started and then the dean says to her, “Now that’s enough!” and they drove home to the monastery. They were supposed to go into the church now and there the minister re-baptized her. After that she was like an infant, she completely lost her senses, and she couldn’t do a thing. The one who told me this had seen the girl himself many many times. He was called Tulli-Lars. The Tulli name he’d gotten from a family that lived up in Nørre Harridslev. The son from there was a grocer in Løkken and was called Tulli-Andreas.
