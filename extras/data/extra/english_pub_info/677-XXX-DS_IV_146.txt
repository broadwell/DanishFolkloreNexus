In Skørping parish, in Buderupholm forest, there's a place called Skørping holme, and it is surrounded by moats and walls. During Queen Margrete's time, there was supposed to have been a robber band that worked out of a well-fortified fort. On Sunday, they would go to one of the nearby churches where they pretended to be very pious; but on the way home they would rob and plunder widely. No one could take them on since they were too strong for the poorly armed peasants. In their need, the local peasantry sent a call for help to Queen Margrete. She came with a well-armed group one Sunday when the robbers were at church. So they wouldn't realize something was up, she had her troops put their horseshoes on backwards so that the heel faced forward, and they rode into the robbers' fort that way. When they got back, the robbers couldn't see anything other than horse tracks going out of the fort, so they thought they were their own, and they rode into the fort without worry. But here they got such a warm reception from the Queen's knights that they never went on any more expeditions; and while this was going on, Margrete sat on a mound outside of the fort where she could observe everything. The fort was destroyed, but the field and the ruins of the walls can still be seen, as well as the mound where the Queen watched the events, and to this day it still carries the name Queen's Mound.
