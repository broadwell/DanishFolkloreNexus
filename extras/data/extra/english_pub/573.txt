A man from Tørring, Ras Poulsen, was at a wedding at Jon’s out on Jævngyde field, and when he went home at night and came to Rander Krog, there was someone plowing. Then he had to go and plow for it, and wasn’t free before daybreak. He had to drive all night. When day broke, all of it disappeared and he didn’t know where it had gone. “Then I went home, damn it.”
