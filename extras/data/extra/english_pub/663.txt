The elf king is supposed to stay in those parts of the country where the country’s king has yet to go. That is supposed to be the case in Stevns province. About thirty years ago, the elf king made his way through one of the Tåstrup outlying farms and disturbed not only the people’s peace, but much more the geese’s peace because they (the geese) had to wander about for two or three hours after he’d gone through there, and they went about in pairs with the cry, “Kjæk, kjæk, kjæk!” If that happened because they were forced to or not is not known but they didn’t forget to nod whenever they passed the gate. Then one of the gates was moved somewhere else.
