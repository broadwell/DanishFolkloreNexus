One day I walked past a grass snake that had a frog in its mouth, so that its back legs were still sticking out. Then I poked at it and it let the frog go and slithered away, and the frog hopped away. A Swede, Jens Karlsen, said that I should have gone in between them because then I would have saved a woman having birthing difficulties.
