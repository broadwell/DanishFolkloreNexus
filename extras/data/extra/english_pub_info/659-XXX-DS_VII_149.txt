The same minister's wife in Hassing who had used the farmhand as a horse when she rode to Troms church, and finally been shod with iron horseshoes on her hands and feet, she had also done things in her previous husband's day. He was a curate, but whether it was more than the title that he carried, I'll leave unsaid. Then there was a wedding there in the parish to which he had been invited as well. While the guests were sitting at the tables, a white cat came in and walked back and forth across the floor. One of the guests, who had more than normal abilities, said to one of the others: "Please step aside, and let the curate's wife pass." But as soon as he'd said that, she was standing there as naked as the day she was born instead of the cat. As soon as her husband saw that, he sunk down under the table he was sitting at and died right then.
