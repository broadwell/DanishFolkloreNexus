A hundred years ago, a really big tomcat had come to Boller water mill and he bit all the other cats to death, and he ate everything he could get. A half a year went by, and then a man came there driving mill grain from Ronnebjærg in Vrejlev and he says to the mill hand, “It was strange. Just as I came over Ronnebjærg bridge, a cat came running out of the mound there, which is right beside the road (it is just to the northern and western side) and says to me: Please say to Jafet when you get to Boller mill that Dafet is dead." Then the cat that was walking about in there says: “Then I'd better go,” and then it went west from Boller out to the mound. Then they didn't see the cat any more, and people were glad about that because it was so horrible about eating and stealing. But one can probably figure out that those gentlemen in the mound had been fighting and therefore one of them had left the mound as long as the other one was alive.
