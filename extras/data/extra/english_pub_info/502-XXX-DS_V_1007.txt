A soldier, who was working at a farm, got sick and died there. He had six daler in his trunk in a special place so that people could not find them easily.Then he had a younger brother who was lying up in a room at home, and he could see him at night standing fiddling with his trunk, which had been placed in the main room. It had been brought home and placed there. This boy then tells the others about what he'd seen. "Ask him what he wants," his parents said. He didn't dare do that, but then he got his father in there one night. He could see him too, and he asks him what he wants. Well, he'd hidden some money between the inner chamber and the trunk. The next day, the father examined the place and found the money and since then they never saw him again.
