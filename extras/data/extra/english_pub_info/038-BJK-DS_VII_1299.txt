There was one in Gravlev they called Anders Bødker, and he bewitched Kræn Degn’s field on Fløø. There was a place as big as a spinning wheel and as soon as the cattle got there they went completely crazy. They couldn’t raise any barley either. But then Jakob Ingvarsen he cured the field. It was one time when the men of Gravlev had gathered--in the old days, the townsmen often gathered--and Anders Bødker was also there, and the Fløø men were also there. It was over at Poul Isak’s, that's where they were, and then someone says, “Can’t you give us half a pægl  Poul?” Sure, they got that then. “Skål, Anders Bødker, now you should let us raise some good barley,” one of them says, that was Jakob. “Sure, you’ll get some good tall standing barley,” says Anders, he was such a joker he was. Then all the men wanted to pour a glass for him to get good barley, and Kræn Degn sat there quietly listening to that. 
     Anders Påske’s plow in Fløø had also been bewitched one afternoon, when his son had had the animals out in front, and then he couldn’t control the plow at all that afternoon, either it would go too deep or up out of the ground or to the side. Then he had to unhitch the animals and go home to his father. Yes, evil people had done that, and then they had to go over to Iver Ott, he was old Villads’ son-in-law, and he’d inherited all of his knowledge. So the man hitches up his wagon and drives over to him. He came over and read in his books to find out what was wrong with the plow and then he followed him home and read over the plow and screwed on all of the screws. He had a little drill in his pocket and as well as a little stick, and when he’d drilled a little hole in the plow axe, he tapped the stick into it. “Now it won’t give you those problems anymore,” he said, and then the plow went as wonderfully as it had before.
