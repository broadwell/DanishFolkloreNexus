A vagabond came to a farm in Årestrup where Jens Smed lived and he wanted to beg. Jens Smed takes a cake and cuts a piece and gives it to him. But he threw it down onto the table and said he couldn’t eat bread without anything on it. – “You scoundrel, can’t you eat bread by itself? I’ve been places where we had to eat raw horse meat and be happy that we could get that.” He’d been a soldier for eleven years you see. He gave him a few smacks with a wheel spoke, and then he could go off with that.
