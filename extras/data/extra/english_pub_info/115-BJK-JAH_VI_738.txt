Provst Cilius from Smårup said during a sermon, “Lord, you gave me lamb, but how were they? Some were white and black, red and damn foolish.”
      In a prayer for rain he said, “Lord, you gave us rain, but it fell in Nörlund woods and Sorte-Mose; the furthest drops barely reached Sundsig on my field, and because of this my rye now stands there with its laps by its ears.”
     He said to someone that he’d gone to give the last sacrament to, “I can see death approaching, and you’ll leave this witches’ feast.”
