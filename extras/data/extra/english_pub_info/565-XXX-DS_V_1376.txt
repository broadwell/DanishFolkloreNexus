One night a farmhand asks me if I don’t want to go over to Egebjærg, and then we could walk together. After a while, we’re supposed to go home and we go along together over past the bleaching ground over near Hostrup main farm. Then the farmhand sees a woman. “That’s probably the servant girl”, he says, “who is out to get something that’s been bleached. Be quiet,” he says, “then we can follow her!” Then she comes over and looks right into his face, and she was so chalk white and was dressed in all white clothes. It gives me a terrible scare, and I take a step aside, and then I go into the big room, and after I’ve sat there a while, I go up to my room. The lady continues to follow the farmhand up to his room and smacks him out cold in front of his room and, when he gets into his room, she smacks him out cold again and tears at him so that he is wripped out of his clothes. He was also afraid of getting into bed because of her, and his clogs rattled really loudly. It was a young woman who had killed her child out in the bleaching yard and had her walk up toward Skakkenborg mound out in the field.
