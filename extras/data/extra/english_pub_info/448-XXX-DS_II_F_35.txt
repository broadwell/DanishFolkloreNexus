A cotter, whose wife was pregnant, came home one evening after work. The door was locked so he had a hard time getting in, but the earth was dug up one place under the threshold. When he came into the main room, his wife was lying on the bed and was dead, and her belly was ripped open. Then the poor man knew who had done it, and he looked about the house, and found the werewolf sitting in the muck pile, eating the child.
