There’s a large dale in Rold woods, they call it Vintønden, it runs from Sorte mose (black bog) to the west, and it is the boundary between Ravnkjeld and Årestrup parishes. It is also the language divide, and Rold river also marks the boundary. East from Sorte mose runs Skjeldale (Boundary dale). In Ræbild, they say “søen, bette, nøddes (cow house)”. In the north in Hornum they start saying: “kan” instead of “kand,” “hunen” instead of “hunden.”
