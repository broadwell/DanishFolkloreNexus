There is a land surveyor who haunts near Torsbj√¶rg, west of Vorde church. He had placed some boundaries incorrectly. Many people have heard him dragging his chain every night. One dark morning, I was supposed to move the horses and I was on my way home, I heard a horrible rattling of a chain. Now I'd heard the old stories and never been as scared as I was then. But when I got closer to it, I discovered it was the minister's dog.
