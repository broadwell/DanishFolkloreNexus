It was at the time when the fields were partitioned, there was one who lived in Skindbjærg and he gives his farmhand a rixdollar to move the marker into his neighbor’s field. The farmhand was supposed to move the marker twelve feet, that was an acre, and the neighbor was called Mads Sørensen. He moved there from Knud in November and moved to Horsens, and the next summer he got typhus and died. Then when he was buried he sought his way back to Knud’s place. When Knud came out at night, he stood right there, chalk white, outside the door. Knud knew what it meant and he closed the door again. But after that, every time he watered the jades in the evening, they saw that he came up again, just as chalk white, and the people were scared of him. Knud had to go up to the minister now and get him down there. They called the parish clerk Grejs Grå and he was the driver for the minister from Skindbjærg. When they had been down there a little bit, the ghost appears. This here Mads Sørensen had been told to come along with a chevron, since he was supposed to be there to move the marker back again. Then when the revenant had come, the parish clerk says to the minister, that he should go out to him. Well, he really didn’t want to. Then he’ll do it, says the parish clerk, and then he went out to him. Then after they’d talked together, the parish clerk says to Mads Sørensen and Knud that they could come now. The parish clerk follows the dead one now to the place where he had dug the hole and then to where he had moved the marker from. They continued that way until they had done the entire dividing line. Then the ghost says when they get to the end of the line: “If you will forgive me, God will forgive you.” Mads said yes, and then immediately the other one disappeared. Then when they were going to go home, the minister says to the parish clerk: Now he could get up in his seat, because he was his master. He used to say “du” to him, now he said “I”.
