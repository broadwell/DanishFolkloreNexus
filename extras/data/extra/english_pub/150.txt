There was a minister in Torslev who was called Deichmann. He used to read for the candidates for confirmation out on the church floor. One day as he was reading along, a big black dog came in to the church floor. He kept pushing the children so they all wound up in the choir loft and the dog followed along behind. But then the minister left the church and the dog followed but the children stayed inside. Then he was outside for half an hour and then he came back inside again. He was so changed then that the children didn’t recognize him. Then the minister says to them that if when they got home they talked about what had happened in the church that day then they wouldn’t be confirmed by him. Nobody saw the dog again and the children talked about it anyway. But people kept quiet about it so the minister didn’t find out.
