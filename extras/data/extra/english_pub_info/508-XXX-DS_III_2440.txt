A man (who as far as I remember was called Bang) came to one of Scheelerâ€™s manor farms in Jutland, and stayed there overnight. He had a dream that a figure appeared by his bed at about midnight and told him that a treasure had been walled in above the door in an iron chest, and that the ruling Count Scheel had a gold key which fit it, and told him how the stones were arranged there, so it would be easier for him to find. The next day he continued his journey and in the stagecoach he told the dream to the person sitting next to him. A year later he coincidentally met up with Count Scheel and began to talk to him about this matter. The Count said that he had, as a matter of fact, received a small gold key from his grandmother, but what it fit, he had never known. He went home now and had the archway inspected, but found only an empty room and tracks suggesting that it had been recently searched. What supported this even more was that the man from the stagecoach bought a large manor farm down by Slesvig shortly after, although he had never been known as a wealthy man.
