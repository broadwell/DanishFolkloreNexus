An old rope maker in Svejstrup told that there were two men who had bad blood between them. Then they died and when they were buried, a hand grew out of each of their graves and they stood there and threatened each other. Then people thought that it was such a gruesome sight that they chopped the hands down and made a little box which they put them into. Every New Year's day, they were carried around among the people. But the odd thing was that no matter how often one switched the hands around, they always switched themselves back. One always wanted to be on top, as did the other one, and at that time they were always going on top of each other. It was so that the one always wanted to rule over the other.
