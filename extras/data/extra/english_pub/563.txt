Little Hanne VÃ¦vers from Bjarselv was the kitchen helper at a funeral. It was a four or six year old child who had died. She stayed the night, and during the night, after the body had been buried, she felt something and said the next morning, "A child is going to leave here soon again." She'd heard driving in the courtyard, just like when the body was driven away the day before. A child died fourteen days later there, too. It wasn't sick except for a single night.
