Ry River is very deep, and it is supposed to yell out each year: “The time has come, but the man has yet to come,” and then somebody drowns. One time, nobody had drowned for twelve years, but then it happened that twelve threshers who had been working at Birkelse during the winter were walking home at night, all twelve of them drowned. Because if it is carried over one or more years, then the river takes all of them it has due all at once.
