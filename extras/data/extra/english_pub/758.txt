A man in Hesselager close to Nyborg had a swamp in which there were elves. One day his wife baked and put the bread outside of the house in a dough trough; but the elves wanted them and took all of them. A little girl, who saw that, told the wife and she told it to her husband when he got home. Then he got really angry and started to dig in the swamp after them. He didnâ€™t find them, and the elves became annoyed and bothered him in all sorts of ways, until finally they bothered him to death. After he died, no one noticed them any longer.
