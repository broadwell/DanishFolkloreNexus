The people in Hallendrup had a nisse, and the people in Ginderup, they had one too. Then the Ginderup nisse decided that he wanted to go over and steal in Hallendrup and then he asked one who was called Terkild, the nisse did, if he didn’t want to come along and steal oats over there. Terkild said sure, they could do that. Then they went and they took as much as they each could carry. When they got half way home, they met the Hallendrup nisse, he’d been in Ginderup stealing oats. Now the two started fighting and in the mean time Terkild climbed into a tree trunk that was to the side there. When they were done fighting, the Ginderup nisse had won. He then speaks up and says to Terkild, “Can you see, Terkild in the trunk, I’m still standing.”  They got their packs on their backs again, and then they tramped off with them. A little bit later, Terkild says, “Let’s take a rest.”—“What, can we rest?” says the nisse. “If I’d known, I could have taken twice as much as I’ve got.”
