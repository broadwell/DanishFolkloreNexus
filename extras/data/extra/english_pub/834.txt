Once my father and my paternal aunt Else here from MÃ¸ltrup had gone out to look for some calves. They came to a three-way fork in the road, and then they came across the calves without knowing how, but when they looked closer, it was a big white headless steer. Else got so scared that she fell to her knees, and he said: "Go ahead and say the Our Father and I will put my vest on backwards." When they'd done that, they ran home, and then they hurried up and stirred the fire before they went inside.
