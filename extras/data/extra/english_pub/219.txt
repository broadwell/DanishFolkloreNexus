A bricklayer journeyman who was named Ketting worked here in Linderumgård thirty years ago. He was so strong that he could lift two horses at once. A belt was strapped around the horses and then he could go in between them and lift them. Once he bet the feed master at the farm, he was called Ammidsbøl, that he could pull a load of gravel from the pit with one hand that the horses couldn't pull. He won twenty rixdollars that way. He could lift a mortar tub up onto the wall which two men couldn't get off the ground. But he was also seventy-seven and a half inches tall.
