Down near Skjødstrup there was a mound, there was so much alder wood near it, and there were a lot of elves. They danced so happily up on the mound. Then there was a boy who went and took care of the cattle, he really enjoyed watching them. Finally they surrounded the boy and he couldn’t get out anywhere. Their farmhand was plowing right nearby and then he rode into the circle and grabbed the boy and rode home with him. But the boy was so strange after that. He always used to say that he wanted to go out to the elves.
