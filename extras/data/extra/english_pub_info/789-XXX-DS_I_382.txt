I knew a man who said that in his younger years, when he worked at Løjt in Åbenrå, one morning before dawn, he walked out in the field to move the horses, which stood bridled out on a grass field where there was a mound. At the foot of the mound lay a peel board that was broken. He took it home and fixed it, after which he went over and placed it down in the same place where he’d found it. Before lunch he went back out to the field to move and water the horses and there lay a wonderful cake; he got that because he repaired the peel board. The mound woman had baked bread that morning.
