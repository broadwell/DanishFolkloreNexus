My mother said that the mound folk danced near Dakbjærg. When the sun was shining, they could see how the mound folk danced, it was so beautiful because it was just like watching well-dressed girls. 
      They were out mowing during harvest and then there was a girl who had seen that, and she said to the others when they were going home to eat lunch: She would rather stay with the Dakbjærg women and dance with them while they went home. When they came back, they found her corpse, she had danced herself to death.
