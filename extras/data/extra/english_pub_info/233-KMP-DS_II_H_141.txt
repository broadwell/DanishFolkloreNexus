They said that there was a headless horse that went up and down the streets in Nielstrup. Some people said that it wasn’t true, but Niels Bødker said that it was true, because the horse had stuck its head in the window of his chaffing room while he stood there cutting chaff. Later, when he was a grown man, he lived in Nielstrup.
