My great grandfather was named Fanøe and was a district clerk. He lived in Hovgårds mill, and rode twice a week to the assembly. It alternated between Løkken and Nørre-Sundby. At that time, there was no highway, and one night while he was riding home from Sundby and came out into the Atrup meadows, a steer came after him. He couldn't ride that fast, and it followed him, and it continued like that for a good mile. When he got to the eastern-most edge of West meadow, it stayed there. My great grandfather believed that it was Lucifer himself he had fallen in with and believed that it didn't go back to its flock.
