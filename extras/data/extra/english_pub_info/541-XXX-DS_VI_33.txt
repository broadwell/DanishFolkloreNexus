Once there was a minister in HÃ¸jelse who, according to what people said, could be two places at once. One day the minister went off to Copenhagen and was to be away for a while. Then one of his hired girls, who wanted some fruit or another in the garden, she went down there and was just about to pluck it. At that moment, the minister came walking up. She had to take off. That happened many times.
