DANISH FOLKLORE PROJECT STAND-ALONE DISC README

===============================================


The digital content that accompanies this book is designed to offer 
a thick immersive experience in the Evald Tang Kristensen collection. 
The project focuses on five main storytellers -- "Bitte Jens" Kristensen, 
Jens Peter Pedersen, Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter, (Ane) Margrete Jensdatter, 
and Peder Johansen -- and the content accessible from the user interface 
is arranged around their repertoires. The user interface is designed to be 
accessible on any computer irrespective of whether it is connected to 
the Internet or not. 

The main user interface launches in a web browser, and requires Adobe's
Flash Player software. 

When connected to the Internet, one can access historical and contemporary 
maps of Denmark, as well as all of the map layers related to the
storytellers, their stories, and Tang Kristensen's collection journeys. 

When not connected to the Internet, these maps are accessible through a 
stand-alone map viewer application called ArcReader.

It is possible to access the text-based resources, images and scanned manuscript pages via the Web browser-based interactive folklore viewer
even without an active Internet connection. 

Simply follow the instructions given below for accessing the collection via the browser-based viewer. When you are working offline, the rest of the
interface will display properly, but the map window will remain blank.

Easy Set Up

In addition to having a working Internet connection for your computer, 
you will need to run the install program provided on the disc that
corresponds to your computer's operating system.

Mac OS X: 
Double-click the Mac OS Installer application inside the INSTALL folder on the disc.

Windows: 
Double-click the Windows Installer.bat file inside the INSTALL directory on the disc.

After running the install program, you should shut down any running Web
browsers before attempting to access the folklore viewer.

In some cases, this easy set up procedure will not work. If your browser
displays an error message when you try to open index.html, follow the
instructions below.

Accessing the Folklore Collection via the Browser

To view the folklore collection via the interactive interface, simply 
double-click on the index.html file inside the Danish Folklore folder on
the disc, or manually open this file with your preferred Web browser.

-----------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting access via the browser

If the install program fails for some reason, you will see an error
message when you try to open index.html with you web browser. Most of
the interface will remain blank, although a map may appear in the map
window.

First, try shutting down your Web browser and running the install program again. 

If the maps still do not appear, one possible solution is to grant network 
access to the viewer manually, via the Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager. 

You can access the settings panel directly by pointing your browser to this address:

http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html

Under the Global Security Settings tab in the Settings Manager window
(the tab looks like a globe with a padlock in front of it), it is best to
have the Always ask button selected. 

Then add the location of the Danish Folklore files on the disc to the
 Always trust files in these locations box. 

To do this, click the Edit locations... pull down menu and select Add
location...

For systems running Mac OS X, the best value to enter into the Trust this
location: field is:
/Volumes/DFL/Danish Folklore/

For Windows-based systems, the location of the files will be the letter of
the drive  containing the Danish Folklore disc, followed by the Danish
Folklore directory. 

For many Windows-based systems, this value will be:
D:\Danish Folklore\

Once you have entered the trusted location in the input field, click Confirm. 
You have now instructed the Flash Player to allow the Danish Folklore 
viewer access to the XML data files stored on the disc.

For these new settings to take effect, you must quit your Web browser and then re-open index.html file in the Danish Folklore folder on the disc.

-----------------------------------------------

Accessing the maps offline

You can still access the historical maps and the various map layers even if your computer is offline. 
To do so, you must install ArcReader, which is available online:
http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcreader/download.html

Once you have downloaded and installed ArcReader, you can open the local 
historical maps by selecting Launch Local Maps from the About tab at the 
top of the browser-based user interface. 

If that fails to launch properly, double click on the file localmaps.pmf in the Danish Folklore folder on the accompanying DVD. 

If that fails to work, open ArcReader and then open the file localmaps.pmf 
from the Danish Folklore folder on the accompanying DVD. 

The content of the various layers is explained in the section How to Use this System.

-----------------------------------------------

Installing a Web Browser and Flash

If your browser is unable to display the Danish Folklore data, you may 
need to install an appropriate web browser and Adobe Flash software. The
interface should work with any browser that supports Adobe Flash Player.
These include the most up-to-date versions of Mozilla Firefox, Safari for 
Mac OS X, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome.

You can download and install the latest version of Adobe Flash Player from
this address:
