The girl at Vorgård teased the gårdbuk (nisse). One day when they were baking, and the bread had been taken out of the oven, the gårdbuk came after her. She crawled into the oven, made a cross over her mouth and turned her apron around, then she figured she was safe. But then he said: “Yes, cross over the mouth, but little Niels can go in through the spout” Now little Niels crawled in through the spout and crushed the girl to death. The girl didn’t think that he could crawl through such a little opening.
