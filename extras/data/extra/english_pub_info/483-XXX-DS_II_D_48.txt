Liver River, which runs a half mile west of Hj√∏rring and drains into the ocean near Tornby, has a bad reputation. Every year, it craves a human life. Some times they've heard the following words come from the river: "The time has come, but not the man." Then it isn't too long before a person drowns, and the person who is chosen can't avoid fate, since they'll have no rest until they come down to the river.
