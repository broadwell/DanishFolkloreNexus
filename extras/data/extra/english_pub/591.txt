An Larses was churning once while a tailor watched. When she stepped out for a moment, he noticed a little note on the churn. He took it off and put it in his pocket. When she came back in, the butter poured out of his pockets. That's the way she took butter from the other women in town. When she put the note on, she said, "A spoonful of butter from each woman."
