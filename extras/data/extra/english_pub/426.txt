The person who can walk to a “kongelys” hasn’t been born yet. The light burns where a king’s ransom is buried. Near Svejstrup there’s a kold (a flat area with slopes on three sides) which is called Hjortens kold (The Shepherd’s kold), because that’s where all the sheep that died during the sheep plague are buried. They also say that a light used to burn out there, which the old people have seen, but it disappeared as you got closer. Lights burn over things that are either hidden or secret.
