There was a man in Stenbroen in Tårs, he was called Kristian Stenbroen. That’s south of Borup. Then a woman comes in and wants some milk, they called her Støv-Karen and she live in Støvhuset on the road to Sæsing. Well, says the farmer's wife, she couldn’t today, because they had a cow that had calved, but when she came again, she could have all that she wanted. As soon as she’d left, the calf gets so crazy that it jumped up against the hay rafters and fell down again and made some strange noises and it continued to do this for so long that it finally killed itself. The next morning the man goes down and wants to beat Støv-Karen. But as he comes down to where the poorhouse is now, he meets her, and she was walking along with a staff in her one hand and a milk can in the other. When he gets close to her, she changes herself into a crow and sits on top of her staff and caws at him and the milk can stood beside it. The man got so scared that he ran home and told his wife that as soon as Støv-Karen came again, she was to have everything she wanted. You  see, she’d scared him. My mother was there when that happened with the calf.
