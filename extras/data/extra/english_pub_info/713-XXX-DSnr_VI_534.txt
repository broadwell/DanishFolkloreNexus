On Voldborg eve all of the witches are supposed to ride to Troms church to meet. There was a farmhand who served a woman who was a witch. Now he had heard about this witches’ ride sure enough and therefore decided to watch her that night to see if it really was true that she was going to make this trip. And sure enough, she sneaked out into the barn and smeared one of the horses on all its limbs with a salve which she had in a little pot. He watched carefully where she put the pot down. Then she went and got up on the horse and said: “Here out and here away!” and then the horse took off with her. Then the farmhand took the salve pot and went out and smeared the other horse and got up on it. But he couldn’t really remember what he was supposed to say, and then he said: “Here up and here down!” and immediately it began hopping up and down with him, so that he was about to have his innards rammed to pieces. But then he remembered the right words and said: “Here out and here away!” and immediately the horse took off with him. When he got to the church, he stood outside and saw how the witches’ grandfather sat inside there and poured them wine from a gold horn. When he noticed that they were soon going to be done with their get together, he got up on his horse and took the other one's reins in his hands and said: “Here out and here away!” at which point he took off with both horses, and then he was home before daybreak. But it was several years before his lady (female employer) came back from that trip.
