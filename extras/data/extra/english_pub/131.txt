The witches they churned on Saint Hans eve. One night a girl went and smeared Jens Ilder’s door with that butter because she wanted to bewitch his cattle. But he scraped it off in one place and then he loaded his rifle and shot into it and then he hit the girl and shot her back full of it. Then she had to come to him for a remedy. Well, if she promised to never do that to him or anybody else again, he’d cure her, otherwise she could just stay as she was. Then she had to promise that and then he cured her.
