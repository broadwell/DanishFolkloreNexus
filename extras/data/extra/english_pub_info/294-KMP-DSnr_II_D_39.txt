There were some people who came from Mols and the drove every Saturday morning to Randers with fish. They were supposed to go over Alling river. At times, the water could be well above the bridge, because the bridge was low, and there wasn’t any real run-off for the water. Every now and then people could hear a voice that said, “The time has come but not the man.” One morning a couple of folk from Æbletoft came driving with fish, and it was really dark and murky, so they couldn’t see where they had to drive. Then the water took them. The man died quickly, but the woman screamed pitifully for quite a while, she continued for nearly an entire hour. Her skirts had probably kept her up. Those who lived in Fløvstrup could hear her, since she was carried by the current down there, but they couldn’t find her in time. When they found her body, they said that she’d been stopped by the root of an alder. My mother’s brother cried every time he told me that story.
