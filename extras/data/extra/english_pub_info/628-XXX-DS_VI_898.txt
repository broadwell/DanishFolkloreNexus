There was an old hag who lived down in the Alstrup hills, they called her Skytte-Sofi, and they thought that she could do witchcraft. Then some canvas was stolen from Anders Holmen in Ugilt, and he goes over to her to get her to show it again. She promised to do it too. Then he was supposed to come back the next day, but then it had started raining when he was supposed to go home, and since they had a little building where there was some hay, he went in there and burrowed himself into the hay. Out in the night, the hag comes in and calls a little man to her, and she asks him about this canvas. He doesn't want to tell her. "They hear. They hear." he says, but she had a little switch, and she hit him with that, and then he had to tell her and said that it sat hidden under a slope in a peat pit and a goose feather had been placed to mark where the canvas was. Then the Devil was allowed to go and then when he was gone, Anders Holmen made sure to leave too. He found the canvas at the place where the boy had said it was.
