Minister Fisker in Volstrup had been out conjuring one down, and he came away poorly from that. He had to agree with the Devil that they should race over half a mile. The minister had his coachman along and the wagon and everything, and he jumps up in the wagon, because they were going to drive on top while the Devil was supposed to go under ground. They were to go through an oak thicket and it wasn’t easy for the Devil to tear his way through that. They could hear how the oak roots crackled in the ground, and if they’d been driving on a level field, then the minister would have lost. They drove from the cemetery to a place on the border of the parish between Volstrup and Hørby parish, that was half a mile, and when they get there, the minister was just a fathom ahead of the Devil, and so he beat him. It was a matter of life and death, and the minister drove the two horses so hard that they never really were good for anything again, but if the Devil had won then the minister would have belonged to him.
