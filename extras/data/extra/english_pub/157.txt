There was a man who lived on Knudsholm in Ugilt parish, they called him Iver Holmen or “Long Iver.” He had a large piece of canvas that disappeared one fall. Then he went down to the Bragholdt hag and she was supposed to show the canvas again. When he gets down to her, she’s drunk. She tells him to come the next morning, then she’d tell him where the canvas was. He felt that it was quite a long way from Bragholdt to Knudsholm, and the barn was in bad shape, he could probably get in through one of the walls and hide himself in some hay in there. No sooner thought than done; but it wasn’t too long before the hag came into the barn too and she had a little one with her, she was holding it by the hair in one of her hands and she had a wet dishrag in the other and slapped him with that. He was to tell her where the canvas was. The Devil answered her: “He hears, he hears, he hears!” But the hag was so drunk she didn’t notice he'd said that. Well, she continued slapping him and he said that it lay in the side of a hollow down on the minister’s meadow, that’s where it was hidden. The minister in Ugilt has a meadow on the north side of Holmen’s field. Then the hag and the Devil left and the man went home, he didn’t want the hag to get any money for this. But the following morning a message came for him, he had to go out there and talk to her. She wanted her payment and then he could leave. His canvas was in the place that had been mentioned and he went and got it.
