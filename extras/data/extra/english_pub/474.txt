A farmhand from Rishjarup was over visiting his sweetheart one day, she was in service in Brunde. They were strolling across Egelund field and through Ris woods and they talked about their future and their wedding. But they couldn’t agree on how they should arrange their affairs in the future. The girl says: “You can probably understand, little Hans, that we have to have our wedding soon, given the circumstances I find myself in.” He answered: “I don’t have any money and I can’t support a wife yet.” The result of their conversation was that he said: “I’ll show you that you’re going to have to go by what I want.” At that moment he took a knife out of his pocket and after a fight for life and death he got the upper hand and killed her with fifteen stab wounds. Some passersby found her lying by the side of the road. The next morning, they picked him up at his mother’s who lived here in town and he was decapitated the next year near Nybbøl stockade. That happened in 1802.
