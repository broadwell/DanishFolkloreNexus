Kræn Hyldgård from Årestrup worked down at his brother’s, and they accused him of being half crazy, but he wasn’t so nuts that one. One time he had to go down to Torstedlund and he was going to be flogged since he’d insulted one of the servants down there. When he went in to see the district (birk) judge—it was Knud Tejl—he hawked a huge lungie onto the floor. “You were probably in town before this,” said Tejl. “Yep,” he says, “when I’ve had a dram like I had today, then goddammit I pay no attention to either high or low.” Then the district judge got angry and opened the door and kicked him out, he could go home now. My mother told me that, and she said that if he’d hit him, he wouldn’t have held anything back and would have hit him again.
