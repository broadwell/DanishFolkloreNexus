A girl walked one night along a road. A little ahead of her she saw a shape walking. She thought it looked like her boyfriend, and so she yelled that he should wait, but there was no answer and the shape continued to walk. She walked faster now but it also went faster. Then she yelled and asked him to wait, he usually waited for her and walked with her. Then the shape stopped but when she got there, she noticed it was someone else, who asked if she could say the “Our Father.” She did that, and the shape disappeared. The girl got sick shortly thereafter and died.
