The witches ride on cats on St. Hans Eve to Troms church. In the old days, people were supposed to keep their cats indoors that night, so the witches wouldn’t have them to ride on. I heard tell that they found a cat with a bridle on the next morning, it was ridden to death. A witch who went through the chimney said: “Up and out and no places against.” The girl heard her say that and also wanted to try. She said: “Up and out and everyplace against.” She banged herself to death in the chimney.
