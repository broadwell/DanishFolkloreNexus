Ny-kirke (New church) was supposed to be build in the middle of the parish... Then they began to build it in another place, but that got torn down as well. They started at a third place, but it was the same thing. Finally, they raised two calves on sweet milk until they were a year old, and then they were hitched to a new wagon. The next morning they found them at the current church's location.
