They had a minister in Rold who was called Karmark. He liked to go over to Skjellingbro and get drunk. One night he fell down on the road and remained lying there. Then the post came riding by and couldn’t get by him. He yelled at the figure, “If you’re a human then talk, but if you’re the Devil get out of the way.” The minister didn’t answer because he was sleeping. The the mailman unhitched his rifle and would have shot him, but the rifle clicked three times, and then the minister woke up. Now the mailman believed that the Lord really wanted to spare his life.
     The same minister said, “When the Lord calls, and he says, Per! then I look around and think: Perhaps there’s another one here with the same name. But when he says: Peder Thommesen Karmark! then I have to go.”
