The third one to get hold of a Cyprianus would not be able to get rid of it. There was a smith in Regtrup near Klavsholm, he was called Anders Lyng, and he had gotten it, but unluckily, he was the third, and nothing he did to get rid of it helped. Before he came to Regtrup, he had lived in another town called Matrup, and he had moved to get rid of the Cyprianus. When he'd sold the house, he bound it to a hitching post and left. But when he got to Regtrup, it was lying on the table in his new house. When he saw it, he got so angry, that he went to the smith and started the fire and then he put it in the fire, and it seemed to him that it was burned to ashes. But when he came into his living room, he found it on the table once again. From that time on, he had bad luck with him all the time.
