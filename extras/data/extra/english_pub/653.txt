Maren Plovmand from Tustrup mark tells the following story: My brother Niels and another farmhand, who was called Per, were supposed to drive swine out to the beechnuts in Løvenholms forest in the fall. They were riding and when they had gotten the swine out to their place, they wanted to get some hazel switches to take home to use to make baskets. So they cut a good many switches and bound them together with a thin piece of hazel, lay one across each one of the horses and rode back. They had these shaggy caps on with stiff shades that stuck out and a copper rim on both the hat and the brim. As they are riding along, Niels says: "Your hat is on fire, Per." -- "I don't get that." he says and looks around. "But your beard and hair are also on fire." Then Niels says, "Your whip is on fire too." -- "No matter. I am not letting them go until I have to. Let us say the Lord's Prayer." They did that, but it didn't help, and now they rode silently along, quite afraid. They saw this as a punishment for having stolen the switches. Finally they came to Nörager. There is a little stream there that they had to cross, and as they ride over it, Niels looks back and he sees a glowing wheel, spinning away from the stream and along the road they had come on. After that, everything was over, and they came home well to Tustrup. Niels didn't want to go in and went immediately to bed in the farmhands' room. But Per wanted to go in and get something to eat. He got sick and didn't sleep at all that night, but Niels slept well.
