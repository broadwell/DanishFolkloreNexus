In Bræsten and Skibet there was not more than a single person alive after the plague in each parish, and it was a young man and a little girl. There was forest over practically the entire area, and they had a hard time finding each other. So they rang the church bells, he the one in Bræsten and she the one in Skibet and they went after the sound. He found her on top of a high hill where she sat crying, and that hill is still called Crying hill (Grædebjærg). Others say that they met each other on a hill between Vilstrup and Ruu which is called Glass mountain (Glasbjærg). They got married and it is said that the area’s population descends from them.
