Until just a few years ago, there was a large stone out in Nørre-Lem heath that was called Simon's stone, and it was said to have been thrown there by a troll over on the Tylland side who wanted to knock Rødding church down, but it was too heavy for him and it fell out in the heath. After a while, people cleaved pieces off of it and took them away, and when Bustrup barn burned down after a lightning strike a few years ago, the rest of the stone was bought by the owner of Bustrup and brought back to the farm and used to rebuild the barn. It was a good thirty loads. You could see the marks of the troll's fingers in the stone.
