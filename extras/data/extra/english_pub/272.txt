My great grandfather’s wife had gotten so sick, so sick and he went to the cunning man, she was so bad off when he left that she was screaming. Then when he got to the man, he asked how she was. And he said, that since that afternoon at 2pm, your wife hasn’t had anything wrong with her. Then the man went home and believed that she was dead now. And he came into the living room and she shouted from the bedroom. “Is that you Rasmus? You don’t need to walk to softly, since I’ve more or less gotten better. Since 2 this afternoon, nothing has been wrong with me.” Then the man realized that what the cunning man had said was right. But the man could never figure out how that could have been.
