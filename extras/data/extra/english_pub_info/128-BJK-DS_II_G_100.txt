Two farmhands were out on the heath digging peat. Then one of them fell asleep and a white mouse came out of his mouth and ran over to a channel where it ran and tumbled. The other one put his peat spade over the channel and then the mouse ran over the spade and into the ground on the other side. A little later it came back and ran once again into the farmhand’s mouth. Then he woke up. “I’ll bet you had a dream.”--“Yes.”--“What did you dream?” -- “I dreamed that there was a kettle of money in that hill.” -- “Well, we should get ahold of them, let’s go dig for them right now.” -- “Ah, to hell with that,” says the farmhand who’d been sleeping. “Well, I’m going to dig.” He found the kettle too, and it was also filled with money. Then he told the other farmhand what had happened.
