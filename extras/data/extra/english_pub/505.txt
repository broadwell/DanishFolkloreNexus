SÃ¸ren Tind had to go fetch the doctor for his landlord once. That was all the way in Randers. When he got to Fladbro, a big dog fell in with him and followed along with him for a little bit of the way, but then it went on past him. It had eyes that were so big they were like fire. He was so sick when he got to Randers, that he thought that he smashed up all of his guts.
