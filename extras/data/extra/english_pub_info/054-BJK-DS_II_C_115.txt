A man had driven a load of heather over here which they’d gathered over in the hills. When they were going to carry it in at night, the night raven came and scared my mother, and she ran inside defenseless. 
     One time over at Gravlev inn, a large group of youngsters had gathered. Then there was one called Jokum, he called for the night raven and said “ba-u” just like it. But then it came after them out on the street and they ran into the inn and wanted to hide. Jokum had said, “What kind of a guy says ba-u?” and after that they’d called it Jokum’s guy. Well, then the night raven flew away again, but Jokum didn’t dare come out of the inn, he was the last one there that night.
