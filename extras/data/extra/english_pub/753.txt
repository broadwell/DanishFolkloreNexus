A man who was in need of fodder had a nisse, but it was one of those young nisser, who hadn’t really learned that much yet. He and the farmhand were good friends and would accompany each other all the time. Then one time they were to go steal fodder and they came to a barn. The nisse took far beyond all measure and then they left. After they had gone a little ways, the farm hand says: “Shouldn’t we take a rest?” What’s that? Well, he’d show him, and then he sat down. After they’d sat a while, the nisse says that if he’d known that there was something called to take a rest, then he’d have brought back to the farm everything that was in the barn.
