A mound dweller’s wife came running with her dough-covered hands and a peel-board that was broken out of Bavnhøj here on Årestrup field and went up to man who was plowing there. He repaired it too with a nail which he took out of his plow axe, and he now got a piece of a flatbread when she’d baked, and some beer too. He made a cross over it and read the Lord’s prayer, before he took it, but then the woman came and said he didn’t have to do that since it was made of the same things as his.
