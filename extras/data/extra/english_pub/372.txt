There was a girl who had a stepmother and she was really mean to her. She often went for walks out in the woods. Every day, a cat comes up to her out there and he says to her one day that she can climb up onto his back and come home with him. She does that too. Then he asks her if she can see anything? Yes, she could see a big castle. Thatâ€™s where his parents lived, he said, because he was bewitched, there was a woman who had changed him into a tom cat that had to walk about in the woods.
