In Ry mill there was once a miller’s wife who hanged herself. Why she did it, no one knew, but everyone knew that she walked again. Often it sounded like all of the grinding mills had been started all at once in the middle of the night. Then when the miller’s apprentice came up to check, everything was quiet. Soon she carried out her nightly spooking with the beds. She pulled the comforters off of the people who lay in them. Yes, it got so bad, that they saw her at lunchtime at the table, where she served food to the people as she used to while she was alive. But as soon as someone talked about her, when she was visible in one place or another, she disappeared. Finally, according to what they say, she was conjured down in the river, under the mill bridge. An old man, who worked for her as a farmhand while she was alive later told the following: Seven years after the miller’s wife hanged herself, I was lying in my bed at home and was wide awake. Then I heard something that was rustling across the floor and all of a sudden there was a chalk white shape standing by my bed and it smiled at me. I didn’t get scared at all, even though I could see who it was. “Yes,” she says, “You can certainly believe that I’ve had a terribly hard time since I died, but now I’m fine, so fine. I left here seven years too early and I’ve had to suffer terribly because of that.” “God almighty,” I yelled, “Can I shake your hand. Oh God, how you make me happy.” But then she smiled at me again, waved to me with her right hand and then she was gone.
