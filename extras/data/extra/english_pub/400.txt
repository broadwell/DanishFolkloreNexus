There was a woman who was quite stingy towards her workers. She lived near a church and had the church key. She had the habit of going into the church every Saturday evening to say all of her prayers for the whole week. Now she had gotten a new farmhand in November, and he wondered how he could teach her to give them better food. He had noticed her church-going and so he thought, “I'll trick her there.” One Saturday evening he’s in good enough time to get into the church before her and he sits down behind the altar. The old hag comes in and falls down onto the kneeler, spreads her hands out and says: “Oh, how well one lives.”  “Yes, the devil feeds your body.” Now she gets a little hot around the ears, since she thought that it was someone from the other world. “Why do you say that, dear sir?” “Because you give your workers so little to eat.” “Oh, I'll improve myself.” “Well then I'll be merciful.” -- “But you see, I'm keeping all of that for my God.” -- “Well, otherwise the little-one [Satan] will tear out both your eyes.” Then she hurried out of the church, as fast as reins and bridle could hold. Since that time, she went to church along with other people, and her workers received fare like at the other farms.
