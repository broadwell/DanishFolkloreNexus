My father told a story that there were once two hags who pulled off their clothes and climbed through a horse skin they’d hung up on a pole. They were pregnant and they were naked and then their babies became werewolves. But they were people most of the time. When they were wolves, they’d tear apart the first thing they encountered regardless of what it was. A farmhand at home here drove out on the heath with a girl and they were boyfriend and girlfriend. When they get to a dale or a low place out there on the heath, the farmhand gets down and says to the girl: “If a wolf comes up to you, don’t stick it with the pitchfork.” -- “Well, what should I do with it then?” Well, she could pull off her apron and hit it with that. As soon as he’d gone, a wolf comes up to her and it wanted to jump on her. But she grabbed her apron and hit it. It snapped at it and tore it into tiny pieces, and then it ran away. A little later, the farmhand comes back. “A wolf was just here and wanted to tear me apart, and you were gone for so long.” He laughed a bit about that. Her apron was blue with some white stripes. When the farmhand began to laugh, she could see the threads between his teeth. “It was you,” she says, “because I can see the threads between your teeth.” Then he never became a werewolf again, because now he’d been revealed.
