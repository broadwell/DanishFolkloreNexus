There was a gaardbo in Stempegaard in Børglum parish—it was in one of the two farms that had that name, and he had a red cow he was supposed to take care of, and he procured food for it. Now there was a condition that he was to have sweet porridge with butter in it every evening and he got this for many years. But then one evening the farm wife wanted to play a little trick on him and so she put the butter on the bottom of the bowl and the porridge on top of it. Well, the gaardbo gets so angry that there wasn’t butter in the porridge and he goes out into the cow barn and kills the red cow. Then he goes back inside and is delighted with what he’s done. But when he’d eaten the porridge, he finds the butter at the bottom of the bowl and he now regrets what he’s done. Now he knew that over in Vollerup—that’s what those places north in Em parish are called—there was a red cow there exactly like the one that he’d killed. Then he puts the dead cow up on his shoulders and went over the heath that’s called Skrølløs heath between Stenbæk farm and Vollerup, it was filled with stones and other junk. He pulls the live cow out and carries the dead cow in and puts it in place of the other one, and then he went back again to Stempegaard with the cow and put it in the barn. The next day he went and talked with himself, “Oh, yeah, Skrølløs heath was long, and the red cow heavy, oh my back, I carried it.” He went and complained, his back really hurt, and he went about whining.
