It was a common belief that when the witches were on their way to Troms church, that they could go in through the bell bays in each and every church they went past, and they’d sit and rest on the bells. Then there was one called Find, and another called Rind, and they were going to visit each other. They met at a church, which was named but I can’t remember it. Then one says to the other, “I came from Troms church to here without eating.” The other one was supposed to have brought food for him, but he didn’t have it. They talked a bit more together but I don’t remember what it was.
