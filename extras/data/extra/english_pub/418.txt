There’s a legend about Mos lake, it's supposed to disappear and become a little stream, and then it's supposed to become a lake again. When that’s happened, that Mos lake stream has become a lake again, the Turk will water his cattle there. And as soon as the wet ells have become large forests, then the world won’t have much time. There are wet ells near where I live.
