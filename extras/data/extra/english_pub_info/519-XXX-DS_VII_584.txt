In Ajstrup near Brønderslev there was a witch who took a man's milk by milking through her garters. Since the witch often ran about the farm in the shape of a hare, Hals Præst gave them the advice that it should be shot with a silver button. Then one evening the hare was shot so that it dragged one of its legs behind it and the next day the witch was bed-ridden and had broken her thigh. She said she'd fallen down out by the well.
