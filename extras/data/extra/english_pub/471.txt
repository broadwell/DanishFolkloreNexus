One evening, ten or so girls were walking home from the carding house, and then they had to cross Borup stream. Now, they new ahead of time that the bridge had washed out, and they went and discussed this: "If only there's a horse standing down there that will ride us over the stream." And when they got down there, a big black horse was standing in the water. Then they got up on it, one after the other, and there was still room for more. Then the first one looked back and said, "Jesus Christ's cross, 
what a long horse!" 
Then the horse threw them all into the stream and disappeared.
