The first workers who came to Konradsminde glassworks were Norwegians. Germans came later. The Norwegians were otherwise neat folk in appearance. They came once in a while in to Ersted to buy butter. Old Truukræn didn’t think much of their visits, but he was a bit crazy by the end. About Kold-Jens’s stepmother he said: It’s strange that Kjæsten will have these Norwegians in her house, those shits, there was one of them who poked his head out and said to me, “I think your clothes are so ragged. Just because you’re old doesn’t mean you have to have such ragged clothes.” But I chewed that guy out and said, “You’ve barely got a shirt that you can wear on your back.” Then he pulled his goddamn head back inside.
