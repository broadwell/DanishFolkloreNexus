Big Lavst in Svejstrup had a sick pig. He went about down in the peat bogs and was incredibly dirty. Then he came to Peder Johansen. “I can only give you one piece of advice and, if that doesn’t help, I don’t know what else to do. You need to buy four shillings worth of green soap, and wash yourself with it and give the pig the water.” The pig died, but Lavst got washed clean. Now he was teased by everybody out on the moor since they hadn’t seen him that clean since he got married.
