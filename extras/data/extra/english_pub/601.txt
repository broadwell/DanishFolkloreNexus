A farmhand and a girl got engaged once. The farmhand journeyed off abroad in the meantime, after promising his beloved that he would come and get her on a specific day. He died before then, but she knew nothing about it. Finally, the day came, and he came riding up too, and she followed happily along with him. She sat in front up on the horse and he was behind her, and now they went at a fast trot through unknown areas. It was a beautiful clear moonlit night that night so they could see their shadows on the ground, and the dead one sang, 
"The moon shines brightly, 
the dead ride upright, 
aren't you scared my little girl?" 
He had certainly seemed strange to her on the trip, but she answered, "Why should I be afraid when I am with you?" After they had ridden for a while, they came to a cemetery, and he got off the horse there and disappeared. Later, she discovered that he was dead and buried.
