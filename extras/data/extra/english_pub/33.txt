There was a farm in Madum Sø, which sank and it was called Freggelund … slaughtered a pig … left his book on a chair and then wanted to go off and give the last sacrament to the sick person, but a splash of water appeared right in the middle of living room floor, and then he says to his driver that he should turn around and get out of there as fast as they could, because now the farm would sink. They got up in the wagon and left and when they got off the property, the farm had sunk. The minister had forgotten his book on the chair but it came sailing ashore with the book on it.
