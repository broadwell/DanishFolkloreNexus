Karl Pølse (Karl Sausage) robbed a lot along the beach. He lured the ships ashore by lighting a fire up in the tower room when it was bad weather. They mistook this for Skagen's light and, in that manner, many ships ran aground off of Hirtshals. In the daytime, Karl Pølse would go to the beach to see if there were any stranded people and, if there were, he took whatever valuables he found and killed the people. One time a ship stranded, and a man had come ashore from it with a chest. The man appeared to be a clergyman. When Karl noticed that the stranger was taking great care of the chest, he assumed that there was gold or the like inside it. He killed him and took the chest home in order to break it open. When he got it opened, there was only a copper chain link in it. But Karl Pølse believed that there was gold inside it and the smith had to file on it, but it didn’t help at all, since it was copper and remained copper. Karl Pølse got so mad at this that he took the link and tossed it out into the pit. But for him, it was just like the chain link bound him, so he couldn’t do anything. He sent for minister Mads from Horne, who also came out there and got Karl released from the chain link, but he had to build a chapel for the sin he’d committed, and that’s the current Asdal church. In addition, Mr. Mads found out that the chain link was the same one that St. Peter had been chained in. Mr. Mads forbade Karl Pølse from robbing at the beach anymore, maybe so that he could get more for himself. Karl continued anyways, but then the tower burned down one night, since the fire had been built too big in the tower room. When Mr. Mads heard that, he went out to Karl Pølse and told him that it was a punishment from heaven.
