In the olden days there was a man in Bjerre province whose field ran right up to a black hill in which a mound dweller lived. The man knew this well and one day he plowed close to it, there was a peel board on top of the hill, and it was broken. So he tightly fastened the shaft with a wedge and put the peel board down again. The mound dweller was baking, and later that afternoon, when he came out to plow again, there was a little cake lying in the same place for him. He was to have it because he had repaired the peel board.
