A girl once got a ride from the rogue from Mjels. Then he started talking to her and asked her if she knew the guy that they called the rogue from Mjels. No, but she’d heard about him, and he’d neither hurt nor helped her, and she started to tell him what she’d heard. Then he drove right out into the middle of the Mjels ford, and said, “Now you can get down and say: The rogue has both helped me and hurt me, because now I’ve given you a ride and now you can go wading.”
