Holger Danske sits in a mound somewhere. My mother said that he sat out in a giant mound in Lovns parish, and there were all sorts of entrances and passages down to him. Every year, they are supposed to give him their hand, because he wants to feel if there is still power in the Danish blood, and then they reach a steel pole down to him, they don't dare reach a hand down. He is supposed to come up and fight for Denmark one more time.
