In a cemetery here in Vendsyssel, a grave digger was digging a grave and he finds a body that was rotten but the head was intact. When he throws it up to the other bones, it rattles and there was lead in the ears. Then this gets reported to the parish bailiff and he figures out that a horse seller had come to the inn one night and had died suddenly the next morning after which he’d been buried in the cemetery and this had to be his body. It turned out that the innkeeper, who was a widow, had killed him and gotten four hundred daler by doing so. She wasn’t dead yet and had to admit her deed. She’d gotten her daughter to help her pour the lead into his ears. The old woman was executed and her daughter was put in jail for the rest of her life.
