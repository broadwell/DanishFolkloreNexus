A light is seen burning occasionally somewhere out in the field, and there is some sort of treasure hidden out there they say. It’s bad to harm such a light if you happen upon it. There was this forester who saw such a light out in Nordtorpe—a forest east of Kvændrup town—and he went over to it and swung at it with his staff, but then he couldn’t get away from there again. When he got free, his mouth was pulled askew up under one ear, and it was a long time before he was back to his normal self.
