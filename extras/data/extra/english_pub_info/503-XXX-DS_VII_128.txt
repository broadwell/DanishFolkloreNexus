Ane Husted up here could also do witchcraft and turn herself into a hare. She went out on people's fields at night and in their stalls and in their kitchens. But she finally met her bane because of that. They shot at her many times, but it never bit. Finally they shot the hare lame in one of its back legs, and then Ane Husted got really hurt in one of her legs, and lay for quite a while before she died. They finally got fire under her at last, and it is fourteen or fifteen years since she died. She had her money in stockings and pots that were buried in the kitchen.
