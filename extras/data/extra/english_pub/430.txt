The parish clerk in Mjessing used to eat his lunch in the weapon house while he was ringing to the service. The bells were to be rung three times. Then the parsonage’s chickens had found their way in to him and he sat there and gave them crumbs from his sandwich. But one day the minister came in to hurry him up, he was to go in and ring. But now the chickens were in the weapon house and he didn’t think it looked so good having them walking about in there. So he takes his felt hat and starts swinging it about to get them out with some finality, but he’s unlucky enough to hit the rooster so it falls over. So that there won’t be anymore accidents he takes it and puts it in his pocket and goes out to ring to assembly. He goes in again and gets the minister into his garb and does his duty with the songs and gets the minister into his vestments and takes care of his duties with the song and gets the minister up to the pulpit, and he doesn’t remember the rooster. Like most parish clerks, he sat down and started sleeping. But a little later, the rooster comes to life, flies out of his pocket and looks around a bit. Then it takes the straightest path up to the altar and starts crowing its best. The minister would usually raise his voice near the end so the parish clerk would wake up and that happens too, the parish clerk wakes up and he thinks it's the minister and so he says "Amen."
