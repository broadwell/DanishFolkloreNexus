Margrete is now in her 82nd year and had gone and picked up after the men during the harvest for 7 half and three whole days and then 1 day another place with potatoes and beets for several days. Hadnâ€™t been sick since she was seven years old until the time she had influenza (78 years old), except for once she had some cold shivers a few times.
