A woman in Holev in Fyn tells the following story: “When I was a child when I was driving at dusk with my father’s brother on the road between Rynkeby and Revninge. Just as we’re driving along, the horses stop dead in their tracks and wouldn’t take another step; my uncle whipped them but that didn’t help, we didn’t move, we stopped there for about half an hour. Then uncle jumped quickly off the wagon, went around to the horses and made a spark, then he got back up into the wagon and then the horse could go and ever since then nothing has ever gone wrong whenever we drive past that place. One night, me and uncle came walking along the same road and when we came to the place where the horses wouldn’t continue, I saw that there was a tall shape without a head in a grayish white cape right in front of us on the road. I nudged uncle and said to him quietly: “What’s that?” He said: “Be quiet, I see that shape every night I walk here, but that kind of thing doesn’t do anything when we mind our own business.” It was that shape that had met the horses so they couldn’t go forward but we couldn’t see it so early at night.
