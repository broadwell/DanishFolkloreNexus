A man was walking through a forest and a beautiful woman came up to him without him knowing from where. She was so beautiful, he'd never seen her equal. It was just about midday, and since the man had heard stories about elves, he didn't doubt that she must be an elf. She spoke nicely to him and tried to lure him into the woods, but the man was too smart for her, and finally he said: "Turn around and let me see if you are the same in the back as you are in the front." When she heard that, she went her way, and he saw that she was as hollow as a dough trough.
