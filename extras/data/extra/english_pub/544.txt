One night a farmhand who worked at Kragelund had gone away from home. When he got back, he looked into the courtyard and saw lots of wagons, but it lasted only a moment, and then everything was gone again. A little while later, the man who the farmhand worked for died. He saw something like that at another place he worked and someone at the farm died shortly afterward too.
