A hawthorn bush is supposed to grow up out of Viborg Lake, and the Danish king is supposed to tie his horse to it when he cannot manage himself any longer, and then he is to go into the lake and drown himself. They say that the bush has grown up. The enemies are supposed to be the Germans. But Denmark is supposed to win the battle at last with twelve-year-old boys and sixty-year-old men, all of the others in between are supposed to have been killed.
