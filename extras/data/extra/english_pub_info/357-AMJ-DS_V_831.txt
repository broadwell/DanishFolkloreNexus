An old man who was called Lars Nielsen, he’d hung himself down in a little woods which was called Hjørre, then he was supposed to be buried in a stone wall, which was the practice in those days. But then the minister went in to him with two men, who were supposed to be witnesses, and he asked him three questions. He answered all three of them and they say that the men heard that he gave correct answers as if he were alive. When the minister went back in to the wife, because she couldn’t be in there with the corpse, then he says, “You’re the one to blame, if you and I were so certain about Heaven as he is, then it would be no matter.” He wasn’t so sure himself about getting to Heaven since he did so much magic. Then he wrote to Copenhagen about this, and so he was the first one around here that had hung himself that came into consecrated ground, but without any songs and ringing.
