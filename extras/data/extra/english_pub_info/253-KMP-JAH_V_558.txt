Out to the west by a mill there was a gypsy who had fallen in love with the miller’s daughter, and she ran off to the country with him. She could have inherited the mill if she’d left him alone, but now her parents disinherited her. They stopped getting along and often quarreled. One day he came to my father’s place near Rude church, and then he says to my mother, “Have you seen Gertrude, mother?” – “No, I haven’t.” – “She’s gone her way, she’s taken all of our possessions, she’s taken the backpack, she’s taken the side bag, and she’s even taken the handbag, mother!” and then he cried. Several days later he came by with Gertrude, as happy as can be, now that they’d made up. My great grandmother cried for that poor woman when she came by there.
