Madam Ribert in Nanderup killed her driver and tossed his body in a water hole out in the swamp. There is still a stone down there which one can slide up and down; but it has never been taken up. Old Buchwalt wanted to get it up, but Laust Ladefoged said no, it wouldn’t turn out well for him, and so he let it be, and nobody has touched it since. She had also killed a little child out in the barn, they claimed, and they believed that she had hidden it in that stone like a chest and then got the driver to drive it out to the swamp, but since she was afraid that he couldn’t keep her secret, she pushed him backwards into the water hole and drove him down. I’ve gone in the swamp and speared pike and run across that stone many many times; it sounds so hollow. It’s just a little east of Nanderup in Jærnkilde. Every seventh year she comes driving through the barn and then out and about and down along the farm. Then all of the doors spring open. They heard it not too long ago. She was conjured down near Vilsund, and she raced the minister to the sound, him above ground and her under ground, but he came too late and said: “If it hadn’t been Bjærgby sand and Sundby clay, I probably could have taken care of myself.”
