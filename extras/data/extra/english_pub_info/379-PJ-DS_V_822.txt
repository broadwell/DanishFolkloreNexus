While Pastor Fæster was minister in Svejstrup, there was a man who killed himself there at the farm, and it was during the summer so he was placed in the barn. One afternoon a farmhand had gone into the barn to take his afternoon nap and then the minister went in there too and goes over to the dead person whom he wakes up. He sits up on his behind and answers the minister’s questions. The farmhand who was lying in there became so wretched that he never really was much of a person after having seen that sight.
