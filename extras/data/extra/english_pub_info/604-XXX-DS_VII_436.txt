A woman was a witch and one time she was supposed to go to Troms church. Then she took a stick and a bottle, rubbed the shaft with what was in the bottle, and said, "Up and out!" The shaft immediately flew up the chimney and continued on with her. The girl had noticed what the woman had done, and she took another stick, rubbed it and got up on it to ride. But then she said, "Up and down!" Then it went straight up to the tippy top of the chimney and then down again, and it kept going up and down like that until the woman came back.
