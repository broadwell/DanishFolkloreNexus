In the old days, there was one who had hung himself in Rold forest. The boys went and worked as shepherds just like in other places, and then they wanted to try hanging themselves. The one who was up hanging, the others were supposed to help down. But they made an agreement with him, that they weren't supposed to let him down until he'd made his water. So, three had been up hanging, but when the fourth was up hanging, a rooster comes by, pulling a large load of hay. All of the others fell down in amazement at that sight, and they forgot to get him down, and so he hung and died.
