There was a revenant at a manor farm that would never leave people alone. One evening, a poor man came and asked for lodgings. No, that wasn't possible, since that night a whole group of ministers were going to gather there. He said that he could perhaps be of service, and so they gave him a little room and a thin little candle. The ministers sat each one in their own room with a large candle and books in front of them. He sat down by the fireplace with the candle in front of him and he put a little book on the mantle piece. Then he took a little knife and a stick out of his pocket, whittled a shaving and threw it into the fire, and said, "Now he is getting up." With the next piece: "Now he is at the cemetery gate." Next: "Now he is at the gate." With that they heard the dogs howl, and then the door flew open and the revenant raced from room to room like a wind and blew out the ministers' candles and left them in the dark. But he couldn't blow out the beggar's candle. Then he began to read. Etc.
