Over in Jutland there lived a man who could drive out both rats and mice and since Samsingerne was plagued with those kind of things, he was sent for and asked if he couldn’t come and practice his art. Sure enough he’d do that, but to protect himself against a lindorm, if one was to be found over there, he requested that a big bonfire be lit and kept burning as well as a strong horse be kept saddled and ready. The man now began his sport; but then a lindorm came at him from over in Lindholm. He got up on the horse and when the lindorm was close to him he rode right through the fire. As soon as the lindorm saw that, it followed in quick pursuit. He repeated this so many times that finally the lindorm got burned and died from that. The next year the man came over here again and he wanted to go and see the place where he’d defeated the lindorm; but while he went and kicked at the pieces of it, he got a bone splinter in his foot, and died from that. 
     There is an old saying that the person who kills a lindorm may not come back to the place where the killing took place because that will cost him his life.
