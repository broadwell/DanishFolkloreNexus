I was down to see the cunning woman in Vindbl√¶s to have some coins that had gone missing for a man here in Gjedsted shown again. But she wouldn't and she showed me the door. "Well, little madam, please excuse me but..." I began again and wanted to tell her a bit more. But she interrupted me immediately, "No, I don't want to fight the Devil twenty-four times for two hours each time over such a little thing. Sure my father did it, and I have the same books that my father had, but I don't want to have anything to do with that."
