There was a farmer who lived in Dybb√∏l, who every evening would leave a bowl of porridge out on the mill stone for a little nisse who lived there at the farm. One evening, the girl had put the porridge on top and the butter on the bottom... Nothing else to do than to find a cow that was exactly like the one he'd killed. But it wasn't that easy to find, and he first found one way up in Als. Nonetheless, he managed to have everything arranged by the next morning. When the girl was to water the cows, it couldn't find its stall. She got mad about that and hit the cow. Then the little nis came and said, "You mustn't hit it, because it isn't used to this," and with that he had to tell the girl everything.
