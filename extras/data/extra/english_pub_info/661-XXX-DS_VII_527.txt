There was a full witch in Hundslev near Kjerteminde. One time, a girl came to her who she was to cure of a disease and she did that too. When the girl had been cured, the witch asked her if she didn't want to learn witchcraft, to which the girl answered yes. The witch then came with a hare's head on a platter and the girl was to kiss it, otherwise she couldn't become a witch. But even though the hare's head was detached from its body, it stared at her so horribly that the girl didn't dare kiss it, and so it didn't amount to anything with her becoming a witch. 
      In contrast, the witch had a daughter who learned the craft from her mother. They had small children at one of the places where the girl worked, and they were being pulled in a wagon across the floor. Then the girl, who was a witch, said that she could make the wagon go by itself. Then the ones who were pulling it let go and then the wagon drove back and forth on the floor. Finally, it came really fast and the girl who had started it going couldn't stop it again; she got scared and ran home to her mother in Hundslev and the wagon didn't stop until she got home. 
      The old witch went out walking once on Hindsholm near Hverringe manor, and she was accompanied by a farmhand. Next to the road where the witch and the farmhand were walking were the manor's fields where they were plowing with seven plows. The witch now says to the farmhand that she could make all seven plows stand still all at once. The farmhand thought that that was impossible, but at that moment, six of the plows stood still, the seventh, by contrast, continued to plow. The farmhand asked why the one kept plowing. The witch answered, "That's because there's flying rowan in it, and so I don't have any power over it."
