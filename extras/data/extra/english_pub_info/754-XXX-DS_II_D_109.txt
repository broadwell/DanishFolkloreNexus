A man had been to the inn one fall evening and he went home afterward. Then there was an old horse walking in front of him. "Can't you wait a bit, we could walk together?" The horse doesn't answer, of course, but it did slow down. "That was good, that you could give yourself some time, perhaps you could help me, I have a lot to carry. Things are pretty bad tonight, and so you can carry my package and me too." Then he jumped up on the horse and rode into town. When they got to the cemetery, the horse became as big as a house, and the man wound up hanging onto the upper most branch of one of the big trees there are around the cemetery, then he had to get down from there however he could. He crawled down, but it hurt.
