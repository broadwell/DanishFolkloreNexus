My stepmother served at Anders Væver’s farm in Egaa for fourteen years. There was a nisse who lived in a hollow ash tree in the commons, and he went and fed both the horses and the cows. She was herself born on Christmas morning, and so she could see him. She often saw him in the alley when he had to go get water, and he said to her that she shouldn’t be afraid of him because he wouldn’t hurt her. Anders Væver said to some other men that he’d make a large bet with them that they couldn’t steal any apples from his garden. So they tried it. Some were supposed to go up into the apple tree and shake it, and the others would pick them up. But then a big animal came which looked like a fox and pushed them all to the side and all of these roosters appeared and fluttered about the people who were up in the tree so they didn’t get any apples, and that was because of the nisse. This Anders Væver sat at the head of the table after he’d died and counted his money, and it sounded like sacks were being dragged about in the attic since he’d probably committed a crime by not measuring properly. Most of the animals died, and if the son hadn’t dragged the rest to Løgten and sold them there, then they all would have died. He had three children and one son, but they ended up so bad off all of them. The son was miserable with cancer that ate right through his entire throat. The children were quite rich at the start and had had enough money.
