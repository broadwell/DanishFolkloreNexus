In Rongenbjærg in Tyrskind my father noticed some weird happenings. Many times when he had been lying out there at night or early in the morning and grazed the horses, he heard chests being slammed shut inside it (the mound). Immediately, the horses reared up and jumped about and snorted in their bridles. Midways up the hill we dug for marl, we discovered a black hall which didn’t end on the other side, and we found a little ball of yarn that time. We thought that that was weird. Deep holes had been dug in the mounds and the Poles had put their horses in them when they were here.
