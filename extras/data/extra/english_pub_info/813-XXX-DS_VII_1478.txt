It was old Mads Jensen in Risby, he was riding along the road once. Then there was someone who shot at him, and he was hit too, but the bullet went through his sweater and nightshirt. Then he took it, and rode back with it to the man who had shot and said, "Don't trouble yourself with shooting at me any more." The man was utterly surprised when he got his bullet back. But Rasmus Jensen had been born in a victory shirt, and he had kept it.
