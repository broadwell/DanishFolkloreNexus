Several years ago in Kragelund, a woman hung herself in a sheep pen. At that time, there was a minister in the parish named Ermandinger. After she had been buried, the minister decided that he wanted to conjure her up to find out how she was doing. So he went out and conjured her up, and she appeared like a black spirit up above him. To the question how she was doing, she answered that she was doing fine as long as it wasnâ€™t fear of Judgment Day.
