Here in the northern towns there was a hag, she smeared her oven rake and rode on it. She’d dressed up a bundle of straw to look like her and laid it beside her husband while she was gone. There was a beggar sleeping out in their scullery and he heard what she said to the oven rake and saw how she smeared it from a jar and how she put it back. When she said, “No places against but with every place, and up out of the chimney to Troms church in Norway,” then she flew away. Then the beggar went over and took the jar and then he smeared his staff. But the beggar had so utterly misheard what she had said that he said, “Against all places and without every place and up out of the chimney to Hasseris in Jutland.” He was from there and it just came out of his mouth. Then he got up on the staff and then every place flew at him and he finally came out of the chimney totally beaten up and over to Hasseris, where it threw him into a dung pool. He could truly say that he’d come up to ride with his brother-in-law.
