There was a man in Blegind, he went over to the minister's many nights and stole some of the good apples they had there. They noticed that somebody was taking them and then the farm hand asks the minister if he shouldn't sit guard and see who it was. “That isn't really necessary, because by the time you wake up tomorrow morning, then you can go out and see who it is.” When the people got up the next morning and went out in the yard, one of the townsmen was sitting up in the tree and had a sack in one hand and in it was a single apple so that one could see what it was that he was out after and he was holding on to the tree with the other hand. Then people tried to help him down but they couldn't. When the minister came he said, “It's sad that you aren't smarter than to occupy yourself with something like this,” and then he could come down.
