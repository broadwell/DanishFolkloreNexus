My grandfather said that at a farm in Nielstrup—it was in fact the one where there’d been things—they always had bad luck with their animals. Then they sought out a cunning man and he said to the man: “You should look in your parlor, there’s a hole in the floor, and where the hole is, you should dig down and find a kettle of money. But you can’t stay at your farm that night.” The man answered and said that it would never happen that he’d dig for it. But their son, he believed nevertheless that his parents had dug for it, because they wound up having a lot of money, and it was quiet at the farm. But he never really found out what had happened. That farmhand said--and he told this as it were true--that some times when things were bad there it was like the horses could stand and sweat and when he went up and fixed their manger, it looked like as if there were small piglets lying there, and he carried them out to the mud pool, but in the morning it was good straw that he'd carried out.
