A revenant once walked in Hummelgård thicket. The minister met him out there one night, and then they agreed that the one who got to Krejbjærg church first had won. The minister had to go over land and the revenant underground. Then it hit its head on a large rock down there underground, and it took a while to get going again, since it had to go around it. Then the minister reached the church first, but when the other one was so close that he grabbed his back wheel when they got to the church.
