There’s a mound on Borup field in Taars, where ten or twelve shepherds met one day and sat and talked, because the fields weren’t separated at that time, and so they drove their sheep together. Then there was a girl, she sat in the middle of a hole in the mound and had a gray scarf over her head. My mother was along and said later that it was the daughter of a cotter; she also said whose daughter it was. Then there’s shouting down in the mound, and the shepherds all heard it, because my mother talked about this often: “Hey, take the big skimming spoon and chase the silly gray girl from the smoke hole.” Then all of a sudden it was as if she’d been hit with skimmed fat from her head to her toe. Then they got out of there in a hurry and from that day on the shepherds never went up on that mound again.
