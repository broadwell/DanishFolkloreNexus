There was a farmhand who couldn’t pronounce the letter “l”. My mother was over there sewing. There was going to be a wedding in the neighborhood, and she asked him if he was going to attend. “No, I can’t go over there before this evening, then I’m supposed to go up there with the sour cheese, since I don’t have anything to wear on my feet other than my cwogs” He meant his wooden clogs. They served sour cheese on platters at that time at banquets. It was eaten along with good beer. Another time he said, “It was a good birth banquet, they got rice gruel and skrod, and apple dumplings afterward.”
