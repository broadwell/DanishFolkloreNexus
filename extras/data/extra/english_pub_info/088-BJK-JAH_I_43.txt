The town herdsman in Årestrup was named Båjj-Måtten, and he walked about in the morning yelling and making noise and blowing his horn, and those people who didn’t manage to get their head of cattle out early enough had to drive them out afterward. There was an old woman in Årestrup, and she had to drive her cattle out afterward, and that was a shame. When she’d got through the town, she found a piece of rope which was lying there, and she ran with that and hit her cattle with it, and encouraged them to hurry up. When she later had managed to get rid of the cattle, she was going to go home and churn butter. As soon as she starts churning, the band falls off of it, it had stood there and gotten too dry, it was a willow band that was around it. So now she takes this piece of rope and ties it around the churn instead of the band, and now she churns away. But she got so much cream, she poured it off, and the churn filled up again. She was completely surprised and tells her neighbor that she should come and see this sight with all this cream. It was a witch who had put the piece of rope down so that all of the town’s cattle would walk over it, and then she’d come and take it and tie it around her churn. But now this woman had been late on it with her cattle that day and found the rope and then she got the cream instead.
