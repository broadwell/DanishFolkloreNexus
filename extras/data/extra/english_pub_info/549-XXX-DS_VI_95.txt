There was an old hag who had sold her soul to the Devil. Then her time was up, and he had gotten so far that he was combing her hair with a glowing comb, and it didn't help if she whined or sang, now she was to go with him. At that moment, a student came in who had gone to the black school and prayed for her, and asked if she couldn't be given an extension as long as the stump of candle that was burning on the table would last. The Evil One agreed to that, but then the student took the candle, put it out, and hid it, and then the Devil had to leave without having finished his business.
