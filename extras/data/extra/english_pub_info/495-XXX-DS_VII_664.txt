One day we couldn’t get butter and churned for two or three days. The cream was viscous and good for nothing so we couldn’t even use it for pancakes, but had to throw it away. Then an old Norwegian who went about with beehives comes by and he wants to beg for something to eat. My mother gave him some sour milk to spoon up and a bite of bread as well. “This is some fine milk,” he says now as he’s sitting there. Yes, the milk was good enough, she says snappishly. He says it one more time. “But we get nothing out of it,” she says, “no matter how good it is.” Yes, he could see that well enough. But now he’d give them some advice. They should get a piece of iron forged with three holes in it. Then they should take some sulfur and drip it into each barrel they had. After that, they should get the iron glowing hot and pour the milk over the iron into each barrel. “Then I think that the person who did this will get their nose warmed. If that doesn’t help, I’ll make it so it does help, but I don’t really want to do that.” It helped too.
