Besekorset (Stampeding spell). When you said the following, then the cows weren’t supposed to be able to stampede: When I see a cow stampeding over a field, then it stampedes neither forward nor backward. At night you were supposed to release the spell, and say that they neither stampeded backward nor forward, otherwise they’d die, we shepherds had to remember that.
