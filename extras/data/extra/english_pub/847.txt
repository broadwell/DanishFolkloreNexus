A man who was called Niels Krog and was my neighbor went out on the heath and watched the sheep. There were a huge number of vipers and almost every night they bit a sheep. He was really bad about killing them, and therefore they really hated him. He had a staff with which he smacked them. Then there was a woman who taught him to say to the first one he met: “If you’ll let me mine be, I’ll let you yours be.” After that he left them alone and they him. It was here in Kloster heath it happened.
