My uncle’s son in Lille-Arden was bewitched, and then they took him to a cunning man, they called Yww Luet (Iver L..t). He came and then everybody had to go to bed because if anybody stayed up, it wouldn’t work. He was to talk to the Old One. But then they had a big girl who’d also gone to bed and was supposed to sleep, she was curious, as such people always are, and she lay with the comforter over her head and looked out to see what Ywer was doing. He sat at the table with a bottle of brandy in front of him and took a swig and mixed the medicines that were to be used for this witchcraft. After he’d mixed something, he'd say, “Is it strong enough?” Then there were three knocks in the ceiling and then he stopped. Ever since then, the girl said, “If the Devil wasn’t at my father’s farm that night, then he's never been there.” But the boy died, the witch master didn’t manage to cure him.
