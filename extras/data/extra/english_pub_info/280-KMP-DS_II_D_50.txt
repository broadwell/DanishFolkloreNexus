Near Sjelle bridge runs a river and those who lived near the river and knew it could hear when it wanted someone. According to old talk it was supposed to call out at night and people often drowned there too. You see, they could hear when it wanted a victim. That’s the way it was one night when some Molboers came driving to Randers with fish. Then the current was so strong that they splashed down in there, man and wife and horse and wagon and drowned. The people around there could hear for almost an hour how the woman screamed and they believed that it was her skirts which had held her up, but the man's voice soon became quiet. She drifted down past Fløjstrup and they found her body there.
