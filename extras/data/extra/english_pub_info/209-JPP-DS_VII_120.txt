Eighty years ago, a little woman was the shepherd at Bøgsted, they called her little Rut. An under-chamberlain who was called Qualen lived at the farm, and his father who owned it lived down in Holsten. There wasn’t much more than fourteen days between the times they sent this old woman to Aalborg to run errands for them. She led the sheep out in the morning and then walked off, and as soon as she got south of the farm, they saw her in the shape of a hare that ran south as fast as it could. As soon as it got to Knudsholmen, it jumped over the river east of the farm, and in the evening the hare came again, jumped over and ran to Bøgsted. That was a quick messenger who could run fourteen miles.
