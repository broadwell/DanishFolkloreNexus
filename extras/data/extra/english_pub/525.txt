A thresher was supposed to go to a farm which was quite a distance form the town early one morning; he walked from Sandvig over to Skalsby. When he gets up to Rasmus Bo’s field he sees that there is a gray ram lying on its back with all four legs in the air. The man goes over and lifts it up; when he has walked a little further, he sees that there is exactly one like it lying there. He was a bit puzzled but he went over and righted it as well. Then when he’d walked a little further again, the same fellow is lying there again. But then the man says: “No, now I’ll thank you, you tricked me twice, but you aren’t going to trick me a third time.” Now he knew what it was, and then the nisse laughed.
