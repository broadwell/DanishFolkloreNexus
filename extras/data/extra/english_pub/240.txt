It was at the time when the animals went loose in the fields during the autumn. Then there was a man in Hajjbjöre who rode out to look for his animals and see where they were. He’d put one in the stall the night before because he wanted to have one to ride on the next morning when he was going to go out to look for the others, and so he took it and got up to ride on it. When he got out to the field he could see all his animals except for the gray one. Then he came to a man and he asked him if he could tell him where the gray jade was, he could see all of the others, but he couldn’t see that one. Then the man says, “I think you’re riding on it.” – “What do you know, so I am.”
