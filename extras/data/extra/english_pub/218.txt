Sixty or seventy years ago there was a strong man out in Dronninglund forest, they called him big Kr√¶n Buur. He was so strong that he could pull a tree up with its roots when it wasn't too big. He had the strength of six or eight men. He could load a tree onto a wagon by himself which two horses at that time couldn't pull; but the roads were also bad. So when people had come and chopped down a tree in a dale or on the side of a hill, they could harness their animals to one end and he could lift the other end up and carry it. He could carry the roots when the horses could only pull the top. Big was he, over six feet, and he'd been that big for quite a while.
