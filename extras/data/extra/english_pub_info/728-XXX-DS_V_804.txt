People saw a revenant at Kundby cemetery, even during the day, and it would complain and sometimes put its arms on the wall. One evening, Pastor Busch asked to have his horse saddled but not tied. They could see the minister walking back and forth past the windows in there and finally a message came from the Kundby minister that Pastor Busch should come as quickly as possible. It wasn't long before he got there, and both of the ministers went up to the cemetery that night, and from then on, no one heard from the revenant again.
