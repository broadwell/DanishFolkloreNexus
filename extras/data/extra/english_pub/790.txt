There were two girls who walked past a mound out on Selle mark, and one of them was taken into the mound. Someone came out and took her and got her inside. They didn't know what had happened to her, but then the other girl who'd been with her could tell them. Then one evening, someone went and grabbed her, because the mound was up on four glowing poles then, and the mound dwellers danced underneath it. I've seen the girl who was in there. She really wanted to go back in there because it had been so nice in there with them, it was beyond all belief, she said.
