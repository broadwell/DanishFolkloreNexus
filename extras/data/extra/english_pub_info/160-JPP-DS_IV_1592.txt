Daniel lived in a mound east of Ugilt church on the south side of the road to Linderum. He was really strong and given to killing people. He was supposed to have eaten two child hearts and would have eaten the third, he had it in his hand when he was caught. If heâ€™d gotten that, no one would have been able to take him and he would have been able to break iron and everything in two. He had his head chopped off.
