It was in Balle, their shepherd disappeared and was gone for eight days. They thought that he’d fallen into a water hole and drowned. But then one day when they were out mowing, they saw that a whole group of beautiful young girls came out of a grove of alders and danced and the boy was with them. The farmhand threw down his scythe and jumped right in the middle of them and grabbed the boy. The young girls didn’t say anything but stood and looked at him a bit and then they turned around and went back into the alders. The boy couldn’t tell them anything other than that he’d been with these beautiful women and afterward he was never quite right in the head.
