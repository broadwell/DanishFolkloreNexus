A grocer rode from Ringkjøbing to Varde with three hundred ducats in his carpet bag. He was found murdered and plundered in a dale, which is called Nærrild dale in Lyne parish, where the partitioned manor farm Østergård now is. They tried to get on the trail of the culprit to no avail. A long time later several men sat together in Lyne Inn one night. They started to talk about their hunting experiences, and one after the other they told about great shots that they had made. Then one man who had been sitting and listening spoke up and said: “All of this is nothing compared to what I can tell. The best shot I’ve ever made was once when I was hunting in Nærrild dale, because I killed a black cock there who had three hundred golden feathers in his tail.” At that moment, three drops of blood fell from his nose onto the table. One of the men jumped up and shouted: “It was you who shot the grocer!” The sinner now admitted his crime and suffered the punishment he had earned.
