I was walking one night from Boes mill where I’d been working, and then a real thunder storm starts, but it wasn’t directly overhead and it hadn’t started raining either. Just as I’m walking past Dakbjærg, I notice something around me. Flame shot up out of my hat and I had fire in my beard. I got scared because I’d heard a lot about that mountain and I wasn’t happy being there and I ran home. But that was måårild.
