Over in Voldum there was a farmhand who was plowing between Voldum and Hvall√∏s and there was a small mound that lay right close by. So when he was down at the other end of the field, an oven rake came up and it was in pieces. So he fixes it. At noontime, he drove home to Voldum and went back out there in the afternoon. Then there was a cake lying there at the place where the [oven] rake had lain. He cut into it and ate it and things turned out really well for him.
