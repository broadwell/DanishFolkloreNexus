Many years ago, there was a miller at Seest mill who was a Doppelg√§nger (double walker). Often, people knew for sure that he had gone to market or was working many miles from home, and yet they saw him walking about in the outlying buildings or in the fields. They didn't like him, because they could never relax since he often was two places at the same time. The mill often ran in the middle of the night, and when people got up to investigate, it was nothing.
