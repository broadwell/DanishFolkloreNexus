There was an old woman who lived in Billum about whom they said that she could poke little hole in a milk bucket and then milk would flow into it. We had a dean Sehested who said to her that she could gather just as much butter as all the other village women. She answered that she had nothing other than what she had gotten by God and honor. Then he says: “I didn’t say that you didn’t have it by God and honor, I didn’t say that.”
