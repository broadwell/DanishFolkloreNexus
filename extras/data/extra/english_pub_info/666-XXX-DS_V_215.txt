Old Kræn Mejlhede’s father was out one night to move the animals. When he was coming back and wanted to cross the road, he heard down by the wall a loud rustling and then a headless horse came along the road, and the rider was also headless. They went off towards the town, and steam came out of the horse’s nose. “I hurried on home, since I got scared,” he said when he told about it.
