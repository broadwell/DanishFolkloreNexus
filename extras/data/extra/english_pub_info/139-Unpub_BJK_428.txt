10 fox skins and 15 cubits of scarlet, and one barrel of oil, that’s what the tailors were to have to make a pussy, because the woman had lost hers. The man got up in front of her. She sat on a seat board on the wagon and he sat on a hay seat and lifted her skirts but couldn’t figure out how all of that was supposed to fit in such a small hole. Then he saw that the tailor had stolen both the fox skins and the scarlet, but there was tar.
