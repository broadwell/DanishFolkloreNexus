A midwife in Torslev was with a woman who was going to give birth. The birth pains were so bad and the woman wailed pitiably. Then her husband says, “Yeah, that's really something to blubber about, what a wretch,” and he tells his wife to shut up. “You shouldn't say that,” says the midwife, “you better believe it's a hard trip.” No, he didn't count that as anything. “Then you'll also get to feel it,” says the midwife. Then the man goes out, but just as soon as he gets outside, he gets so sick, so sick, and he gets the pains his wife had before. And he continued to have them until his wife gives birth, but then it was over. The midwife calls to him now and asks if he'll stand by those words he'd said before. No, he wouldn't, it was a really hard trip.
