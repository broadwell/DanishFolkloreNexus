A farm supposedly once stood near Damsg√•rd swamp in Vesterheden. Then it happened that they slaughtered their pig and decided to play a trick on the minister . . . They put the pig in a bed and spread a sheet over it. Then the minister asked where the sick one was, and then they lifted the sheet and showed him the pig. But that trick had bad consequences for them. Because as soon as the minister saw what they wanted to do to him, he went out of the room to his wagon, and the farm and everything in it began to sink. In his haste, the minister had forgotten his book on the table; the table didn't sink before the minister had gotten his book. Then everything disappeared into the ground.
