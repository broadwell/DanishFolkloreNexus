Poul Lyne in Sønderskov had sworn himself to the Devil. One time he was supposed to go to a birthing over in Ty and it was during the winter. When they drove off, there was a dog lying in the back of the wagon. Then when they were going to go home, they wanted to drive over the ice. But then they came to a big crack, and the driver didn’t dare drive over it. “Drive ahead, damn you! [literally, ‘for the Devil’] yelled Paul. “No, I will not drive in his name, I will drive in Jesus’s name.” Then he drove, but everything sank under the ice. The farmhand came up and came ashore alive. He said he could hear the horses breathing down there. After that time, Paul Lyne walked again and they could hear him coming in his high boots. He was conjured down by a curate in Gudum.
