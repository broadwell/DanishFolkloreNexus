The mound man would come and take little children from people and put his own in there place. Such a thing happened once to a woman who could clearly see that she had gotten the mound man’s child, since it stayed little, it just got fatter and fatter. Because of this she complained to everybody. But one day a woman came who gave her some good advice: “ “On Sunday and every day you sweep your floor, you should lay the child by the door, just like you were going to sweep it out, then the mound man will come soon with yours and take his own again,” she said. She did that too and it didn’t last too long before he came, but he was angry. “Look,” he said, “I didn’t take care of your child like you took care of my child.” With that he took his own and disappeared. The one who was happy, that was the woman who had gotten her own child again.
