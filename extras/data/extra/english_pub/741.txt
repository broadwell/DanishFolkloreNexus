The Black Smith in NÃ¸rre-Tranders could stop a pair of run away horses. He did once up here by the mill. A couple of guys were driving with a man from Klarup and then they also stopped in at the mill. The horses were standing in front of the wagon at the time, and then they stampeded. The man who owned them was sitting inside and got very upset, but then the smith, who was also sitting inside there said, "It won't help, let me go outside." He went outside quickly, and then the horses stopped at the first farm to the east of the mill. "Now we can go in and have us another dram," said the smith, and the horses kept standing there too until they came for them. Another time, it was the smith's wife who did it, since she could do it too, she could. It was a couple of horses pulling a load of hay. She said, "Wait a bit, you aren't supposed to go that way," and then they stood there down on Utrup road by Jens Rytter's place. The Black Smith was also a good animal doctor too.
