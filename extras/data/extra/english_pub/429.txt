Pastor Mikelsen at Dover Church. They were to an examination—then he gets to a lazy head, and asks him if he knew what our first parents were called. An older boy who sat in the chair behind him whispered, “He was called Adam.” And what about his wife? Madam Adamsen. “Yes, that’s right my son, in our days, it would have been like that, but what was her baptismal name?” “Jews aren’t baptized” said this kid behind him. “Also quite right my son. But what name did she get at her circumcision?” “There’s nothing to cut off.” This apparently happened in Dover Church.
