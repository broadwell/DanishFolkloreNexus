A woman from Nedre-Hornbæk had gone to Randers with her two sons. When they were on their way home again, and just as they stepped out of Videmølle vold and had come back on the Hornbæk property, she heard that it was ringing underneath them in the ground. So one of the boys ran home to get a shovel and he dug where it was ringing, and now it began to chime, and it chimed for three hours. Not too long after, the black death broke out. It broke out first in Randers and they believe it was brought there by ship.
