When the mound dwellers have gotten a hold of a little girl from the human world through "changing," and she later becomes a mound man's wife, then she cannot give birth to her children unless a Christian woman comes and delivers her. That's how a little creature came riding to Vejvad in Vinding near Holstebro and wanted the woman there to come with him to his wife. The farmwife wasn't too excited about the trip, but the mound man said that she didn't need to be afraid as long as she sat on the horse differently than he did. She did that, and before she knew it, they were down at the mound man's place. She delivered the woman, and the man was so happy about that that he gave her a handful of wood shavings, she should save them so she could light the fire with them the next morning, he figured. The woman didn't understand what he meant, but she kept the shavings and when the mound man had pulled the horse up, sat up on it and asked her to get up as well, she did that, but she didn't forget to sit backwards since the mound man had sat down properly on the horse, and before she knew it, she was home again. When she looked at the shavings the next morning, they'd turned into heavy lumps of gold.
