There was a place where the farmhand could lie in his bed and hear when the mare was on the horses. But as soon as he yelled “Fyllifyl!” then it got off of them. But then it wasn’t too long before it came back and wanted to get up on the horse again. He noticed that it stood and lurked and wanted to come when he had gone to bed. Then he talked inside about how bad it was and how the horses were about to be wasted by it. They’d heard that if one threw a pail of water on it, then it would go away. So then one night he and the farmer stood there with a pail of water and when they heard it come, they threw it on the horse. Then a naked woman was standing there, “Oh, why did you do that, I have to go over both lakes and salt water to get to my small children.” Then they helped her home and she didn’t wind up going as a mare any longer.
