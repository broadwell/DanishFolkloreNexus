South of the highway between Nyborg and Ringe in Jens Andersen's field across the way from Bæksmeden’s house there is a small swamp, which is called Bell swamp or Bell sump. The following is told concerning the origin of that name: During the time when the bell tower was over the western church arch, one day while they were ringing for a corpse, the bell rope was torn out of the hands of the man who was ringing, and the bell flew out of the sound holes and sank down in the named swamp, where it is said to ring on the high holy days. During the time that they were moving the tower, they often heard a sound from the swamp as if they were ringing a bell in the distance.
