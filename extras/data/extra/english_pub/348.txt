My foster-mother was from Egå and served Niels Andersen there. There was a nisse and he visited her many times. When she was frightened, he said that she shouldn’t be afraid of him, he wouldn’t hurt her, because he noticed that she could see him. They always milked their cows out by an ash tree because that’s where he had his house and so they always got more butter and milk. The farmer’s wife was supposed to cook porridge for nis every day, and what he didn’t finish he always used to feed a horse. It was used to getting his left-overs. Then one day while they sat and milked, he came and knocked the milk away from the farmer’s wife. “Sure, I know there wasn’t enough butter in your porridge today,” she said, “but if you’ll leave me alone, I’ll give you more butter tomorrow, I didn’t have enough today.” He always went around and fed the horses, but one time they had a farmhand who wanted to lift him out of the stall. Then the nis says to him: “No, wait a moment, we have to go over there and get more oats for the horses.” He got him to come along too. The farmhand bound ten sheaves together, but nis took a shock (sixty sheaves). When they got half way, the farmhand wanted to rest. After they’d rested, the nis said, “If I’d known that rest existed, then I would have brought just as much more.” When they got home, the farmhand was happy because now he’d gotten something to use for feed, and afterward nis could go and feed just as much as he wanted to. Then they got another farmhand, and he didn’t want to let him go on like that. But he got lifted up in his bed and all the way up to the rafters, so he lay there dead when people got up the next morning.
