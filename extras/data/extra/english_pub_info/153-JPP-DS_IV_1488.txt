A man on Spangerhede who was called Færch, he sold a horse to someone in Ålborg for six hundred rixdollars. At the same time, a farmhand was working there as a coachman, he was called Jens Snårup and had been a cavalry soldier in Randers and was used to riding. So he rode on a cavalry horse and was leading the horse that had been sold. When he came to Langbro Inn on the way home, he went in there and wanted a shot of akvavit and a drop of beer. Two others were sitting in there. He sits down now and tells the innkeeper that he'd been in Ålborg and had six hundred rixdollars on him. “You'd better stay here tonight,” says the innkeeper, “because you won't get through the Østbjærg hills.” The two had left just after they'd heard that. Well, he says he wants to go home because his boss was waiting for him, he had to go home to Spangerhede that night. The horse got a little feed then and he journeyed off. When he was half way into the woods, a guy comes up to him and really wants to ride along, he was so tired. But Jens wouldn't let him up. “I'm used to riding by myself.” But then he continues to walk along holding onto the bridle. When they were a good way in, the other one yells that he should hold on tight to the horse. Then the farmhand cuffs him one on the ear so he spins around two, three times. The horse was off and running fast immediately, but the two are so fast that one of them is right up front with him in a moment. But then he wallops him with the butt of a pistol he had with him so he stumbles along the road and the other one fled. Then he didn't see them any more. The farmhand was very strong and he counted on that.
