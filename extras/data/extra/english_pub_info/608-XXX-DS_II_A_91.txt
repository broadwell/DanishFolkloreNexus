On Alken field in Skanderborg lies Dakbjærg, which measures about twenty meters from the ground to the top. Several years ago, a group of elves lived there. Every night, when the sun had set, the mound was raised and put on four stones and then they danced. People who passed by could see them well enough, but they only got to see them from the front, where they looked quite nice. A shepherd from Alken who had been out putting the sheep down for the night, came by on his way home. He stopped to watch the dance. A little later an elf girl came and asked him to the dance and he went with her without thinking anything about it. The next morning some people passed by the mound and they found his body, he’d been danced to death by the elf girl.
