When Master Laust drove one evening from Århus, he saw that there was light in Trige church, and so he says to the coachman that he should stop, and then he went in there. But as he left he said to the farmhand, “Wait here and don’t drive until someone comes and says, Drive now in the name of Jesus Christ. Many will come and order you to drive, but you may not.” First one came and then another who said, “Drive now, drive now!” and sat down beside him, but he wouldn’t do it. Finally Master Laust came and said, “Drive now in the name of Jesus Christ.” But when he tried to drive, the wagon wouldn’t budge. “Can you get down and put the right rear wheel up in the wagon behind us?” He did that. “Drive now!” said the minister, and then he could drive. When they got home, the farmhand put his wheel on again, and then Master Laust went up to the cemetery and said to someone, “Follow me.” The farmhand in the meantime couldn’t see anything. Then he was up there for a little while and then he came back, and then everything was in order.
