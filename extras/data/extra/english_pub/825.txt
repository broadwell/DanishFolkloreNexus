There had been a harsh storm on the North Sea and many ships had nearly foundered. When it eventually became better weather, two ships met out on the sea and came so close to each other, that the people could shout to each other about where they came from and where their home harbor was and so on. At the same time, they hear that two nisser are shouting to each other from the top of the masts, one on each ship, about how they had fared during the storm. The first one said: “I’ve had enough to do holding the jib stay, otherwise the mast would have fallen down.” When the people looked up to see about the voice, the nisse let go of the stay, which immediately fell down on deck, and he started to laugh hysterically. Now the people had something else to think about than to look at the nisse, because the mast nearly fell overboard. While they were busy getting the mast set again, the nisse saw his chance to take off down into the hold where they couldn’t find him.
