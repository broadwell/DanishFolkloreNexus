There was a mound on our property called Hesteh√∏j (Horse mound), and there had also been noises in there, but no one had seen any mound folk. But they did see a light that burned on it but when they got close, it disappeared. I've seen the light too and gone after it. It isn't three weeks since our son came home and said the light was there again.
