There’s a farm in Ugilt called Dalsager. The man on the farm, the old Kræn Dalsager, he moved the main house three times to get rid of a ghost that haunted there. Every New Years eve a big black dog came and lay down in the scullery near the gutter. Those who saw him said that his eyes were like the clearest fire. They were supposed to have clean hay there every New Years eve and if he didn’t get it, then people couldn’t stay there at the farm. The dog would tip over the beds and throw them out of their beds and everything, and then he whined so he could be heard far away, there was quite a voice in that ghost. When it had shown itself several times, the man moved the house, that was the first time, but it was there again the next New Years eve. They lay down fresh hay in the scullery and then it was quiet. This ghost had such a reputation that none of the girls would go and put the hay down for it, and so he moved the house a second time; now he was sure that it would work out. But it was still the same. The haunting continued and they had to put hay down there again. But then the man moved the house for the third time and a bit further away and then they were free of that dog. Since then its supposed to have been quiet at Dalsager. The last time that the farm was built up was in my time.
