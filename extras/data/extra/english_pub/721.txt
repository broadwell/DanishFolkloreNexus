In Jebjærg there was a curate who was called Nielsen. He was driving to Hjerk parsonage to visit, and when he drove back over Tinggårds bridge in Vium, the back wheel couldn't turn because the Devil was holding onto it. Then the curate said to his farmhand that he should get off and take the wheel and put it up in the wagon, and that's how they drove home. Then the curate wanted to try to conjure the Devil, but he couldn't get him to go down. He took off for fourteen days, and sent a message to a neighboring minister that he should come and help him. When the day came, the curate let his farmhand drive over and get the minister. He said to the farmhand when he got up in the wagon that he mustn't speak to him, and when they got to Vium Tinggårds bridge, he advised the farmhand to drive as fast as he could because the Devil was ahead of them. When they got to a little house outside of Jebjærg, the curate was fighting the Evil One there. The minister went to his aid and they chased the Devil over the curate's garden wall where he was conjured down, and a big stone was placed over him. That stone was moved away just a few years ago, and that was a monument to the Devil. There was a bunch of Roman writing on it.
