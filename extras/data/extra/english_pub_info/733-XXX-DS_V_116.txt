Near the Royal Lerskov Orchard there is a pond, which is called Klarvand (Clear pond). The pond hasn’t always been there, it’s been filled up with a large number of fallen trees since then, and there must have been a big forest there in the olden days. Per Jensen from Øster-Løgum was out there once and then he saw a gigantic man get up all of a sudden, he had hooks on his clothes instead of buttons and looked quite odd. But now while Per began to look at him, he roared so loud that the church tower in Øster Løgum cracked.
