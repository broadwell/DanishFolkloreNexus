In Bedsted there's Tofth√∏j, and the owner started digging in it. Then he lost a nag and the next day a cow and then a short while later another cow. Then he came to think that maybe it was the mound's fault. He went up to dean Bentzon here and told him about it and asked him if he thought that it was punishment for that. He answered that since he thought that himself he should leave the mound alone, but if he didn't think that, then he wouldn't say anything. He went home and covered up the hole. Then the bad luck stopped. He instructed his son to preserve the mound and he did the same later for his son-in-law. Now it has been given to the state.
