It is said about a manor lord from Rask in Hvirring that he occasionally visited the Devil in his abode. One night late the order came to the driver to get the carriage ready. The lord, the lady, and more people got up in it and when the driver asked where he was supposed to drive, the lord answered, “Follow the black dog.” The road was wide and level and it wasn’t too long before they stopped by a big castle lit by many lanterns with an iron gate in front which immediately opened and on the stairway stood the Old One laughing. He greeted them and brought them inside. Finally they came out and were directed by the black dog to their home.
