A hired boy sat in the field eating his sandwich. There was grated cheese on it and it started to blow away. So he threw his clogs off. “Where are you going?” asked the farmer. “I’m going to run after my cheese otherwise I won’t get any of it.” It helped since he never got grated cheese when he was out in the field again.
