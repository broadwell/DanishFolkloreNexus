There was a time when some children were born here who were crippled both in body and soul. There were particularly two who were so terribly crippled and it isn’t too long ago, since I remember seeing one of them in my childhood, and I’m now almost forty-four. It was said that the elves had come and switched children. There were some people here once who had taken their child along to the field and lain it on the ground. Then an elf woman came who had taken it and put her own in its place. The parents took the child home but were cruel to it. Then the elf woman came again with their child and wanted her child switched, “because you hit mine and I kissed yours.”
