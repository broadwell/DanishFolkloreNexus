When the fishermen on Vanø got their catch on land early in the morning, they usually saw a gull which flew over and snapped up one of the best eels and disappeared with it over behind Fiirbjærg. Later they saw a woman, who was suspected of being a witch, come out from the other side of the hill. Another witch could turn herself into a hare. When the hunter came after it, he’d catch nothing that day, he could hunt as much as he wanted. The minister went to visit her once to investigate this case, and asked her if it was true that she could run like a hare. She at first wouldn’t talk about it, but finally she said that if he couldn’t see it on her when she went to to communion, then he was a bad minister. She couldn’t swallow the bread, you see.
