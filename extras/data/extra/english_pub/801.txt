After the plague there were only two women left in one place. One morning they come out into their cabbage patch, and there they find the corpse of a man and they bring him in because, when they turned him, they noticed there was life in the body. When he was inside, he comes completely back to life and he gets better. It was at a widow and her daughterâ€™s house, and the daughter married him. There were no people in all of the surrounding areas except these three people, and so the population there in the area descended from them. This happened somewhere here in Jutland.
