A woman in Madum told me that her father had known a man who one day had been out harvesting grain near a river and out of habit he wound up injuring a viper there. At noontime, he lay down to sleep, but no sooner had he lain down than a viper came and wanted to hit him. He noticed that it was just like the one he'd injured, and it wanted revenge, and so he took it and threw over to the other side of the river, and so then he figured that it was well out of the way, and so he lay quietly down to sleep again, but he woke with the hit of a viper bite, and so it got revenge anyway.
