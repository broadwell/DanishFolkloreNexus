In the main room at Søndergården at Nielstrup, where there had once been a meeting room, things were wrong. Some people had been out shoveling snow and had gotten lost and wound up staying at the farm up in the meeting room. The people had baked that day and had put their bread at the end of the table. Then the visitors saw--it was a wonderfully moonlit night--that a big black dog came in there. Then they thought that it was the farm dog and were afraid that it would take the bread and so they wanted to chase it away. But then it looked at them with two big mean eyes and stood still and didn’t move, and a little later the vision disappeared.
