Two gypsy women came to Røved and asked for shelter for the night. But one of them got sick there and had a child and the people had to fetch both women and the midwife from the town. She stayed there a month after she’d had the baby, and then two men came with so much food and drink and other things, so they held a big feast for the townsfolk, all of those that had helped them and cared for the woman in her birth bed. It was supposed to be a sort of childbirth banquet and the child was brought to the church at the same time. The feast was quite lively because there was both gambling and dancing. The townsfolk thought that it was strange that these gypsies could be so well off that they could hold such a large banquet for them. Afterward the men left with their wives and children.
