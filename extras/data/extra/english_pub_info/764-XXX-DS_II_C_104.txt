A night raven is supposed to be someone who is buried at a T-shaped field marker and who has done something wrong. There are certain paths in the ground they follow before they come out. A girl had once been out doing the evening milking, and then she heard the night raven too, and she yelled at it. But then it came after her, and she hurried inside and locked the door. But the next morning, the door was completely covered with blood.
