They came down through Månnes hollow and saw that Dakbjærg was raised up on four glowing poles, and the mound folk were swinging about in there to music played all-out, and a little man wearing a big red cap sat and looked from the top of the mound. There’s no doubt that there was something out there because once they were out haying in Alken at around lunch time, and that was nearby the mound. They were going to go home and eat their lunch but one of the girls didn’t want to go along, she thought that she was so heavy, and so the others went and let her be. When they came back, she was frothing at the mouth and those devils had danced her to death. She was dead and stayed dead.
