I've heard Howen's hunter. One time he'd gone after a flock of elf women. A person sat under a bridge and then these elf women came running over it. They came flapping along just like a flock of geese. The hunter came behind them, and his dogs  panted, and he said, "Tohejj, tohejj!" It's an old legend that he is supposed to chase these women off the road, but the man who sat under the bridge didn't know whether he caught them or not.
