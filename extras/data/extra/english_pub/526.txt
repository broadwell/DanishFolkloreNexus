Some say that when the ship ran aground in the fjord, they couldnâ€™t get over it, so they had to throw one of the bells overboard. Others say that it was lost when it was to be carried from the ship to land. The bell has a wonderful melancholy clang on holy nights and it calls after the other one, which answers from the bottom of the fjord.
