A poor boy was sent out onto the fields to look for some run away cattle in sleet and bad weather. As he walked out there soaking wet and hungry, he comes to a mound. Then a mound woman comes and gives him a spoonful of porridge. It tasted so amazingly good that he asked for one more, and he got it too. But he couldn’t have a third, said the mound woman, because then he’d get too strong. He had now become so unusually strong, and he was the strongest man in Kåstrup.
