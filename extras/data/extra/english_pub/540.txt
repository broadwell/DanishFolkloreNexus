A river man lives in Odense river. Every year he requires a victim, and if it happens during a single year that nobody drowns, then he’ll make sure to take two the next year. So it is told that two small boys once went and played by the river banks and one of them fell into the water. “No, I want both of you, I didn’t get any last year,” and at the same time the boy slipped out into the water and they both drowned. A couple of men who witnessed the accident from the other bank at a little distance wanted to try and help the boys but they came too late. The boys were drowned and they never found their bodies; the river man had held onto them. 
     This was told to me in and around Odense by many people, among them my own mother and my aunt, Maren Kirstine Johansen, who lived in Dræby, and by old Madam Brun and Smith Rasmussen in Odense.
