So many people had died because of the plague that there was only one person left here in the area. So then he asked himself what he should do. He goes over to the top of the fire mountains from where you can count eighteen church spires, and from there he could see down into Mosbjærg parish. There was a small hut down there from which smoke was coming and so he decided to go down there. It was an old woman who was still alive. The two got married and stayed with each other, and they were the only ones here in the area. She had driven all of the dead away and had only one oxen to drive them away with, but she couldn’t get sick because she smoked a chalk pipe.
