An old woman lived near Copenhagen and she was very wise. Nearby lived a man who was afraid of her and believed that she could witch. One time, he was supposed to go to Copenhagen and then the old woman wanted to send a message with him but he said no. Then she said that he’d come to regret that, his red horse could easily be hit with something. At night when he came home, he told this to the farmhand and then he went out to spend the night in the stall with the horse. When he had stood a little while, the woman came and put something into the stall with the horse. Then the farmhand grabbed her, killed her and buried her outside of the farm. He planted a tree on that place and it's standing on Brøndby hill to this very day.
