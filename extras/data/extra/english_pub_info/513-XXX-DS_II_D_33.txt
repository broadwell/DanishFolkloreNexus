Earlier, a mermaid, who lived in the Kattegat, let her twelve red cows and her red bull graze on the farmers’ fields. But once the farmers said to the mermaid that she had to pay for the cows from now on. But she had nothing to pay with. Yes, they said, she had her belt, which shined of gold and silver. She gave that to them too, but then it was nothing but a sieve. When the mermaid was to drive her cattle out to sea, she turned around and said: “Now, my red bull, now you wander as much as you want on the bottom,” which it did too, and that’s where drift sandbanks come from.
