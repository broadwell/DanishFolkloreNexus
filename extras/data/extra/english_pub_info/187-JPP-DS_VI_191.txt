Knold Kræn had a Ceperånus (Cyprianus). He’d gotten it down in Torslev from a man who had four, but he never used it. One time, however, he’d gotten it down off the shelf and sat there reading in it. Just as he’s sitting there, a sharpening stone which was sitting right next to him breaks in half and it made a really loud noise as if someone had shot a rifle right next to him. Then he got scared and put the Ceperånus back up on the shelf. I was supposed to get it from him and we’d arranged a day when he was supposed to bring it. But then my father got me to run an errand in town and he told me what it said on the title page too. When I’d heard that I’d also had enough. Knold-Kræn came too but since I wasn’t home he went on to Lørslev and I didn’t get any book.
