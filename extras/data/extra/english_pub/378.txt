While Pastor Pedersen was minister in Svejstrup, there was a girl in the parsonage who had been knocked up by the feed hand and he was a married man. When the time came that she was to give birth, the delivery was really hard. They wanted her to say who the father of the child was because that usually can help. But she wouldn’t. Then she died undelivered and was buried and it was never cleared up who the father of the child was. But every evening, just after sunset, a white virgin would come out of the cemetery and walk to the parsonage and disappear there by the stall door in the farmhand’s room and nobody saw anymore of her until she went again. Finally it got so bad that no one dared stay there at that time of the evening, they ran away. One evening Mr. Pedersen asked all of them to go to bed, not a single sound could be uttered, and the doors were closed and locked. Himself, he gets into his robes and collar and then he went out to meet her, and after that they never saw her again. But not a living soul found out what they’d negotiated between them.
