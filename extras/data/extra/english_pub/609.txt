Nisser are known all over the place. It’s said here that when a man makes more progress than others under similar circumstances, then he has a nisse. In a town in Nordfalster, two neighbors each had a nisse, but only one of the men made progress, whereas the other man continuously went backwards (economically); it was because one of the nisser was called “Jolly” and the other was called, “"Watch Out.”
