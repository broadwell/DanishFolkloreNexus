After the time of the plague, there was but a single solitary woman in Gjerlev village, and she became acquainted with a man from way out west, out there from Gassum or Hvedsten. When he was supposed to come, she was sweeping cobwebs down, and the plague was still in the house, and it quickly took her and she lay dead when he came. It was odd enough that she was to die after all.
