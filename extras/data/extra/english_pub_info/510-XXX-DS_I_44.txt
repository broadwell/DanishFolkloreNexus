At dusk one time there was a group of boys up on a hill that was called Gildebjærg (in Høsterkøb). They were riding sleds down the hill down to a big swamp. As they were playing, a huge crowd of small black men came wandering up the hill; the boys ran home as fast as they could, and didn't go to get their sleds back until the next morning.
