Between Virdsted and Vrove lies Vrove mound, where they say there used to be a lot of mound dwellers. One night, the minister from Vrove along with his coachman drove past the mound and then it raised itself up on four glowing poles and underneath it the mound dwellers danced. The coachman looked down at it, but the minister told him to watch the reins, since he was afraid that he [the coachman] would become elf-wild.
