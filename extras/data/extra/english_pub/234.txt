My grandmother had been over visiting a relative in Halling and had a little boy with her, and then they walked home to Nielstrup where she lived. When they got out onto Halling heath, then the boy says, “Look, mother, who are those two men walking?” Then she looked and it looked to her as if there were two men walking with a chain between them. They passed right in front of them and they could both here the chain rattle and they heard that the men were mumbling, but it wasn’t real talk. She continued watching them but they disappeared all of a sudden.
