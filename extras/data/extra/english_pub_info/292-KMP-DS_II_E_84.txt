There was a lindorm that lay around Århus cathedral, and by the end it was just about ready to encircle completely the church. They’d been after it several times but they couldn’t get the upper hand. Finally they raised a bull for three years on sweet milk and nuts. It went out against the lindorm but couldn’t stand up to it. Then they fed it for three years, and then it got the upper hand.
