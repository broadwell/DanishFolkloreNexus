A widower married his wife in Gjøl, that was my aunt (mother’s sister). She had had a lover before and he walked in on them one day and said, Good day! and she greeted him as well but otherwise they didn’t have anything to say to each other. The man was nevertheless upset about that visit and when they were to go to bed, he lay across the bed so that she practically couldn’t get into it with him and she had to sleep on the outside of the bed and watch the child. It was one he had had with his first wife. It started to cry and then she said to herself that it should be allowed to cry because it was his child and not hers. Then the real mother came and lay over the bed until the child was quiet. The wife now sat up in bed and told her that she should go to her resting place since the child would not suffer as long as she was alive. The child never was quite right, but was big and strong anyways.
