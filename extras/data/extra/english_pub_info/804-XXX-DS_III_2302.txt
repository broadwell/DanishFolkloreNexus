Three men from Avning had decided to go up and dig in the middle Thorsbakke (Thor’s hills), which lies a little northeast of the church, to try and find gold. Now one of them was sort of a fool and the others warned him not to talk. When it was 12 o’clock, they began to dig. Finally, they came upon something, but immediately the man began to laugh really hard. The others looked very curiously at him, as if to say, “What is it?” — “Well, well, I’ve seen a lot in my days, but never before have I seen a wagon drawn by four roosters, and that just came driving down past here.” — Then it was all over. Another time they wanted to try it and they went into a cobbler to get him to help, but he didn’t want to come along. So they went out there alone and began to dig but found nothing besides a rotten horse thigh that night. They took that along with them on the way home and tossed it into the cobbler’s front room to humiliate him. But sorry! The next day it was pure gold.
