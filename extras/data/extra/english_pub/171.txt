Jens Peter Pedersen was born the first of May, 1836 on Borup field in Tårs. His father was born in Tranum, Han herred, and told him a great deal of the stories he can tell. But both his father, mother and mother’s mother told a lot. The latter was from Tårs and was, by the way, the sister of bookseller Chr. Steen in Copenhagen, who ran away from home, probably to get out of working as a hired hand, came to Copenhagen and became a bookbinder apprentice. Jens Peter learned how to turn in Hjørring and has now lived in Ilbjærge in a little house for 26 years. He has always been unmarried, and he lives humbly. The last time we took leave, he had a really difficult time saying goodbye to me. I could clearly see that he wanted me to stay with him a bit longer, since he was quite interested in getting these old things written down. One evening, he came up to where I was staying at Lørslev school in the pouring rain and he sat the whole evening in wet clothes and told. He was used to difficulties, and a little rain didn’t do him any harm he said.
