There was a woman who had drowned herself in Skals river. Since that time she walked again and there were many who had seen her revenant. Either it was her red shirt or her red sleeves, one could see them. Then there was a man who wanted to talk to her so she could have peace in her grave. But when he came to her and named her by name, she said to him: “It won’t help; just as many years that I died before I was supposed to, that’s how many years I will wander about the place where I killed myself.”
