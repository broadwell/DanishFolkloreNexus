Many years ago there was a poor cotter in Lyngs who had a threshing grounds in Mærkdal, but he went home to his family almost every night and went again early the next morning to his work. Then one night when he was walking home, two beautiful young women came and started to follow him, but nobody said a word. When they came to Bavnvang, he was tired and sat down next to Bavnhøj to rest a bit; but before he could look around, the young women had disappeared. When he got up again to leave, he said: “Little misses, shall we walk together again.” Nobody answered but a headless horse came up to his side and followed him all the way to his door. After that, he went a different way.
