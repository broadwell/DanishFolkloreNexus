When the black plague raged in Jutland, only one person was left in Roum parish. He waited for death just like everybody else, and so he dug himself a grave in the cemetery, which he planned to lie down next to when the sickness attacked him, hoping that a survivor would at some point push him into the grave. But he never had use for the grave since he survived the plague.
