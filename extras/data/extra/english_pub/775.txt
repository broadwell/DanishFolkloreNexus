Close to the east of Høje town in Lunde parish there's a large gravel mound they call Gammelhøj (Old Mound). A mound man lived here once and he brought a woman in the neighborhood into the mound to swaddle children. When the woman was finished and was to go home, the mound man gave her an apron full of coal. The woman didn't think it was worth the trouble to carry it home, and so she threw them away outside. But when she got home, much to her surprise and disappointment, she saw that it was gold that the mound man had given her for her inconvenience, since there was still a little gold dust clinging to her apron.
