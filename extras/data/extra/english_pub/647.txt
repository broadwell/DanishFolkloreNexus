On the farm Torsmark near Brønderslev an old couple lived many years ago, and they loved each other so much that they wished that neither should survive the other. They also had their wish fulfilled, since they both died at the same time. But nevertheless one saw them walk arm in arm up the road which went from the cemetery to Torsmark, the doors in the farm opened as if by themselves and they strolled in, clothed in long white clothes. In the bedroom they stopped by the door, the same way they came in. The owner of the farm had the minister fetched so they could find out from the revenants what they were looking for and when they appeared one night, the minister addressed them with these words: “My soul praises God,” at which point they both answered, “Mine does too.” “What are you walking here for then?” asked the minister. The wife began to speak and said that she had hidden twenty-four shillings in a sock tree which was hidden under the bed. “When you lift the big stone which is loose,” she said, “then you’ll find the treasure.” At which point they both disappeared. The next day they looked under the bed and found the money sure enough, just as the dead woman had said. From that point on, the two old people had peace in the grave, since no one ever saw them walk to the farm to repeat their nightly visit.
