In a farm in Kolby, there was a nisse who was used to regularly getting his milk and porridge every night and, because of that, every thing was OK at the farm. But all at once, the man decided that he didn’t want to give the nisse anything anymore; that was unwise of him because from that point on it went continuously downhill for him, so he became just as poor as he’d been wealthy before, and it was the nisse’s fault, since at night he carried stuff away from the farm and over to another farmer.
