My great grandfather's wife was so sick in her thighs and hips and screamed so. They lived near Rude church and the minister went over there with his cattle on Sundays, he was called Buhmann by the way. Then my great grandfather said to him, “I don't know what I should do, father, I wonder if I should go to a cunning man, since some have advised me to do that, but I don't really know.”—“Well, little Rasmus,” says the minister, “just you go in God's name, since there are both good and evil folk about.” So then he went to the man, I don't know where he lived, and my great grandfather was so unhappy. The folk healer said: “You can take it easy because since this afternoon at two o'clock she's been at peace.” Then he thought that she was dead. But when he went back and came in the door, she yelled out to him: “You don't have to walk so quietly, Rasmus, because since this afternoon at two o'clock I've had peace, I've really gotten better.” Then the man realized that it was right what the cunning man had said but how it could be explained he could never figure out. The woman got better from that day on.
