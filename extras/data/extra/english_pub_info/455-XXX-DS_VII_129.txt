In Ty there was a hare which went and sniffed around peoples’ houses and was running about everywhere, they could almost walk up to it. Then they realized that it was best if they made the situation right, so the man loads his rifle and shoots at it. It gets hit in the one thigh and runs limping away. He watched where it ran to and it scooted in through the hen house door in a little house. Then he wanted to go in there and see. Then the woman of the house was sitting next to the wood burning stove and complained that it hurt so much in one of her thighs, she had fallen and hit herself so. So then he went home and said to his wife that the hare wouldn’t be coming around anymore.
