An old Norwegian came to Kristen Blære’s in Kras, that’s out on the southern side of Nørlund forest. He was the forest ranger there and his wife tells the Norwegian no, she wouldn’t give him lodgings, there were so many who wandering about, one out and the next one in. Then he had to go out into the woods again. Then the husband saw him when he went home and asked him who he was. Well, he was an old beggar who wanted lodgings. When the forest ranger now comes into his wife he tells her to have one of the girls go get him, it was a pity that he should go out there in the forest and freeze to death. So he was allowed to stay there. They had so many mice and the forest ranger said that he didn’t really know where he could put his bag down. Well, he wasn’t scared of those guys. The next morning it turned out that they’d bit a hole in his bag anyway. Then he ask Kristen Blære if he wants them shown away because he’d do him that favor in return. Sure, he’d like that a lot. Did he have any enemies he wanted them to be shown to? No he didn’t, he didn’t want to visit such harm on anyone, because he thought they’d had a hard enough time with them. Then they all came running and there were so many of them, it was horrible, and then he put them under an osier bush and they ate that all winter. They also say that a couple of mice came running out across the floor and wanted to run in another hole and then the Norwegian said, “Don't bend over, don't bend over, you didn’t bend over last night when you bit my bag.”
