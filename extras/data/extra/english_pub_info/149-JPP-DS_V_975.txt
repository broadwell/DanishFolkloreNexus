A man who lived at Åstrup mill, south and west of Hjørring, got sick and was going to die. He had eight hundred daler in a bag near his bed and before he died he told his wife that he wanted the money with him in his grave. The wife puts them in the casket too. Then the minister comes down there, when he was supposed to be buried, they called him Master Nielsen, and he was told about the money and said that it should be taken out otherwise he wouldn’t bury him, the dead man couldn’t have the money with him. So the corpse is buried but then they couldn’t stay down there at Åstrup at night, a big black dog came in and tipped over the beds with them in them, and had nearly torn them apart. So they sent for the minister and he came down there and changed things, he conjured him down half way out on the mill dam under a big heavy stone. Kristen Måjen’s mother worked for that minister, so it isn’t so long ago. His casket is in Hjørring church.
