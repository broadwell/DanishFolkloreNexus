For modsot (a disease characterized by exhaustion), it is normal to let oneself be measured. Last year I met an old woman who had been weak for quite a while on the way to Søvind. It surprised me to see her so far from home and I asked her where she’d been. “Out to visit the Bødker woman in Søvind to get measured for modsot.” I asked how that was done, and she told me that the woman measured her with a thread: a) from head to toe, b) around her waist, c) down her left arm, and then she bound a knot on the thread and then tied it to her left leg where it was to stay for three days.
