In a farm up in Sjællands odde, about forty years ago, there was really bad haunting. Once the people had a little foal which stood in a little barn and it was exactly there that the haunting was the worst. They noticed now that in the barn there was a little nook that both the mare and the foal avoided quite precisely, and it was also impossible for people to chase the animals into it. The people thought that something must be hidden in that nook because of things that weren’t quite right there. So they broke up the floor and dug down in the ground where they found a human skeleton. They gathered the bones together and carried them up to the cemetery and buried them there and since that time there has never been a haunting in the farm.
