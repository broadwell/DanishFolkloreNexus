There were some people who lived in Gudhjem right below a cliff, and they had a daughter who sang beautifully. She sang psalms so one could hear them far away, and that had also delighted the underground dwellers; they wanted to bring her home to themselves and they also were lucky enough to steal her. She disappeared all at once, and since then they could hear her sing in HÃ¥rkaraklippen, that's a big cliff down by the sea.
