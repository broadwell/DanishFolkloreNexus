They dug up a skeleton at Astrup cemetery and there was long hair on its head. He was put up against the churchâ€™s wall and people called him Skaris. He was supposed to lean up against the wall, and everybody who had committed an offense had to go up and kiss him. Then there was a daring farmhand from the town who wanted to go up and give him a sandwich, but then Skaris jumps on his back and rides him down through the town. When they got down to the east, past the town, then Skaris flew off of him and into a house, and then there was a huge row in the house. Skaris disappeared completely in there, there was nothing to see of him in there. After that time, there was haunting in that house. It was later torn down since nobody wanted it, and the garden was later attached to a farm.
