In Em in Mors there was a revenant that walked out in the fields and they couldn’t keep their farm animals calm because of it. It went so far that the revenant sometimes came into the farm at sunset. Then the farmer went to the minister in Øster Assels and he came and told his farmhand to drive him over there. Next he showed him a place where he was supposed to wait and he was supposed to stay at that place until the minister came again, however long that was. While the farmhand waited, he thought he heard the minister complaining. Then the moon rose and he could see that the minister lay on the ground a little bit away. He went over and called to him. The minister said that that was bad for him. “Now I’m lost.” With that he got up and drove with the farmhand home and the next day he drowned himself in a marl pit out in the back yard.
