When I lived in a house out in the Haarup woods—Krannestrup, my little boy Martinus lay one night and was really agitated. I though that he wanted to pee and reached out for him but my hand grabbed a snake instead. Then I jumped up and got the kids out of the bed and out into the kitchen, and then I killed the viper. It was so slippery, so slippery and I think it had been biting my son, because he’d been sick for three days, and he could otherwise eat a lot in those days. The man who owned the house came the next day and I showed him the snake. “Shit,” he said, “I’ve lain between both grass snakes and vipers, are you scared of that?” I was scared stiff and said that I wouldn’t continue to live in that house. That was the first Sunday after Saint Hans, but then in September I had my son Kristian. He lived to be only twenty weeks old and then he died of the shakes (cramps), and it was probably because of what came over me the night that I killed the viper.
