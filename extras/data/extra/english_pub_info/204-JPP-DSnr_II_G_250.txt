A man named Klavs owned Tornby-Bjærg and he had a farmhand who was called Jens. So one morning he says to him that he should go out and break stones up on the mountain and so he did. Now after he’d broken a number of stones he gets to a big flat stone and when he picked it up he found a burial chamber underneath it. Then he noticed that there was an old man sitting down there sleeping with his arms around a chest. It was Holger Danske and he wakes up and says to the farmhand, “Give me your finger, I want to feel if there’s still power in the Danish blood.” Then he gives him a metal rod and he crushes it to pieces. Well, it isn’t too bad yet he says, the Dane’s still have some bone, and then he said that the chest he was sitting on was filled with money and it was to be used to buy Denmark back when it fell into enemy hands.
