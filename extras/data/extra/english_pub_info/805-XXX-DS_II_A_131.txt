A farmhand told me the following: His father worked in Tøjstrup and at that time the woods went all the way down to Tøjstrup town, now there’s practically a mile up to it. There in the woods there were elves who had hollow backs. They often came to him when he was a shepherd, and they wanted to steal his sandwich from him, that’s what they were after. They also went into town and they were bad about stealing down there and taking their cats. It was said that they ate them. People had to be careful that their cats weren’t alone in the living room because otherwise they’d snatch them.
