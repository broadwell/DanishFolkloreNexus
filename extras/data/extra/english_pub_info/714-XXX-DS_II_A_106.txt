Old Johanne said that there were elves in Havreballe forest. A farmhand, who was out looking for some cattle one afternoon, came across them and they danced with him, and he went down to them every day at a specific time and he showed people where he went down. It was an elm root. But when he was at home, he was really strange and he couldnâ€™t get his act together. They needed three priests to read for him, before they got him released from it. Then he was better after that time, but he had to watch out not to go out there anymore.
