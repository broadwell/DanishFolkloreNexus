Between Børglum town over to Vollerup town there is a big heath called Skrolles heath. Places are built around it, and in one of the places there is a nisse, who watches the man’s cows in the winter, so that they are much better than others’. But the nisse also wants pay for that, he wants a bowl of sweet porridge with butter in it, and if it happens that there is too little, then he takes a little revenge. One night when he came as usual to get his porridge, he didn’t find any butter in it and naturally got quite upset, and immediately decided to avenge himself. He went down into the barn and got hold of the biggest and best cow there was, took it by the horns and twisted its neck. After he’d sat and gloated over this a while, he decided he’d better eat all of the porridge after all. Then he found the butter at the bottom of the bowl, because it had been hidden by one of the girls to trick him a little bit. Then he really regretted what he’d done and decided to make it right again. He took the dead cow on his shoulders and walked with it across the heath to another big farm where he knew that there was a cow of the same size and just as good, and he took the live cow on his shoulders and carried it back. Then when he’d gotten it into the barn and tied up he complained bitterly about his back: “Owww my back, Skralles heath was long, and the red cow was so heavy, oww my back.” He said it so loud that the people down in the farm could hear it.
