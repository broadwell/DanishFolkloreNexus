There was a curate in Serridslev, he was called Jermiin and lived in the annex farm. Then the big Vildmose had caught fire and there had never been a swamp fire like that in Vendsyssel before. It burned both winter and summer and burned for nine or ten years. Jermiin said then that he could stop the fire easily, he could be at home in the parsonage and stop the fire but he didn't want to because then people would think he was involved with witchcraft. But now they could drive with him up to the fire. They did that too and he sat in the wagon and drove around the fire. Then it was put out. Then there was a theft in Vrå church, and the thieves stole both the chalice and the drinking vessels and everything. Now there was a rural dean in Vrå at that time, and he wanted the stolen goods to be “shown again,” and Jermiin was to do this, because he was so wise. The dean brought two ministers with him to the church to watch that he showed it again. As they went in there, Jermiin says that now he’d show them something they'd never seen before and that they’d never want to see again. At that time, they had leaded windows in the church just like at other places and so he took a needle and went and poked three holes in the lead. Next, he advised them that they should notice the thieves and see if they could recognize them, there were three who had done it, and all three were to go through the holes in the window lead. The dean and the two ministers got really scared by that sight. The dean said that he wished never to see it again. He knew all three thieves and it was three cotters from Vrå parish. I also heard their names, because Maline from Øksenvad who the dean had confirmed knew them personally and she told me that. But they got all of their silver back again.
