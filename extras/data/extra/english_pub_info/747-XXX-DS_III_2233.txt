My mother wanted to go from Vole to Flensted in foggy weather. Then she got lost, and then she came to a stone with red letters on it, but she couldn’t read them. Then my mother’s brother Jens Mikkelsen was watching sheep on the same field. One day he finds a hole down into the ground, and when he stretches his staff down into the hole, there is something that clinks, just like it could be silver coins. So now he wants to check it out, but first he wanted to make sure that the sheep didn’t wander into harm, and when he saw that he’d have to go out and meet them, he left his staff in the hole, and his clogs next to it. When he got back, he couldn’t find any of the things. The ground where this happened is called Korsbakken. In the same field there was a flat stone, which was about thirty inches on each side, and there was a couple of inches of sod on top of it. I could just scrape over it with the plow. I never looked at it, but it was easy to see where it was, because during the summer when everything was covered with grass, the grass on it died. Finally I came to think about that, there was this one time I heard a lot of talk about a treasure, and so I wanted to check the stone out, but then we couldn’t find it. It had sunk down. I’ve dug for it later but I’ve never been able to find it. It’ll probably come to light at some point, but it's possible that the person who is supposed to find it hasn’t been born yet.
