Peder Hjort, Skjærslipper-Lassen and Bitte-Fanden plundered a man’s house over in Ersted. They came in through a window. The wife escaped out of her bed and slipped right through their legs. They got a hold of her kerchief and they bound her hands with it, but didn’t pay attention to whether they did so in the front or not. They grabbed her by the neck and banged her three times against the floor and then said, “Now she’s had enough.” They’d baked the day before, and the breads were lying on the bench in front of the table, but they’d fallen when the robbers had climbed in through the window, and so there she lay among the breads and she got her hands free and crept about and got out in only her nightshirt. Then she ran over the ice in her bare feet to a man who lived a bit to the south. Her husband who was in bed they beat up. They’d taken a fencepost and they beat him with it so both skin and hair hung off of it. There were no fewer than thirty-six stab wounds in his thigh. They wanted to tie his hands behind his back but couldn't in part because he was too strong and in part because his arms were too stiff, they couldn’t be bent. Then they discovered that the wife was gone, and so they got busy looking for money and wanted to get out of there. There were two wallets which were on each their side in the closet and they were both as thick as psalm books, and they weren’t locked. The robbers shook the money out of one of the wallets and flung it away and they took the other one with them. Then they ran off. One of them got dizzy along the way and they were going to cut his throat so he wouldn’t tell on them, but then another one got a hold of him and slapped him to his senses.
