A girl had gotten pregnant. She decided that when she was going to give birth that she would kill the child. When the time came for her to have the child, she took her mistress with her out in the barn. Here she had the baby without any pain, and then the woman says, "Lay the child by your right breast before you kill it." The girl did that, and then she couldn't kill the child. Then the woman and the girl both saw a black cock jump up on a support beam and crow, "If I'd known that, then I wouldn't have held your back as well as I did."
