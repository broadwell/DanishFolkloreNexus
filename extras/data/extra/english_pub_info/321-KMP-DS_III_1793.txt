Part of the old fjord arm, of which Kolund sound was the last part, once  reached all the way up to Torsager and one knows that, in the olden days, it was possible to sail all the way up there. Just north of the school, they’ve found a lot of old mooring posts, chopped so that they are square, and north of the town there’s a large meadow that’s called Medkjær harbor where they found an old boat a couple of years ago. But it was in such bad condition it couldn’t be brought up. They also found a ship’s anchor in that same meadow.  A road in town was called Skipper Street, now it’s called Pludderen.
