There was a revenant one place who was to be conjured, and he was so dangerous walking again. So there were three ministers to do it, and they were gathered together and they each sat with a candle at a table. Then a curate comes in, he'd heard about this, and he sat down next to them. Then he asked if they thought that they could take care of him. Then they looked at him and laughed, they thought that they were much more studied than him. Then he cut three pegs and he put them over the door. Then when he had sat for a little while, the first peg tumbled down. “Now he's getting up out of the grave,” said the curate. A little later the second peg fell down. “Now he's on the way.” Then the third peg fell down. “Now he's here.” All at once he came in the door and then he went about to the others and blew their candles out, but he couldn't blow his candle out. Then the curate says to him: “Follow me down here to the barn to see if the cows are tied up.” “No, there's nothing for us to do out there. You've also stolen once.” “Well, I didn't do that for the sake of abundance, but out of need and necessity.” And then he flung a bread roll right into his mouth. “Follow me now.” “Well, lets go then, Per Fæbinder (Cow binder).” Ever since then, the curate had that name. Then he followed him out and then he was conjured down there in the barn.
