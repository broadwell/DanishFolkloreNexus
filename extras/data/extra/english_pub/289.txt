The minister's wife in Haslum died and then she was to be placed in the church the night before she was to be buried, that was the custom at the time. But then the parish clerk sneaked in there with his lantern, because he wanted to steal a gold ring she had on her little finger; but he couldn't get it off of her and so he took his knife and wanted to cut her finger off with it. Then she came to life and said: “Ow, my little finger!” When the parish clerk heard that, he got scared to death and ran, and they neither heard from him nor saw him again. The minister's wife took the lantern and walked home. She saw that there was light in the kitchen, because the girls were there and busying about late that night, and so she went over to the window and asked them to let her in. They ran in to the minister and said to him: “The lady was here.”—“Oh children, that's not true,” he answered. “Yes, it is,” they said. So the minister went out to them. “Oh dear papa let me in,” she said out there. “Oh dear mama go to your grave and lay down.”—“No, I'm quite alive, let me in.”—“Alas no,” he said again, “go to your grave and lay down.”—“For Christ's sake, let me in, I'm freezing to death.” Now the minister let her in and she told him how she had come to life and what the parish clerk had been up to. She had six children after that time, but her left side was never warm again.
