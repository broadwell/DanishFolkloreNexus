Between Tjærborg and Træsborg north of Vadgård and in Bondegård’s field lie Hellegård hill and Borregård hill. There used to be two forts there. The enemies attacked the man at the last one and stabbed him to death until his innards ran out. Then he said: “Now it's best, little children, that you make an end of it.” His wife was called Buurgier, and she followed them outside when they left. When they came out, they wiped off their bloody daggers in her apron. Then they took the road towards Hellegård. They came across some shepherds who fled. The farmer fled from them too out into a stone pile. “Is the fox in here?” they yelled, and stuck their spears into the pile and stabbed him to death. That’s how Hellegård fell, and the hill is named after him even now.
