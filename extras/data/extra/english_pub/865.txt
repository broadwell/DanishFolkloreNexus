When I was a little boy, I often heard tell of the nightraven, but I never saw it. The men went and got heather far away, and it had  often gotten quite late before they got home. It was during the summer late at night one time that I went past a man who was going to get heather. Then we hear a bird that came from far out to the west and swung right in over us and it said, "Baw-u-u! baw-u-u!" so it echoed in the air. Another bird came after it that had more of a peep in its voice. "What was that?" I say. "Don't worry about it," he says. "That's the nightraven." -- "I'm not worrying about it, I'm just asking about it." Later I heard the old peoples' stories, that all of those who committed suicide were to be buried in a T-shaped field divide, and they had to dig them or throw them a grain of sand each year, and after many years they come up and fly off toward the holy grave, but they could only fly a certain distance each year. It could take many hundreds of years before they reached it.
