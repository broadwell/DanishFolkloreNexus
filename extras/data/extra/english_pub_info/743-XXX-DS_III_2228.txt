Old Ulv went and took care of the town’s livestock. Then he came across a churn full of money, it was lying out in Store-mose (big swamp) or Gjedsbæk swamp. But he couldn’t carry it from there, so he put his clogs and his shepherd’s staff next to it, and went to Bække to get some people to help. When they came and wanted to go out there, they came across his clogs and staff by Bække mill. The money is still out there now, but it’ll be found someday and then belong to the family of the man who first found it.
