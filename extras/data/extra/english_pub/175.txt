There was a guy who was called Svend and he lived at a farm in Lørslev, it's gone now. One day he was up here near Ilbjærge plowing, and he had four animals before the plow. The boy drove two of the animals and the father was plowing. When they had plowed for a while, the boy says, "Hey, Father, Father." -- "What is it?" says the father. "Is there fire where there's smoke?" -- "Yes there is," says the father. "Well then," boy could he ever swear, "the gray nag has caught fire." They plow another two or three times across the field again. When they come past a little mound that was out on the field--it's called Byghøj, but it's been practically plowed under and it'll soon be gone--a hand reaches up from the mound with a broken peel board. The man had his plow axe and some nails and so he took it and repaired it. When it was done, he puts it down where he'd gotten it and it immediately disappeared. He goes home at noon and comes back in the afternoon. Immediately, a hand pops up out of the mound holding a white plate with a fresh warm piece of buttered bread and he stopped and started eating it. But the boy wouldn't eat any. It was good for the man, but the boy became thin and died before the autumn.
