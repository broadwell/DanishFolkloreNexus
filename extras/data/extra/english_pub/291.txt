[A poor woman, who they called Svine-Karen, often came to beg at Nielstrup. One time she came to my great-grandparents’ parents and she was going about with a little child. The farm wife also had a child, and since she wanted to go to Randers, Karen says, “I can stay here and nurse your child in the meantime.” She stayed there that day and took care of the child. But later, when my great grandfather got bigger, the other boys would tease him and they said, “You’ve seen Svine-Karen’s watterpatter.” He’d get so angry about that.]

Another time she came to Søndergård, where my great grandparents’ parents lived and asked to stay the night there, and she was given permission to do so. Then she said to the farm wife, “Can I cook some porridge and bake some pancakes that I can take with me tomorrow because I can’t chew bread?” She was given permission to do that as well. When she was done, she went out to a feed box, where she was going to lie that night, and she got a comforter and some sheets she was going to have over her. The farmer was out feeding the animals when she’d settled in, and then he heard how she prayed to Our Lord: “Oh sweet little Jesus, you should come and take me now, the world has abandoned me and humanity has abandoned me and now you can come and take me in the name of Jesus.” Then the man came in and said to his wife: “Now Svine-Karen will never be homeless again, because you should have heard how she just prayed to Our Lord tonight.” The wife agreed, but when they got up the next morning, Svine-Karen was lying there dead.
