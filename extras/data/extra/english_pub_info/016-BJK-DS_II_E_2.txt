Down here a little north and east of Torstedlund, there’s a hollow they call Sørvad. One day, Lavst Gammelholm is walking down there and he sees the most horrible lindorm in front of him on the road; there was a stone wall on either side of the road, and the snake could reach from the one wall to the other. Now he’d heard that it had been predicted that a lindorm was supposed to come up in Ersted wælder--that’s in the woods near what they call Ersted swamp, but it’s not part of Ersted now, because the huntsmaster sold the farms when he took over the meadows--and when Lavst sees the snake, he goes back and tells others about it, and then the district judge, he was called Knud Teil, and his scribe went up there with their guns and wanted to kill this here snake as they believed it was there, since it was a man like Lavst Gammelholm who’d told them about it--but it was gone.
