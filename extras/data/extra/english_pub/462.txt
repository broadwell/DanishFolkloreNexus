When the plague raged in Ust, they believed that it was a revenge against the parish, and they sought advice for this. They were told that the disease couldn’t be stopped unless a child was buried alive. So they were supposed to cast lots for who should provide the child. But instead they bought a poor child for that purpose. The child was put down in the grave with a sandwich in its hand, and then they began to toss dirt on it. Then the child said: "You’re throwing dirt on my sandwich," and that was the last they heard from the child.
