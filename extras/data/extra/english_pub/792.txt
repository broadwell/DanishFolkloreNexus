Once a mill near DÃ¸rup burned and a girl got burned in there and they said that she walked again. Every night there was a great spectacle in the out lying farm buildings and noise in the farm, and then a big black dog ran through the barn. A joiner who was sleeping in a room saw the dog come along a thin plank and wondered quite a bit about that. People had also seen the miller come out with a lantern in his hand. In the end he wound up selling the farm because of the dog. They said that the miller had burned the mill himself and it was his fault that the girl was burned in.
