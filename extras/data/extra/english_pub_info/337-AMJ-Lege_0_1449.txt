Marri sat on the church stone, she sat and braided and prayed to God, the rain should stop, so the rain stopped, then the sun shone upon Marie’s bare knees, clear up you clouds, let the rainbow shine. Dear God pray for the poor man, who has no spoon to eat with, my wagon has tipped over, my tar has spilled, my cow’s name is Met, she lives in Skræp, she is born in a mill and buried in a clay pit, no other priest than a short-tailed horse, no other parish clerk than a short-tailed ram.
