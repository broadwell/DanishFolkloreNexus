Jens Langkniv (Longknife) lived in Dalstrup in Harre. A man from Harre had gotten lost while driving and had gone into a forest. Then he saw a light and he drove towards it. Then he came to a house and he went in there. But there was Jens Langkniv, and he could tell that things were wrong. Then he said: "I've apparently come to the wrong house."--"Yes, me too," said Jens Langkniv. "I'd like to know where the correct road away from here is, since I certainly don't belong here." Jens Langkniv complained just as bitterly as the man. Then he shows him the right road. "Now you need to drive as fast as you can, and I'll go in and talk to them." Jens did that too, and the other man got safely home, and he told them at home how he'd been in with Jens Langkniv there and had gotten safely away. But it was because it was his neighbor. Otherwise Jens Langkniv was in league with the other robbers.
