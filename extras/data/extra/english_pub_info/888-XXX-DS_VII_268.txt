A witch lived over on Katrup mark. She was a little lame, and she'd gotten that by being shot with a silver button when she was in the shape of a hare. People didn't dare loan her anything that could be turned, like a churn, sieve or measure, because then they thought that she could take their butter from the cream, so they wouldn't be able to churn. She could take milk by milking at home.
