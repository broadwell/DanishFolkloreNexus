When the district bailiff from Harris died, there was some talk about him walking again and they say that on the day of the funeral he arrived at his house before the funeral procession. That same night, there was a loud knock at the door of the parsonage in Brede, and the serving girl opened the door, but nobody was there. There was a second knock, even louder than the first but, once again, there was nobody there. Then the minister said to the girl: “If there is a third knock, I’ll go out myself.” Soon there was a louder knock than before, and the minister went to open the door himself, and the girl, who was listening, recognized the bailiff’s voice who said: “My case has been lost.” His riding horse which had been sold was found almost every morning covered with foam from the nightly ride, which it was used for by its earlier owner.
