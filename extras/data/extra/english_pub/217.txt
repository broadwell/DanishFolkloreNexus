There was a manor lord at Kjølske who was called Ole Lånng, and he had swine out in the woods, because at that time there was a big woods at Kjølske. There were a lot of swine, and there was also a swineherd with them. But one day the swineherd and the swine disappeared, and the manor lord and his people looked in the woods and to the south, north, east and west, but they could find neither swineherd nor swine. It was like this for four months, and then the manor lord and his wife went for a walk in the woods, and then they heard what it was. Then the manor lord says to his wife, “My swineherd isn’t dead yet, I can hear him playing.” Then the swineherd played like this, “Wolle Lånng, Wolle Lånng, your swineherd has been taken prisoner, all of your swine have been slaughtered, except for the big spotted sow, and they’re taking her now, they’re taking her now.” When the manor lord came home to the farm he calls for the his barn master and two or three farmhands jump up on horses and go out to ask all of the inhabitants of Hallund parish for help, they were leaseholders at that time, and they were to meet at the farm the next morning at 5, and then they were to go out and look in the woods. But they searched the woods three times before they found the robbers’ den. It was all the way down in the ground, and there was a huge birch bush over it and they could pull it back and forth and pull it over the entrance so that nobody could find it. The robbers were all gathered down there in the den and there was one person who was known from the area who was pretending to be a butcher. They’d driven about and sold all the pork from his swine except for this one spotted sow which had just been slaughtered. The swineherd hadn’t been hurt and he came to Kjølske again, but the robbers were all imprisoned and executed. The robbers’ den can still be seen to remind people about that, it's on a farmer’s field in Hallund, he’s called Lars Laden.
