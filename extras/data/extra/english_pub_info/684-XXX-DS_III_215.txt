Karby church has two bells because from the very beginning it was decided it was to be a market town. When the church was finished and they began to ring the bells, the trolls became so angry and upset that they wanted to tear down the church immediately, but they didn't have the power to do that. They were now going to start building a harbor, but the trolls got their revenge there, because no matter how hard people worked during the day, it was destroyed at night, so it was impossible for them to get a harbor and that's why Karby became what it is today, namely a small rural town.
