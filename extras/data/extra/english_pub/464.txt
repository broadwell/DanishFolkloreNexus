When Højslev church was to be built, what they built during the day was torn down at night. It was discovered that the mound man, who lived nearby, did it and the workers made the deal with him that he should build the church and also put in as much gold and silver somewhere in it so that it could be rebuilt if it burned down or got destroyed, and then he’d get both the first and the last bride who were married in the church. He’s got the first bride. When they drove to the church, they watched out carefully for her and she also got home OK, but when she took the bridal wreath off her head, the mound man got the power to take her. She came to live with him but every day she went to a spring and fetched water. Her father spoke with her and wanted to free her but she answered that she was happy enough where she was. The path where the mound man walked with her is always green both in summer and winter, and on the north side of the church there is a stone on which a little hat is carved and inside that lies the treasure with which the church is to be rebuilt. Once they tried to break open the stone but the attempt failed.
