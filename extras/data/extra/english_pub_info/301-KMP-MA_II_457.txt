Down here in Amaliegård forest there was a cooper. He was very funny and he told a story about how he’d become lame. He’d gone to Randers one day and then gone through Kristrup. The tailors were having a dance there and he wanted to go in and dance with them. They were so light that they were dancing on a paper ceiling, but it couldn’t hold him, and so he fell right through and broke his thigh. Since then he’d been lame.
