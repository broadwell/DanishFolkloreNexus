One time my father wanted to go to town, he ran into a really big fox that rubbed up against his legs. It wasn’t a real fox, and it wanted him to follow it to Katsåendet [Katsandet], there was a pond in the town called that. Then the fox wanted to push him down there, but he asked to be allowed to go free. When he was on his way home, a big sow came up to him; it was the size of a horse. He got so scared because it was so frightening, then it became so little that it wasn’t bigger than a corpse lamb. It wanted to follow him up to the church gate, he lived right across from the cemetery and then it disappeared there.
