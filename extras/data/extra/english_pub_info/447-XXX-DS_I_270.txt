Once when I was driving from Kalundborg, I'd almost gotten to bridge at Ã…gerup mill, and it was dark as pitch. Then I noticed that something was sparkling down by the bridge. "That's good," I thought, "now I can get my pipe lit." I thought that it was possibly people who were smoking. So I gave the horses a whack and soon reached the bridge. Well, it was right enough that it was someone smoking, but it wasn't people. They were small little ones with dark sweaters and white pants, and each one of them had a silver plated pipe. They were puffing away and when the fire sparked I could see them well. They were walking along the side of the road, one behind the other, and they were presumably going to a party in a mound near there. I said good evening, but they didn't answer, and I didn't dare ask them for a light for my pipe, the horses were snorting and restless, and I let them run, so it didn't take long before I got away from that devilishness. But I wasn't really happy until I got home to mom.
