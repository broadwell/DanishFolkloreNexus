The witches rode to Bloksbjærg on Midsummer night on oven rake shafts. The hag in one farm said, "Fluks over all the treetops." The farmhand at the farm wanted to follow her, but he hadn't heard correctly, and said, "Fluks through all the treetops." That's why he got badly scratched up before he got to Bloksbjærg.
