My father was born on Whitsunday itself, and he could see all sorts of stuff. By Kattesund, a pond in the middle of Skjødstrup, he saw a fox one evening that went from it up to the church. There were many who saw that, because that’s where it tended to wander. He could also see the corpse lamb that went and tapped on the doors where somebody was to die.
