One time the people in Lørslev, in Ugilt parish, wanted to dig Stovhøj out, it's over in Ilbjærge. They had seen a dragon rise up over the mound at night from time to time, surrounded by flames. They came to a chest, and immediately all the men began lifting it. Finally they had it at the edge of the pit, but a woman who was also along was careless enough to shout: "Hold on tight now." At the same moment, the chest fell out of their grip, and they only held on to one of the handles. From the dragon they now heard a voice: 
"Now I am thirty feet down in the ground. 
If I can't  stay in Stovhøj, 
then you will never get me up out of Sørup lake." 
That lake lies about a mile southwest of Tårs church. During bad weather, the dragon could be seen in the lake like a lightning bolt.
