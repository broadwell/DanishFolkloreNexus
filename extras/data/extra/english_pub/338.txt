There isn’t the palatalization here. R is unvoiced, but is starting to come forward just as the soft d is coming forward. Twenty-five years ago it was impossible to get children to say a soft d, but now they say it immediately. Søren, go out in the barn, to take the spade, to go out in the field, to start raining, we need to fix the roof tomorrow. This is how they said it in Skjødstrup and Krajbjerg (r is pronounced somewhat back in the throat). Mejlby: Stengel, gøng, fløng, kjern, bes, skødder, Knop. Gang kjern bæjs.
