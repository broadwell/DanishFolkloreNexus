If you take a bucket of cold water and throw it on a person who is tormented by nightmares, the moment that he is plagued by it, then the lover will become visible, and then one can gladly discover who it is. There's a story about a queen who loved horses. In particular, she had one horse that was the dearest of all to her, and she was busy with it both awake and asleep. The stall hand noticed that things weren't right with the horse, and he thought it was ridden by a mare. So he grabbed a bucket of water and threw it on it, and see: now the queen was sitting on its back.
