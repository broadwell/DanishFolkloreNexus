In the woods on Bogø, the people’s cattle grazed in common, and when the maids who went out together to milk had milked their cows, they called to each other to walk home together. But one day when they were going to go home, one of the girls was missing and she wouldn’t answer no matter how much they called. Finally they walked around to try and find her and they found her finally sitting in an alder swamp quite confused. They managed with great difficulty to get her home and there she told them that a wonderfully nice man had come to her by the alder swamp and asked her if she would be his lover, and with his speech he’d entranced her so she couldn’t get away from him. He had also entranced her so she couldn’t answer when the other girls called to her. After that, she had to go down to the alder swamp each time, but one time somebody advised her that when the elf king came again she should say to him three times, “Turn around so I can see if your back is the same as your front.” She did that the next time and when she now saw that he was hollow in the back, she cried: “No, damn it, you’re as hollow as a dough trough!” at which point he deserted her and, after that time, she had peace from him.
