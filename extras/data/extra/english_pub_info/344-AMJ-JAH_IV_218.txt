You probably know Kirsten, I was there when her daughter got married. It was a really nice wedding, and it was over in Randers. Kirsten gave her daughter a velvet blouse and a homespun shirt. When she put the velvet blouse over the homespun shirt, she was so pretty. When I got to Randers, there were some carriages driving by, so I didn’t know how I was going to get in to where they were holding the wedding. But then there was a servant who took my hand and, zip, I was inside. Then we drove up Store Gade (Big Street) and down Bitte Gade (Tiny Street), until the hats and the caps whirred past my eyes and I got as dizzy as a hen. Then we get into the church. Then when we got home again, we all sat down at the table and got something to eat. They poured, and I drank, and it went like that for quite a while. But then my daughter Sine came, “It isn’t good, the way you’re sitting there drinking mother,: -- “Don’t worry, I’ll reach my goal,” I said.
