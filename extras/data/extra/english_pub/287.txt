An old woman in Nielstrup, she was called Ma’ Røgters, was known as a witch. Søndergård lay down below it and during the harvest their son drove and loaded grain up on their heath. Then he had to go past her house with a load and every time he came past and drove down the path to the farm, he tipped over. This happened for the first five loads. Then he took his whip and headed over to her place, while he said, “She’s to blame for all these problems, that Ma’ Røgter, since she’s the one doing this.” When he got up to her, he said, “If you do this more today, then I’ll beat you so that blood will flow about you.”—“Oh, little Niels,” she began whining , “if you’ll leave me alone, then you won’t tip over anymore today.” Then he went back and he didn’t tip over any more.
