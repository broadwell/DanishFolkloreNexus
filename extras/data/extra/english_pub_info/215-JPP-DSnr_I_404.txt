There was a man over in Horne called Mikkel, he was used to always losing a lot of his cattle. One day he started driving peat from a mound he had on his field back home to his dung heap. But the night after, when he’d already driven quite a few loads during the day, something comes to his window and shouts, “Miggel, Miggel.” He answers, “Yes, what is it?” Well, he needed to thatch their house again, the one he’d taken the roof off of during the day, since they were freezing. No, he answers, he hadn’t done that, he hadn’t taken the roof off of anyone’s house. Yes, he’d taken peat from the hill. Well, he says, he wouldn’t bring the peat back, since he paid taxes and rent for the mound just as for his other property. Well, he’d better thatch their house again, otherwise it would go bad for him. The next morning he started driving some of it back to the mound again, and he leveled it and brought it back into shape. After that, every morning when he got up, there was a little hole in the window, just big enough for a four shilling piece to fit through, and every morning there was a four shilling piece in the window. That was to cover his expenses with the mound. About three or four days later, he was taking his afternoon nap, and someone comes to the window and shouts, “Miggel, Miggel, your foal is standing a bit to the north here, and has gotten tangled in its harness, and it is dying.” He jumped up in a hurry and saved the horse, and it got better even though it was really in bad shape. A little later he had yet another foal that had run into problems, it had fallen down into a ditch and was lying on its back and was just about dead. They came and told him that too, and it went on like this, and so after that time he never lost any horses, cows or anything, since he always was told when something was wrong.
