A peddler arrived at Klode mill and went about there and was in the area for several days. It was an elderly couple who lived there. The girl got suspicious of him since he wandered about and looked so closely at everything, and one day when he got his knife sharpened they started to think the worst. Therefore they kept a watch out, and the miller’s wife had an axe nearby at night, and her husband had a knife. One night he broke in and wanted to kill them. The husband got exactly what he had coming, but the wife called out for the farmhand, even though they didn’t have one, to attack the robber so he got scared and jumped out of the upper door in the scullery. In his haste, he lost a silver button, and they found it. Then the other man took it around to various inns in the area and other such places that peddlers seek out. Finally he met the man who had the same buttons on his jacket. He talked to him and asked him if he wasn’t missing a button. No, he said, no. “Well, well let’s take a look, since here’s a match to those.” The others in the room helped him see, and he was missing one sure enough. Then he was grabbed and put out on a rack out there on the heath near the inn where he had killed the other man.
