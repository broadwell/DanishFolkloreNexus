There used to be talk that if a farmhand took the skin that the foal lies in when a mare foals (the placenta) and walks through it, he could turn into a wolf. There was a farmhand who had done it, and then he and his master were in the meadow haying. Then it came over him, and he turned into a wolf, and he went over and ripped the foal to death and tore a big part off of it. A little later he came back and turned into a farmhand again and lay down next to the master and complained that he didn’t feel good, at which point the man said: “No wonder, since you’ve torn my foal apart.” 
     They called this kind of an animal a werewolf. One probably has to do something more or say something rather than just crawling through that skin, but I don’t know what.
