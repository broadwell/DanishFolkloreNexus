Many years ago, a manor lord lived at Grovballegård in Svostrup, and he was bad about tormenting his peasants. After a while, he died and on the day of his funeral, his body was followed to the grave by an unusually large number of people who were all happy. But when the group came out of the church, their happiness turned into horror because on one of the stall doors sat the manor lord and he was crowing like a rooster. From that point on, things were really bad with haunting in the farm. Finally, they sent for the Grønbæk minister because he could conjure the ghost. He got it down in a swamp near the farm and rammed a post down through it. The post stood there for many years, and they say that when anyone rocked it, a voice from below would shout, "Rock it up better! Rock it up better!"
