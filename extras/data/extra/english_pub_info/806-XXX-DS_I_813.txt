A farmhand rode past the PÃ¸lse Mounds near Kalvehave one night. One of them was up on poles, etc. When he rode off with the cup, a voice shouted from the mound, "Oh, One Leg ran off and took Gold Leg with him!" Others say that one ran after him and shouted, "Stop, gelding," but the farmhand answered each time, "Run, whinnier!" He was barely inside his farmer's gates when they were right outside. Since he didn't dare keep the cup, he gave it to Kalvehave church.
