The body of a viper is good against poison and against tympanitis in cattle. That's why when the farmhands went to the swamp in the old days with the sharp peat shovel in their hand, they never hesitated to decapitate the vipers, they pulled the skin off it and put it up under their hatband, where it sat and wriggled until evening, because a snake doesn't die before sundown.
