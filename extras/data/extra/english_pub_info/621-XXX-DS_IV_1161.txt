A minister in Vislev (he lived at the end of the last century) drove home one night. All of a sudden the wagon wouldnâ€™t move. The minister said to the farm hand who was driving that he should get off and put one of the rear wheels up in the wagon. When this was done, they drove quickly home, and when they stopped in the parsonage, the minister told the farm hand to drive the wagon out into the duckpond and let it stand there. In the morning they saw that there was an old woman holding the wagon instead of the removed fourth wheel.
