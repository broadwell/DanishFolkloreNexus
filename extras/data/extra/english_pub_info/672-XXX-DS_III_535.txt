They were supposed to get a church bell here in Tåning, and it was sailed across the sea along with the bells for Ovsted and Tandrup. The ship ran into difficulty at sea, they probably had too big a cargo, and so they tossed the Tåning bell overboard. But the other two made it ashore and were hung in their steeples. The one in Tandrup is a massive bell and has a beautiful sound; they can hear it all the way to Elling. By the way, there have been two bells in Tandrup.
