A peddler was killed down here in Åsted, that’s not too far from here. They had sat and played cards with him and won a good deal of money from him, and so they wanted to get all of it from him but still be decent folk. They got him up to the mill and they got him into a bed but the mill people knew nothing about this. Later, they hung him in the same guestroom. The millers found the body but it wasn’t revealed who had done it until one of them, who lived in Tise, admitted it just before he died.
