Ersted water hole east of the town here is a big hole down in the ground, and when there’s a thaw, the water level reaches so high it flows from the pond down to there and then it can’t be stopped. When there's been frost and it has snowed for a long time, and then there comes a sudden thaw so that the water really gets going, then it can really run down there. Villads’s gander went down into the water hole and it came out again by Røde mill, about two kilometers from there. There’s an outlet from the underwater stream, but it runs all the time as if it were a stream and they call it Kjæn stiens.
