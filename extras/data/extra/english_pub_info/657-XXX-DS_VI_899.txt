Jens Plovgård lived at a place out by the western sea, maybe in Ramme, and he was a real genuine witch. One time there was a man over in Store-Ty who came to him because he had some pigs who had gotten away from him -- it was at the time when pigs were grazed. When he got there, Jens Plovgård wasn't home but his wife thought that he would come home that evening so he could wait, and she suggested that he go and lay down out in the barn. He goes down there too. During the night, Jens Plovgård comes home, and his wife told him about this man from Ty who had been there. But she doesn't tell him that he is out in the barn. So Jens Plovgård goes out to the barn too, and calls the Devil to him and asks him where the pigs had gotten off to. The Evil One tells him that his neighbor had killed them and buried them in a sand dune he had near the farm. The man from Ty lies there listening to this and then he thinks that he could just as well go home. But he didn't get all the way home, since Jens Plovgård had sent someone after him, and he had to go back and get the proper message from him.
