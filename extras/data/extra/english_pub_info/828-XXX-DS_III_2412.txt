There was old talk of a spade that was made with nine blows and when you put it down at night it would be moved to the place where gold is supposed to be buried and then you could dig it up. That kind of spade was made of wood and if there was a knot, it could remain and be used as a foot tread. You took a tree branch which could be used for that, and then you were supposed to cut three blows on it three Thursdays in a row, two blows in the front and one in the back each time, and when the three Thursdays had passed, and the nine blows finished, the blade was supposed to be finished. My father went to a man and wanted to have a spade like that made. Well, he’d do that. “But I have to cut the three blows each day in the name of Satan, and I’ll gladly do that. Then after that I’ll have to go to bed and get up for the three weeks in the name of the Devil." When my father heard that, he said: “I certainly don’t want to have you do that." So nothing became of that work.
