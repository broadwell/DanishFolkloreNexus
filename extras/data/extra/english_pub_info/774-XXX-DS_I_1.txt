Nisser and mound dwellers and things like that came into being because our Lord threw the evil angels down from heaven, and then some of them fell on mountains (bjærge) and hills, and they became bjærgmænd (mound dwellers); some fell in forests and swamps and they became elves, and those that fell down into buildings became nisser. They are small devils every one of them.            
     Where ever a farm had a nisse, they could always keep cattle and horses in good condition because the nisse went and stole from the neighbors and gave the food to his own farm’s animals.
