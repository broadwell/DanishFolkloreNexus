They say that Ida at Langesø haunted so bad after she'd died. She drove at night from Vigerslev cemetery where she was buried home to Langesø with four black horses with glowing tongues hanging out of their mouths. She had to go through Rue, but there was a man who lived there in the pump house who didn't like all this haunting and driving past his house at night. He spread bracken seeds on the road in front of his house so she couldn't drive over it. She couldn't get past it either, and then there was a huge tumult in the house so that they almost couldn't stay there, because she had to go through the house instead. Then the man didn't spread any bracken seed anymore, since it was worse when she had to go through the house than when she drove past. She continued with her nightly journey; but finally it got to be too bad there at Langesø, since she made such a commotion at the farm there at night that she was about to turn everything upside down. But then there was minister Balslev in Hårslev, he was so wise (cunning) that he could conjure. They got him to conjure Ida. He conjured her in Sortemose near Langesø. He had his books with him, but when he took the first one and wanted to start reading, she knocked it away from him, and the same thing happened with the next one he took, but she had to let him keep the third one. A post was then rammed down through her, and it is still out in the swamp to this day. If someone happens to knock into the post or rock it, then one hears a voice from below that says, "Rock hard." 
     They say that if there was a party and someone started talking about the workers and said that they were just as good people as them, then Lady Ida would say, "Even if all of the ecclesiastics allow the workers to go to Heaven, my son Jakob and I will not allow that."
