I've heard tell that an owner of Gisselfeldt or Bregentved had convinced a couple of men to take some earth from his garden and put it in their shoes and then go to another man's land that this manor lord wanted, and swear that they were standing on Gisselfeld earth. They didn't get any peace in their graves either, and they go about shouting, "Here is the proper boundary!" and they have to keep doing that until the unfairly won land is given back to its proper owner.
