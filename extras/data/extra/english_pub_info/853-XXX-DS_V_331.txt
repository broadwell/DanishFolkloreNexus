There is a farm in Tøving which is called Tinghøjgård and an old man used to live there, he went about dressed oddly, he always went about in old spotted leather pants and a big woolen sweater which hung and flopped about him, and finally an old round hat on his head. That same old man went and hanged himself, and ever since they said that he haunted at the farm and went about at the farm just as he had when he was alive. My grandfather got a lease on that farm. There was a really big living room, and in the back there were two beds which were paneled in, but in the front there was the door to the front room and the kitchen door right beside each other. My mother and their serving girl lay in one of the beds. Then it was night about midnight, and my mother was lying awake and the moon was shining in so she could see everything, then all of a sudden a shape came in through the door. She could clearly recognize that it was the old man, she had seen him many times and it was just like he walked and stood. She didn’t see the door open, but he went so quietly over the floor and looked around. She thought she could clearly hear that he sighed. Finally it went out the kitchen door. They could never keep their barn door closed at night and they could hear it banging regardless how often they closed it.
