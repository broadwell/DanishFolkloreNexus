They had a gaardbo (nisse) at Hvedsted, my mother’s grandmother remembered him. At that time they had wooden pitchforks, and when the farmhand went out and mucked the stalls in the morning, the gaardbo would sit up in the rafters with his feet hanging down. Then he gives the farmhand a box on the ears with one of his feet. Well the farmhand grabs the pitchfork and smacks the gaardbo’s foot with it. Then the gaardbo says, “I only got one, but you got three.” – “No,” says the farmhand, “Yeah, because there were three prongs on the pitchfork.” In the evening, when they came home, they left a harrow out in the courtyard, and the next morning they found the farmhand lying naked on the harrow and he was half frozen to death. The gaardbo had flipped the harrow over so the teeth pointed up and the farmhand lay there on the sharp teeth, and he got quite sick after that trip. The gaardbo had thrown a sleep plant on him so that he couldn’t wake up until the farmer came and called him.
