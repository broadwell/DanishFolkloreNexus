A cobbler in Andrup was bad to his wife and she decided to drown herself. They had three children and the littlest was in the crib. She went three times from the house to the lake, and finally she pulled her skirts up over her head, stamped a hole in the ice with her feet and put herself down. They could see by her her footprints how she had wandered back and forth, and the husband later said that if the child hadn’t been quiet, then she wouldn’t have done it. Later they often saw her revenant and heard her at Christmas time complain so loudly out there. Two sewing girls who walked across the lake on the ice met her with her skirt over her head and when they got to Glenstrup they got sick.
