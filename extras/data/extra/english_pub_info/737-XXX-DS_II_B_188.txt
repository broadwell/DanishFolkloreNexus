Jens Hårby at Hesthave had a very good relationship with the nisse. It was the custom to leave sweet porridge with lots of butter in it out on Christmas eve for him. Now there was a bit of mischief in Jens Hårby, and he pushes the butter all the way down to the bottom of the dish. Late at night, the nisse comes out to the porridge and he gets mad and he kills the best cow. After that he goes back to the porridge and finds the butter. Now he knew that there was a similar cow over in Mors, they looked exactly alike, and so he switches them. The girl couldn't tell the difference between the two when she went out to milk, but Jens Hårby could and he got the nisse to admit it. But they didn't suffer any loss, since it was a much better cow.
