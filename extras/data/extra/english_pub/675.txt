Not too many years ago, a man lived in Vendsyssel who went by the name “Hals minister.” It was said about him that he was gifted with foresight, he could see what there was inside a person and, as soon he saw that, he could say what would happen in the future. He was supposed to have said that he got his wisdom in the following way: When he was a little boy it happened one day that he came home hungry from the field and when he didn’t find any people at home, he went into the dining room by himself to make himself a sandwich. A small pot in which there was something wonderful that was standing on one of the shelves caught his eye, it was tasty and fatty, and he ate it on a piece of bread. But when his mother came home, she immediately missed the fat in the pot, she asked him if he’d eaten it, to which he answered yes. “You shouldn’t have done that,” and now she told him that the fat was a big white viper, it was the king of the vipers. 
     In the olden days, when there were far more vipers than there are now days, the shepherds who watched the cattle out on the bog often saw a viper nest. The vipers sat in there in an uncountable mass and stuck their heads into the air and in the middle of the flock there was one, much bigger than the others, with a white head and that was the viper king.
