One night, as a man passed by Store-Vårbjærg on Taftebjærg field, he saw that a whole group of little ones were dancing around the top of the mound. He went closer to watch their party, and now he also saw a number of large chests filled with gold and silver coins. The lids were open so that the money could be aired in the moon light. He wished he could have some of those coins, and when he saw his chance, he threw his knife into one of the chests. Quick as lightning, the little ones all disappeared with all of the other chests, but they left the one that he'd thrown his knife into. As they disappeared into the mound, they threatened him. He hurried back to get horses and a wagon and some men to help him drive the chest home. He didn't pay much attention to their threats, he didn't think a bunch of little ones could do anything to him, but the next morning when he went out into the barn, all of the cattle lay dead in their stalls.
