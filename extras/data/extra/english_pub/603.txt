There was a place that was also plagued with revenants, and so they assembled several ministers who were to read him down into the ground, but the revenant let the minister's hear about various sins they had committed. Then they got ahold of an old student, and the revenant reminded him of a theft. He answered, "The Baker wouldn't give me anything, and I did it so I could survive, as I was very hungry..." Then he conjured him down. Several years later, he came up out of the ground in the form of a night raven and flew out the window, and they haven't noticed him since.
