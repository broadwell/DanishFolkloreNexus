One night many years ago, I drove through Charlottenlund forest in Kragelund, and it was maybe around midnight. I had heard that there was haunting in the forest at night, but I didn’t worry about that, because people say so much. But now as I’m driving along, a coal black man comes out of the woods and throws himself under one of the back wheels, and then the wagon immediately stood completely still, the horses couldn’t budge it one step further. I had heard that when you turn the head harness on the horse, then the haunting has no more power; so I did that and it also helped because I drove along without seeing the black man anymore.
