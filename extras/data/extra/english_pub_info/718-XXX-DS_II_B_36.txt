A nisse lived in a farm in Kolby, he went and helped to take care of the animals, but one night, when he was feeding the horses, one of the horses kicked him. After that time, the horse got thinner and thinner, and the people in the farm couldnâ€™t understand why, since it was fed well. Finally they realize that nis might have a finger in the game and one night, after the farmhand had finished the feeding, he crept out into the barn. A little later, nis came along and took all the food away from the thin horse and carried it over to another as punishment because it had kicked him.
