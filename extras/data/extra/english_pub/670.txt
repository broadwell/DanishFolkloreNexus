Just as the sun had set, I saw in the southern part of the dale two human forms, a very big farmhand and a miserable little woman, who were walking west. He took hold of her and leaned over her and they plodded along like that. It got thick before my eyes and when it got lighter, I saw them. But what they were talking about, I don’t know. I went to the south right towards them but they continued off to the west. There was a thin layer of snow on the ground and I noticed immediately that my tracks were really clear in the snow but you couldn’t see theirs, and then I realized that it was some sort of evilness.
