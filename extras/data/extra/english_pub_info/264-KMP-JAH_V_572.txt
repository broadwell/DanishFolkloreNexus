A girl said that a couple often came to her father, who lived in Rejstrup, and asked to stay the night. The people brought some hay in and then they made a place for them on the floor in the living room. But when they woke up in the morning there were seventeen people there. There was one of them who always said, “God, let me be devoured by cancer.” My mother said that the last time she saw her, she was walking around with her finger in her larynx, that’s how much the cancer had eaten her, and when she’d drink, it would pour out of there.
