The children line up in a row, one behind the other and hold on tightly to each other. The last one is Marie, and one is a suitor. He comes up to the first one and asks: Where does Marie live? It is answered: Next one back (or: In Bethlehem in David’s city). He goes to the next one, and the same conversation takes place. Finally he comes to Marie and asks her just the same. She lives here! is answered with a voice that indicates that she has really experienced life’s hardships. Then he asks: Can I have one of your daughters to dance with? That would be quite hard, since she indicates that she needs them to help her card, spin, weave, etc, so she can’t do without her, but finally she says: If you promise me that she can get into heaven, then you can take her. He promises. Then the daughter comes up to the suitor with a tightly closed mouth, and he woos her in all sorts of ways, since it is all about getting to see her teeth. He asks how old she is, and she mumbles an answer, etc. If he manages to see her teeth, then she is going to hell, otherwise she’ll go to heaven. That’s how Marie gets rid of her daughters, one after the other, and they’re sent either to heaven or to hell. When she’s done with them, she is to go see her daughters. The ones that are in hell are having a really bad time, while the ones in heaven say: We’re doing so well, so well. If the last one is a boy, he’s not called Marie, but Joseph, and the suitor asks: Where does Joseph live? He asks him if he can have one of his boys to help him do carpentry work.
