My uncle had a pipe that had disappeared one day when they were out cutting clover. There were two farmhands doing that and when they went home at noon, he’d forgotten his pipe out in the field on a stone. When he got home he said, “Oh, now I’ve forgotten my pipe.”—“Oh, just let it lie there until we go back out there.” But when they got back out there, the pipe was gone. Then the other farmhand says, “You’d better go over to the cunning man tonight and get him to show it again.” That was Klemmen in Sorte-Mose. When he got out there and told him his errand, he said, “Well, don’t worry about a thing, when you get out there tomorrow afternoon, the pipe will be there.” That was right, too.
