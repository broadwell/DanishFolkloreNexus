There was a guy named Axel, my great grandfather remembered him, he always walked about naked except for his chest and back, where he wore a sheepskin. In the summer he spent a lot of time lying about in people’s scrap heaps sleeping. One afternoon, while he’s lying there sleeping, a little pussy cat comes and bites onto his big toe. Now he was a really big guy, almost like a giant. So now when he wakes up, the pussy cat really bites down hard and he said, “Garrehu! Garrehu!” That was the only thing he said, and then he crushed the pussy cat with one blow. You’d think he couldn’t really speak properly.
