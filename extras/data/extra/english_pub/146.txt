There was a man in Hjørring, he was a merchant and an innkeeper and he was called Niels Løt and his wife, she was called Karen. Then the old Skytte-Kræn had accused her of being a witch and Niels Løt summons him then, he had to prove what he said. They went to court. Then there was a big black dog that followed Niels Løt to the court. They ask Skytte-Kræn if he can prove that she’s a witch. Then he turns to this black dog and says, “Stand up, Karen, and answer that.” Then she stood there buck-naked in the middle of the courtroom with them. The man took off his chenille which he had on over his jacket and put it over his wife.
