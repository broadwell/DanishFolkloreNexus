The farms Nørholt and Brovang are in Skjærn parish. Many people had seen light on Nørholt’s fields, and it was common knowledge that there was a treasure buried there. The two men had often talked about making an attempt at finding it and one night one of them was supposed to stand in the courtyard of Nørhold while the other went after the light, and then blow a whistle when he reached it, since the light disappeared for the person who approached it, but shown just as clearly for the person who stood at a distance. Niels Brovang went with a staff in his hand and when he heard the whistle he planted the staff in the ground. A little after Niels Nørholt and his serving girl came with spades and shovels, and they began digging with great energy. Finally they banged into something hard, and it turned out to be the cover of a chest. One of them jumped down now and got hold of a shaggy dog. He wanted to run away because of fright, but the girl was more courageous, she took her scarf off her head and spread it on the grass, took off her apron and grabbed the dog with it. Then it said, when she had laid it on the scarf: “Because you took me so well and laid me down so softly, you shall have permission to take the treasure." Now she went down in the hole again and took hold of a can that was so heavy that she barely could lift it up. When they got home, it turned out that the can was full of gold coins. Then the two farmers split it amongst themselves and gave the girl a small sum for her hitherto unknown courage.
