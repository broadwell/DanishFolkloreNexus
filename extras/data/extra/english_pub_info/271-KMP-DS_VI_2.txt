There was a lot of talk in the old days of people who had a gjejst. There was a story like that about a farmhand in Nielstrup, they said he could go out in the stalls and sing and when the other farmhands came and wanted to go in there, then they thought he was there; but when they went into the house then he was sitting at the table there. Then they presumed that it was his gjejst theyâ€™d seen out there.
