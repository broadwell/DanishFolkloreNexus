A man over in Hajjbjøre wasn’t always crazy. One time he was in Rijjs and he was going to go to a milliner’s. He was wearing a large pair of clogs. He opens the door and sets his foot with this clog on it in. Then the milliner says, “Oh my, I’ve never anything like this.” Then he sets his other foot in also still with the clog on. “Well, here you’ve got something just like it.”
