There was a woman who had two doors on her house, one out to the south and one out to the north. The last door was on her kitchen (frammers) and when she’d been brewing, she’d opened both doors to cool off the beer and get the yeast in in good time. See, then Jon’s hunter and his dogs could come in, and they drank all her wort,  and then she had to give them a rye bread (grovkage) to get them to leave. The hunter was green and he had little puppies with red mouths along with him.
