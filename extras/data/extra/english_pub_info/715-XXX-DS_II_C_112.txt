The night raven is someone who has been conjured. There's supposed to be one who was conjured out here in Gunrderupg√•rd heath. I can't remember how many thousand rooster steps it is from the farm, but every year just before Christmas, there's a horrible noise and then it takes a step toward the farm. 
     There were three like that who followed along with each other one evening before Christmas, and then there's a horrible wail. Then they ask each other what it could possibly be, they couldn't understand it, and they ran as fast as they could. Then they come to a place and they go in and tell them about it, they couldn't figure out what it could possibly be. "You were lucky you didn't get in its way; it's a horrible thing, and many people have had problems with it." Then one of the farm hands asks what it is. That was the nightraven, he says. 
     Another one was knocked out cold so many times because he'd encountered it; he was the stable hand at the farm, and he'd told this here old man about it.
