My mother’s mother’s father was from Nysum Inn and had been off serving the king for eleven years. He was called Jens Smed. Then his mother dreamed that he was going to come home. She sat down one evening and began carding. Her husband said to her, “What, aren’t you going to bed?” – “No,” she says, “I’ll sit here until our Jens comes home.” He also came that same night, and they hadn’t heard from him in all those years, since they couldn’t write in those days.
     Yes, that innkeeper’s wife was a good dreamer. One time, some of her coins had disappeared, she needed some to give people change with when they bought a half pint at her place. Then she asks her husband if he’d taken her coins. He said that he hadn’t taken it. But that night she dreamed how it had happened. One day during the harvest she’d gone out to gather, an old man came in through the malt house, opened the kitchen door and went into the room. The innkeeper saw him, though, and followed behind him in stocking feet and wanted to see what he was doing. First he drank from one bottle, and then another, and then another. Finally he took some of the coins when he left, but he was caught by the innkeeper when he left. He shoved him around a bit, took the money from him and let him go. See, she’d dreamed that, and now the innkeeper had to admit it, he didn’t want to tell her about it before.
