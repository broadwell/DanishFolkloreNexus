Sören Östergård once went to the market in Nibe, and he’d bought some pots and plates and things like that. In addition, he’d gotten a load of herring, and then he came driving along with this stuff. But he’d gotten drunk, and the roads weren’t like they are now. And so he tips over. His wife was with him and his brother too. “What should we do now?” he says, “now the plates have broken.” – “Lets put the pieces of the plates in between the herring, and then we’ll tell our Ane that the herring crushed the plates.” – “Sure, we can do that,” says the brother, because he could tell that Sören had forgotten that his wife Ane was with them. They finally start driving again, but then he falls over backwards with his head in his wife’s lap, and then the brother has to take over the driving. “Hurry up so we can come home to my Ane, she always has wonderfully warm cabbage when I come home.” And there he was lying with his head in her lap.
