[There was a minister’s wife in Voldum, they called her Mr. Dorrit, she was a terrifying woman, and she hit her hired girls and starved them and was a terrible wife. She was first married to Mr. Niels, and then he died, and she married his successor, Master Laust. She had children with Niels Brun, and she and the children as well were so bad to Laust that he couldn’t stand them. One day, when he stood at the pulpit in Rude church, he said goodbye to his parishioners. He said that the Lord should take him now, because he couldn’t live here on earth because of his step-children and wife. And he died right after that and didn’t get up to the pulpit again. But he lay in his casket for fifteen years with red cheeks. Then his cheeks lost their color and people believed that he was supposed to have lived for those years, if he’d been allowed to live out his years.]
      When Dorrit was dead, she went again and was conjured down in the cellar. When the hired girls went down there, they were always afraid of touching or breaking the pole. They believed that she was there, and they were afraid that she would come up again.
