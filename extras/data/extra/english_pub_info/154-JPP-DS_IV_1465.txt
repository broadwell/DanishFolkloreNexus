In the old days in Amdal south of Amdal mill between Ugilt and TÃ¥rs there was supposed to have been a thick woods and there were also robbers there. My grandparents remembered those woods, and they went and took people up there, both those who were driving and walking, and plundered them. But no one ever really got those robbers.
