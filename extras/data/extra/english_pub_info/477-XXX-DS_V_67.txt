Once when old Jens Daniel went home from work over Tindinge hills on Tj√∏rnelunde field, a little dog came up to him and looked pathetic and looked pitifully up at him. J. D. picked it up and put it in his jacket and was going to bring it home because it looked like it was hungry and cold. But as he was looking after the dog, it seemed to get bigger and bigger, and its eyes got so red, they were like coals. Then J. D. got scared and threw the dog and at the same moment he got a smack on the head so hard that he lost his hat and never found it again. The dog disappeared at once too.
