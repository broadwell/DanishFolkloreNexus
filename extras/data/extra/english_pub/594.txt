A pregnant woman had died, and she got a bottle of water and some baby clothes in her grave with her; but when her delivery date came, she walked again and cause a terrible disturbance. But then a brave farmhand asked her why she was haunting. "I need more baby clothes. I only have enough for one child, not two." So he cut a strip off of his shirt and both of his stockings. Then there was peace.
