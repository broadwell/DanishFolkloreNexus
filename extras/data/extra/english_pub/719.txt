In a farm in Adslev a woman died and left her little children. When they later got an evil stepmother, she visited them every night to care for them. After twelve o’clock, they saw her wander about in the house and among other things lie over the crib to nurse her youngest child. They searched out the area minister to rid them of this monster, and he advised them to strew linseed about the farm and, since then, they haven’t seen any hauntings on that farm.
