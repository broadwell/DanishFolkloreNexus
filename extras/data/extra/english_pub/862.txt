A man from Ã˜rum wanted to drive to Randers one day. When he was to go home again, it had gotten a bit late, and when late at night they saw a mound far off in the distance that was on four glowing poles, the horses stampeded and they tipped over. They got on their feet again and hadn't been injured. Then they were to go past the mound, and then his wife said to him that he should go over and see what it was. No, he didn't want to, there were two bridges that they had to cross, and then it could happen that the horses stampeded again.
