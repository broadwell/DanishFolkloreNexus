There was an old man here in the area who’d convinced himself that he knew the Bible quite well, and he asked my mother once if she knew the name of Adam’s second wife. Then she swore and said she certainly did, she was called Kjesten Mosskovs. She knew a man who was called Adam and he had a second wife.
