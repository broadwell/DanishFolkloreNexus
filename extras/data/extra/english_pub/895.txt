About sixty years ago, the marsh that now belongs to Sebberkloster  (Sebber monastery) was a big morass filled with ponds and streams. Early one morning, a man walked along the road from Barmer township to Store Ajstrup which is now an annex of Sebber but used to belong to Lundby. He saw a man floating above the marsh, and as far as the man could tell, he was carrying a large load of cobbler’s work on his back. He didn’t touch the ground with his feet, and he couldn’t anyway as there wasn’t as much as a dry spot that a bird could land on there. That was the Jerusalem’s Cobbler.
