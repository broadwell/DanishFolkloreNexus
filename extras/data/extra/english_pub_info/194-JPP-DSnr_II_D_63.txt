Captain Skjærul (Schiern) at Linderum farm was also called Captain Tæerløs because he had a corn on his toes. In his time there were two men from Taars who had villeinage at Linderum farm and they held the villeinage days twice a week. When they were to go home at night, they used to take a couple of the farm’s horses and ride part of the way home on them. But this night they weren’t accompanying each other, one of them wanted to walk home and the other wanted to ride. He also got hold of a horse, it was really easy to get, but the longer he rode, the higher up he sat, and finally he was way up in the sky. Finally he got wise to the fact that the horse had a pair of large horns and he got so frightened when he saw these horns that he let himself fall down and he fell in a thicket and junk and he got knocked so hard that he was bedridden for an entire month. After that he didn’t like to ride.
