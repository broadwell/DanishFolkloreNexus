In Hvidbjærg church at Tyholm there was once a lindorm, and when it got so big that it could reach around the church, they believed that the church would be tipped over. Then it was important to get it killed. But there was nobody who dared go up against it. Then they decided to use a bull calf, and raise it on newly milked milk for three years. The people in Hvidbjærg provided the milk for that communally and at that time nobody dared go into the church. Now when the time was up, the bull had become big and strong and was to fight the monster now. Then the bull was let into the church and the people stood in a crowd outside to find out the end. Now there was an incredible row and the bull snorted so that the church shook but after a while everything grew quiet in there and some of the bravest crawled up to the windows to see if the monster had been killed. Then they saw that both the lindorm and the bull lay dead and swam in their own blood. Then they opened the church door in a rush and dragged the dead bodies out. They got the lindorm down to the fjord and into a boat and they sailed with it to a little island, and buried it there and that island has been called Lindø ever since.
