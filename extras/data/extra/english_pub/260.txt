I had an uncle who was almost blind and so he went to seek advice from the cunning woman in Vindblæs. She gave him some herbs that were to be boiled and then he was supposed to drink it. Amongst the herbs, there was a piece of paper with nine notches like a comb, but the paper was narrower at one end than at the other. He was supposed to take one notch each morning for nine mornings, and start at the narrow end. He was also supposed to go to a mill and get some shaft grease and put it on a poultice and put it on his neck. But it didn’t help at all.
