Before there weren’t any small shops where you could by provisions as there are today. When it got to be spring, for a lot of small holders, they didn’t have much food left. Then they’d walk over to those who did have some left, and they’d complain to them for quite a while. “It's never been as bad as it is this year,” they’d say, “with getting provisions, we don’t have even the worst food in our house.”
