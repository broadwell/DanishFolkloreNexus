An old shepherd said that he had a sister who was the cow herd one place and she wound up dancing with the mound dwellers on the mounds. They convinced her to come again and dance with them once she'd gotten the cows in at night. Just as soon as she'd gotten the cows in, she threw the tethers and went off. They got a farmhand up on a stallion and he went after her, and he reached her just as she got to the mound and was to go in there. He got her up and off they went. Otherwise she never would have come back from them.
