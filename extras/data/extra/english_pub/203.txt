There was also a legend that there was supposed to be a dragon in Kloon mound near Hjørring. They dug after a treasure and got ahold of a gold ring on a chest. But when they spoke, the chest sank down into the mound again, but they kept the ring, and it was placed in St. Kathrine’s church in Hjørring. The town is supposed to have gotten its name from this, since it was originally Højring.
