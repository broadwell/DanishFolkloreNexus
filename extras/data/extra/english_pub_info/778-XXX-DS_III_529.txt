Many years ago, the church bells in Kværndrup were to be repaired, since they weren’t exactly well-sounding bells. A Mr. Essi was contracted to do this and he was given some silver and brass to patch them with. In the meantime, he pocketed this good stuff and patched them with copper and lead. When they went to ring the bells, they were far too dead in their sound, and so they pulled harder and harder in the ropes and finally it was so violent that one of the bells knocked itself loose and flew out of the sound holes, all the way over the town and finally fell down into “Dybe Mæ,” a marsh west of Kvændrup which belongs to Egeskov farm. The weird thing about it was that while the bell was flying over the town, it sang the following verse: 
“Silver and brass has Mr. Essi hidden, 
Copper and lead, that’s what he put in!” 
Now three or four young men were sent out to look for the bell, and they found no less than the hole where it was  and got a rope put around it. They had already gotten it up to the surface when one of the young men swore that now they had it; but as soon as he said that, the bell went down to the bottom, and since then nobody has seen or heard from it.
