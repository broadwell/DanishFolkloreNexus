A man from Langerimt in Als parish near Hadsund told me one day that when he was a little boy, he had been sold in Hurup Inn to some travelers. His father had finished the deal and the money was to be paid. The travelers explained that they were going to put him in a barrel by the North Sea with a pretzel in his hand so that the sea wouldn’t flood the land. It wasn’t a small sum that was promised for the boy, but in the meantime Jep Jensen came by, he was the school teacher in Hurup, and there was a different turn of events. He took the boy, who was called Jakob Nielsen, along home with him, yelled at the father and the deal fell through.
