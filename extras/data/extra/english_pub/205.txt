There are two or three farms in Taars parish that they call Koldbroen, and a girl disappears from one of the farms. She was gone for five or six years and nobody knew what had happened to her. Now there was an old man on the farm, he was her father and also a pensioner, because the other daughter had gotten married and her husband had gotten the farm. So the old man was alone home one Confirmation Sunday because his daughter and her husband were at church. Then the girl who’d disappeared comes in to him around eleven or twelve with a platter of warm meat and says, “Here’s some warm meat for you, dad.” – “Where are you now, my girl?” – “I live west of here in the mound,” she says. – “What do you do there?” – “I’m married and have three children.” – “Well, stay here now,” he says, “it's probably best that you stay here with us now that you’ve come back.” No, she wanted to go home to her children, and after that they never saw her again. The girl was called Ane and Anton Koldbroen comes from that family that lived in that farm. It was Anton’s grandmother who dug in the mound fifty years later, and the spade became completely bloody. Then she got scared and let it be. In the same mound there was a large hole in the middle and there were smaller holes around the edge, and it was big enough that you could put your fist down there. The mound dwellers probably used the holes to go up.
