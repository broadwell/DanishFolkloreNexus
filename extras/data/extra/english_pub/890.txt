There was a farmer in Åsum near Odense, he had worked in his youth as a farmhand in the town, and in the same farm there was also a big boy. Then one Mortens Eve the farmhand asks the boy if he wants to earn some money. Yes, the boy wanted to. Then he’d get eight shillings if he’d go to the church and run around it three times and each time yell into the keyhole, “I want to belong to the Devil!” When he got to the door the third time, a white form with fire coming out of its mouth appeared. It was the farmhand who had put a sheet over himself and some rotted wood in his mouth. The boy didn’t yell the third time, but went crazy from the experience.
