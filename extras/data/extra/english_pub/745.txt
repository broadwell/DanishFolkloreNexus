There was a man and a farmhand who were out in the heath and digging peat besides the swamp. Then the man says to the farmhand: “Lets take a real nap today, because peat diggers are allowed that.” This man had become enemies with his neighbor. That guy had an old mare nag which stood with her foal nearby. So now after they’ve lain down to sleep, the man gets up and goes on his way, but the farmhand notices that the man has gone. He thought that he’d gone off to work, but then he sees that one hell of a big wolf is coming, and it jumps up on the foal. Then the farmhand thought: “That would be a real shame, if it’s going to go and tear the man’s foal apart.” With that he grabs his scythe and wants to go and save the foal, but as soon as he gets there, the wolf rips the throat out of the foal, and he chases the wolf away, but the foal was dead. The farmhand was really sad about this and went and looked about and the man was gone and there was nobody to see. He thought about going over to the other man to tell him that the foal was dead. But in the meantime he sees that the man he’d been digging peat with comes up from the left side of the hill, where they had lain down. “Where’ve you been?” says the farmhand. “I’ve been alone on the other side by myself.” “No you haven’t” says the farmhand, “That’s a lie, and you’re a werewolf and a devil and I’m a witness that you tore the man’s foal apart.” Just as soon as it is revealed, then they can’t become it anymore, says the legend.
