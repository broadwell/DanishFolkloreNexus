It is told that Valdemar Atterdag, under the name of Fynshoved man, made some hunting expeditions through the northern part of Fyn. He went through a farm in Egense on Hindsholm where there were two doors opposite each other, and at the time when people expected him, they left the doors open. When he came through the northernmost town, Norskov, on the trip to Fynshoved, he had gotten thirsty and he knocked on the door of a house to get something to drink. The woman opened the door and gave him a pitcher of beer (others say it was buttermilk) to drink. On his trips, Fynshoved man didn't forget to pay for what he received, and it was no different here. Since he didn't have any change, he said to the woman: "Go away with you, my horse will hit you!" The woman ran frightened inside, and at the same town there was a smack on the door. The next day the woman found a silver horseshoe embedded in the door.
