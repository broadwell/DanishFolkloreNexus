In Vester Vogdrup, their sheep had disappeared for five days. They had a shepherd boy who took care of the sheep and they said to him, go down to Støv-Karen and ask her if she can’t show us our sheep again. Sure, she could easily do that. Then she goes over to a shelf by the wood stove and she picks up a little bell and she goes out the door with it and rings it. “Now the sheep will come.” They had been standing on a little island out near Bastholm Mill and were completely surrounded by water. Then they came after she’d rung the bell. My parents knew her quite well. My mother was there when that thing with the calf happened.
