On my father’s field in Skiffard there was a big dale, Dybdal, and on each side there were big hills. To the east is Bjærgbakken (Mountain hill), and when the farmhand plowed near there one day, he found a peel board which he repaired while he ate his sandwich. When he came back, a cake lay there and he ate a little bit of it and he also gave some to the girl who was spreading manure. But she got silly stupid because of it and when she got home, she said: “Can you hear how they’re playing out in the mound? I’ve got to go out to them.” She absolutely wanted to leave and the old man now saw that she ran out to the mound. There the mound dwellers tumbled about with her the entire night. She came back well enough the next morning but they had to keep her locked up after that to keep her from going out to the mound.
