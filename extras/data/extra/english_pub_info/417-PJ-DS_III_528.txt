There were two bells in Venge church. One of them flew out and down into Venge lake. It turned out that during the casting, the master had gone and cursed it; it wouldnâ€™t do as he wanted, and it was in fact the best of the two. Now, when it was to be rung, they started it swinging on a holy day, and then as it was ringing its best, it flew out into the lake and they never got it back.
