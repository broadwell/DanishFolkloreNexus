Pers mound lies on the field that Kold-Jens owned, and there are mound dwellers inside it. It's just south of here. Kold-Jens really believed that they were there, and he prohibited both of his successors, both Rasmus and Krogsen (Krogs-Niels), the one after the other, to touch that mound, because then it would go bad for them. One evening he’d thrown a piece of rope on top of it and let it lie there until the next morning. Then it had been cut into four or five pieces. “There haven’t been any people doing that, that I know,” he said.
