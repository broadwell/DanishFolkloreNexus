A light burned out on Skjørbækshede field as well. A farmhand from Stendrup who was walking home from Skjørbækshede one night saw the light, went after it and came up to it. He knew well enough that one is supposed to put iron down at the place but he had neither knife nor flint and iron with him, but he figured out a plan. He hit one of his clogs with the other until it splintered, put the tacks into the ground and went home in stocking feet. The next day, he went out to find his treasure, and he found it sure enough, but the jackpot wasn’t too big, since it was only four shillings. A light can burn for four shillings, but not for anything less.
