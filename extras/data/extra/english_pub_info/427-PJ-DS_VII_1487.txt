There was a man who was born in the same town as me, his mother had been seduced, he was born in a victory shirt. It was made like a soldierâ€™s jacket but where the buttons were supposed to be there were some knots. People believed that he was going to be a real army leader, but he became something else, because he was a real klutz. His shirt was burned because the people that he was living with wanted to get rid of all superstition. 
     The person who has a piece of a victory shirt on him, no bullets can hit him during a battle.
