A man, who lived in a place called Mikkelsted or Mikkels farm, he wanted to drive to Dals mill one day, and so he drives through an area of sand dunes and ditches which were just north and east of the house called Sandkilde. Then he hears smithing inside a little mound or hill that the road went right past, it didn’t go the same way then as it does now. Then he calls out, “Smith me a long iron for my plow,” but keeps driving and doesn’t think anything about it. When he comes back from the mill, someone comes running out with a long iron and tells him that he should wait. He got so scared that he kept driving, but the other one threw the long iron up into his wagon. He drove home with it now and the dwarves didn’t get any payment for it. That iron could never be worn out; and there were three men, one after the other, who used it, but they never wore it out. Mikkels farm, where this happened, has been torn down now, and the fields have been placed under the control of Mølle farm and two other farms, but that was over in Lørslev township.
