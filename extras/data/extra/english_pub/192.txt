A count by the name of Feer lived at Baggesvogn and he and his wife are buried in Sindal cemetery. They had oxen on the farm and then one winter fifty of them died. They believed that it was evil people who were guilty of it. The lady borrows some wise books from the Bragholdt hag and then she got two other women with her who were to help her with this. They go into a room in the farmhouse which is called the blue room and they set something up and they read in the books and read the Devil to them. He was to tell them who the guilty one was, but it was never cleared up. One of the women who was along had a son at the farm who was the ox hand and they wanted him along but he didn’t want to. So the three were alone. A little later that night, screams were heard and then when they opened up, all of the women lay there and were torn to stumps and pieces. Just at the moment they died, three tears appeared on the comforter on the bed in which the ox hand lay. He got frightened and came up but then his mother was dead. The first one to come in and see it was my father’s maternal aunt, she worked there. They couldn’t plaster the blood spots on the wall over, but when Nyholm got there, he tore the entire wall down and then when new stones were put up, it stopped.
