It is common knowledge among the old people in the local parishes that Gjemsø in the old days was called Broby, but because of something that happened the name was changed. They say that one time a griffen, called a gam by the people, came flying and sat itself down on a tall mountain near the town, called Hellebjærg, and sat there for two days, and nobody dared leave their house or let their cattle out. After a while, they let a bull out on the road and it went and brayed, and the gam became aware of it, and swung down and grabbed him in his claws and flew up on the mountain again with him, and ate his blood and his flesh. After that, the gam flew off on his way. And since then the town is called Gamshøj and now, after normal usage, Gjemsø.
