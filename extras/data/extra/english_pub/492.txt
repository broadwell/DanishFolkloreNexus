There was also a certain manor lord at Søby Søgård who had made an agreement with the Evil One that he would indulge him for a certain amount of time, and then he would possess him both hide and hair. Now when the time drew near for the Devil to come get him, he had no idea what to do to get free. Finally, he decided to have his rooms covered with down comforters. Now, when the time had come, the Devil came and it only helped a little bit that the soft comforters could cushion the sinner, since now he was danced about the room so that soon there wasn't a stump of either the manor lord or the comforters left. The blood that spattered about on the walls can never be covered over and one can still see it now.
