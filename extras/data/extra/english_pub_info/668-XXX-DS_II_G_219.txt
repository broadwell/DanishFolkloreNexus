Once there were a pair who were engaged some place in Jutland, and a short while before their wedding day, the man dies. The girl went about mourning him quite a bit. She worked for a parish clerk who lived a little ways outside of town close to the church, and one evening she'd been in town on an errand and was walking home again when she saw someone on horseback riding towards her on the way from the cemetery. The moon was shining clearly and she could see that it was her beloved. When the rider came close to her, he sang, 
"The moon shines brightly, 
the dead one rides sickly, 
aren't you afraid?" 
The girl stood stock still out of fright and the rider sang the same thing again, but when he began to sing it a third time, she started running home. When the rider saw that, he jumped off the horse and ran after her, but she managed to slam the door before he reached her and she could hear from inside how he stood outside scraping on the door.
