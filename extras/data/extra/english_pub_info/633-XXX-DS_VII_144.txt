There was a man called Anders Allehånde who lived in Østrup. He was cunning, but he wasn't as cunning as Kristen Madsen. Then there was a grocer from Hjørring, they called him Niels Gryt, and his wife accused the cunning man of being a witch. That's enough, it goes bad, the grocer gets angry, and the district bailiff and lots of other important people are brought together, and Anders Allehånde is to be sentenced to lose his right hand and his fingers. Now when they were done with all that, and he was sentenced to this, then a large dog comes to the door with big clear eyes, and scratches at it. "If you won't let the dog in," he says, "then I will." Then he called the grocer's wife by name and when he did that, she was standing there buck naked in there with them, and the grocer took his cloak and threw it over her. Now Anders Allehånde was saved, because they could see what kind of a wife the grocer had. After that time, Anders couldn't remember anything.
