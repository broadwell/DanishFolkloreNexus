There’s supposed to have been an inn in the house that’s a little east of Il-Bro on the southern side of the Ugilt road, and one who was called Skytte-Kræn lived there. He was supposed to be a bit given to witchcraft, and there’s a legend that he’d killed someone. People found the entire skeleton of person and the heads of two out in the yard.
