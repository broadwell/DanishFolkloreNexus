There were two mounds that lay a little distance from each other, one was called Boel and the other was called Bas. My father knew where they were, and he told about them. Then there was a girl who disappeared and many years passed. One day somebody met her, he knew her, and she came running really fast. Then he said, “Good day, Boel, you sure seem to be busy, stay and talk to me a bit.” – “I don’t have time,” she says, “I’m coming from Boel and have to go to Bas to prepare a birthing bed.”
