When one wanted to catch a nisse, one would use the following procedure: One went out into the woods to cut down trees. With the sound of the falling tree, a nisse would come running as fast as they could to see how people managed that and they’d sit down next to them and would talk to them about both this and that. People at that time wanted to have a nisse in their house, and so they wanted to catch one. Then when they’d wedge the tree out, it often happened that the nisse’s little tail would get caught in the chink and then when they’d try to get the tail out, it would be caught. Then the nis was caught and in that way they caught a lot of nisse in the old days.
