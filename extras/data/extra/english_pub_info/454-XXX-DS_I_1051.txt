Once a little goblin came in to a farmer in his living room where the whole family was gathered to enjoy a pig which had been born the same day, but died shortly thereafter, and now had been put in a pan to be fried. The goblin said nothing when he came in and didn’t answer either when he was asked, and this puzzled people a great deal. Some thought that he was a little homeless boy, others a nisse, but they let him sit since it was a shame to chase him out if he were a poor boy and not too smart to offend him if he were a nisse. Now when the wife came in carrying the pig to the table, he burst out: “Widely I’ve traveled and much have I seen; but I’ve never before seen a sausage with four legs and a snout.”
