Some farmhands and girls from Vium wanted to go to a dance in Torning. They took the road over the so-called west bridge, a ford near the aforementioned town. When they got there, it was high water, so they couldn’t get over the foot bridge. They discussed how they were going to get across. While they stood there, they discovered a headless horse; one of the bravest sat up on the horse and more followed the example .... It became so long that its front part reached the opposite bank, while the back side stood dry on the other side. While they are now waiting like that, one exclaims: “Jesus Christ, now I’ve never seen so long a horse!” As soon as that was said, the horse broke in the middle and the farmhands and girls were dumped into the water.
