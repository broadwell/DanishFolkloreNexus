Late on night, a farmhand from Boslunde rode from Skjelsk√∏r. When he got to Dyrehavsbakke, he saw that it was standing on four posts, and the trolls were busy dancing. He stopped to watch the fun; but then some trolls came out and offered him a drink in a gold cup. The farmhand accepted the cup, but he tossed the drink behind him and the horse, and then he took off as fast as he could with the cup in his hand. The trolls ran after him, and they got closer and closer. He rode onto the fields and that helped; he could ride across the fields, but when the trolls came to a furrow, they had to run around it. Despite that, they were very close to the farmhand when he got to Boslunde, but then he threw the cup over a church wall, and now it was on consecrated ground, so the trolls couldn't get it, they had to turn their noses around and go home. The next day it turned out that the horse had numerous scorched spots on its rump, it was some drops of the drink that had done that. The cup was used for a long time as the chalice in Boslunde church.
