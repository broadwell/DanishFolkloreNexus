In Søndergård in Nielstrup, where my grandfather was born, the controllers came and unharnessed their horses. Out in their scullery they were distilling as much moonshine as they could. But the farm wife went out and greeted the visitors and asked them in and gave them coffee and bread, and she knew how to talk them up and to wrangle her way out of the situation so they didn’t search the house at all. Then they went around to the other farms and they confiscated the distilling equipment over at Per Snog’s farm, and then they came back with it.
