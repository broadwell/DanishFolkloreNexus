Hr. Speitzer at Örndrup was not well liked by the peasants because of his harshness. That led to him being attacked by two farmhands out on the heath once when he was on his way home from Løgstør, they crushed his right hand between two stones, and then they fled. He sold the farm in 1777 and supposedly met one of the farmhands on the street in Copenhagen later. He got away though and apparently came to Rendsborg where he became an innkeeper. He was called Kristen Roed and was the brother of the current farm owner in Sjørup, Kristen Roed's paternal grandfather.
