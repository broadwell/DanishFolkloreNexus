There was a pious god-fearing monk who lived in Snæverris woods near Birkendegård who had adopted a little girl and given her a lamb as a playmate, and they were always together. Then it happened that three men, who suffered from a really bad disease, came to the monk to be cured. "Yes, I can cure you, but it will cost you a sacrifice of someone who has yet learned how to sacrifice," said the monk, "so can’t I avoid doing this?" No, he couldn’t. "So dig a grave!" And the three men started. Then he called to the little girl and said to her, "Can you get your lamb to jump down in that grave?" — "Well, that’s easy," she said gladly and called for the lamb, which immediately jumped down. "Toss earth on it now!" the monk said to the men, and so it was buried, but the men were cured instantly.
