The werewolf tore sheep and calves to death and attacked the cows so that blood would run from their udders. Once a lamb disappeared everyday from the town’s herd one place, and people thought that it was a wolf or a fox that was doing it. But the woman didn’t really believe the man and hung her old red shirt over the lamb. She took care that they all came in, but one disappeared nevertheless, and when the man came in for dinner, she saw threads from her red shirt stuck in between his teeth. There’s a saying about people whose eyebrows have grown together over their nose: “He could become a werewolf.”
