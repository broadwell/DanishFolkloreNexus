There was once a poor farmer from Suldrup who drove to Ålborg. When he got to Dra(g)strup Sige not too far from Ålborg, his jades were tired. He unharnessed them and let them graze in the woods which at that time reached almost all the way to Ålborg. Then he heard somebody who called out but he didn’t dare answer because he was scared that he’d be noticed grazing his animals on someone else’s property. Then they called out a second time but he still didn’t answer. The other one called out to make sure that nobody was nearby because he thought that if somebody heard him they’d answer. Then the poor farmer heard a jingling as if someone had poured a huge amount of money down into a hollow tree but he couldn’t see anything. He got down on his knees now and prayed to God that if he’d show him the tree where the money was hidden then he’d build a temple to honor God. He found the tree too and got ahold of the money. When he got home he began leveling the place where the church now stands. Then there was a rich man in the town who saw this and said, “What are you doing here? Why are you leveling this place?.”--The poor man answers, “I think I’ll build a church, it’s so far for us to go to God’s house.” -- “Well,” says the rich man, “if you’ll build the church, then I’ll put up the tower, the altar and the choir box.” They agreed to that and the poor man built the church. But the rich man wasn’t able to add more than the altar and the choir box; the tower never came to be and that’s how the church stands to this very day.
