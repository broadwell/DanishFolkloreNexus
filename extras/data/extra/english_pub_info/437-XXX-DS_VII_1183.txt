Sometimes it happens at farms that a newborn lamb that is put in a manger alone dies before it can be put into a stall. The best defense against that is to get someone to give you a lamb. But this kind of misfortune can also be due to certain things, and the situation can be improved by getting rid of these things. That's how a man once went and sought help from a cunning woman and he told her that his calves died if they stood in such and such a stall, and he asked her for advice. Yes, there were reasons for that, he should go ahead and clean the calf stall, they would likely find a carved runner stone, they should take that away, because as long as it was there, no calf would be able to live in the stall, but he must not stop until he found the stone, because it was quite certain it was there. The man went home with this message and immediately began cleaning the calf stall, but he dug and dug and didn't find a stone. Finally, after a long while, when he had gotten down four feet, he sure enough found a long thin carved stone. That was now taken away and after that not a single calf died in the stall.
