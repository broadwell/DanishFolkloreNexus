There was a girl who had a stepmother and she was really mean to her. So she often went for walks out in the woods, because she couldn’t stand to be at home, and out there there’s a cat who comes to her every day. It was a young man who had been changed into a tom cat by a witch, and he also walked out there in the woods. Then he says to the girl one day that she could get up on his back and come home with him. She did that and now he ran off with her. When they had gone a good long way, the cat asked her if she could see anything. Yes, she could see a big castle. “That’s where we’re going,” he says, “because my parents live there.”
