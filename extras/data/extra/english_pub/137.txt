A minister was catechizing with the youngsters on the church floor. Then a girl was to read the first commandment, and the minister asks, if she didn’t have any false gods. “No,” she says, “I’m a little bit like ours and not at all like the foreigners.” Then she was to read the second commandment. “Do you take God’s name in vain?” No, she didn’t do that either, because she never mentioned him. Then she reads the third commandment. “Do you honor the Sabbath as a rest day?” “Yeah, I don’t want to do much on the regular days and nothing on the holy days.” Then she recited the fourth commandment. “Do you honor your father and mother?” “No, they weren’t worth honoring, since the one was hung and the other was burned.” Then she read the fifth commandment. “Haven’t you ever killed anyone?” “No, and I won’t either, and that’s why they’re crawling around on my back like sheep ticks.” Then it was the sixth commandment, had she sinned against that. “No, those who see me during the day don’t want to have anything to do with me at night.” Then she read the seventh commandment. Hadn’t she stolen anything? “No, I don’t like to go places during the day, and certainly not at night, and so I can’t steal.” Then came the eighth commandment. Hadn’t she ever borne false witness. No, she’d avoided that, she never went places where you had to witness, because no one considered what she said worth much. Next she read the ninth commandment. Hadn’t she ever coveted her neighbor’s house? No, she wasn’t that envious, as long as she could get some shelter to crawl in at night and if she couldn’t, then she did what the other beggars did and asked for lodgings. Finally, the tenth commandment came. She didn’t want to covet that either, as long as she had enough to eat for one sitting, she didn’t want any more until she got hungry again.
