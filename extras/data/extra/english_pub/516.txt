A woman in Understed could do witchcraft and she usually turned her son into a fox and sent him over to another parish to steal geese. A man in a farm over there had heard tell of this and when he sees a suspicious fox come creeping about he says to it, “So, is it you, little Jens?” Then the fox became a boy with a red scarf on his head, and it was the witch’s son. A man walked by the witch’s house and she was standing in the doorway with a peg and made motions in the air like she was milking. Milk came in streams through the air, so it was foaming all over the peg. As soon as she saw the man, she ran inside and slammed the door behind her. The same woman had a little boy who said to the other boys: “Well, mom can milk Nørgård’s cows with two pegs, but it can also happen that she gets nothing other than shit.”
