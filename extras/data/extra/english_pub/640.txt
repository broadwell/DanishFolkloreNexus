When Paul Væver was a boy, he and a girl went together to a house out on Dalby field. When they got to the woods near Skelenborg, they saw a big white person. Poul Væver’s father drove along the same place along with another farmer, and the white person showed himself for them too. But they had a neighing horse pulling their wagon, so they couldn’t be thrown into the ditch. When the white person came to town, one person said, “Look, there comes that sprightly Satan!,” but the other person said that he should shut up.
