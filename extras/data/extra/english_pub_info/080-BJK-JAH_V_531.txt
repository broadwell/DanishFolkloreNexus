There was one, they called her Sidsel Hæls, because she tied one of her legs up so that her heel was up by her ass, and then she made herself a pair of crutches and went around begging. But she couldn’t do this in the areas where they knew her, and she once went all the way over to Store-Restrup to beg. The foreman asked her where she was from, and after a while she admitted that she was from Årestrup. Then the foreman wrote to the district judge Kalmar and teased him a bit, that he allowed people like that go around begging. There weren’t any cripples like that on his manor. At first, they wouldn’t accept that she was one of theirs, but finally it became clear that this had to be Sidsel, and then she wound up being put on the wooden horse. She’d been incarcerated in Restrup for so long that she’d almost died and then to have this on top of it, that was a nice welcome for a woman like that.
    Immediately after that, Kalmar got sick and died. When they got to the church door with the body, Sidsel Hæls came and said both loud and clear, so that everyone could hear it, that she wished that he’d wake up in Hell.
