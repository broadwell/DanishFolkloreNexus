Minister Patberg from Jebjærg, who is well known in Salling for his ability to conjure, had to go one night and conjure a ghost. The minister drove and when he got close to the place where the ghost went, he says to his driver that he should wait there with the wagon and not be bothered by anything he saw or heard. A little after the minister left, the driver hears an incredible noise, and since it continues for a long time, he thinks that the minister is probably having difficulties, so he takes the wagon whip in hand and rushes off to help the minister. But when the farmhand gets almost up to the minister, he [the minister] yells at him to stay away, because otherwise he can’t get power over the ghost. Finally the minister is finished and he comes over to the farmhand; he then says to him: “If you ever drive on this road where we’re stopped in the future, it will cost you your life.” The farmhand remembered the warning for a while but then one night when he is coming from market in Skive, he thinks that it’s quite a ways to avoid the forbidden road, he drives in on it but then tips over and breaks his neck.
