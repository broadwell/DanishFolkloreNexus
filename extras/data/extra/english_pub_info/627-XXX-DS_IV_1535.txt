A man, who lived south of Nibe, he told about how his parents had a field which went all the way up to Nibe field, and he had worked there as a shepherd out on the heath and had seen that there were seven graves in which seven robbers were buried. Those robbers had gone into a farmer one Christmas eve, and he quickly realized what kind of people they were, since they each had a rifle. So then they sat down at the table, and it was set for them, and they got both food and drink. But in the meantime the farmer sent his wife out the back way and she went over to a manor farm, which is called Lundbæk. There were soldiers stationed there at that time, but there were only six, and those six didn’t dare take on such a task. So they sent a messenger over to Øland, they also had six. It happened rather luckily that the fjord was frozen so they could get across it on the ice. While his wife was away, the man went and poured well for his guests. They had put down their flintlock rifles, and so he filled the glasses all the way up so that they spilled over and with that opportunity he spilled some on the rifles. When they came from Øland, they were eleven all together and they stood outside and yelled hurray. Then the robbers grabbed their rifles and wanted to shoot but they couldn’t because the man had spilled moonshine on the gunpowder. All seven of them were caught and then they were executed and buried out on the heath.
