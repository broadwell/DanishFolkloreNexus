Kristoffer Jennöww had a friend who was called Pjalt Johan, and he lived somewhere between Nielstrup and Hallendrup. His wife was called Kat-Ma-Elgårds. He went about and collected brass and copper and cats and cat skins. They killed the cats themselves. There was a man who lived next to him, and he came and borrowed a mark from him every Monday morning, before he went out and shopped, and he brought it back again every Sunday morning. He believed that that mark was lucky. It was my father he borrowed the mark from, so I know that its true.
