At Svejstrup-Østergaard, the nisse had built his house under their barn and they lost a head of cattle in a certain stall. One day during the harvest, while the farm wife walked home alone, the nisse comes up to her and asks her quite politely to come and help his wife give birth, she was having a difficult birth. He showed her a little hole which he slipped down and she was able to crawl through it and then she saw that their bed was right under this stall. She helps his wife give birth, and it was successful. Then the husband comes and says, “Well, you should have a little something for the inconvenience.” Then he swept the dirt off the floor and put it in her apron, and when she gets up again on land, she threw these sweepings away. As soon as it fell, she could see that it glittered like gold, but it disappeared immediately. Then that night as she lay in her bed, she thought that the nisse came and said, “Well, you refused my gifts yesterday, even though they were better than they looked, but as soon as you get up you should go and look by the mouth of the spotted ox and you’ll find something there that won’t disappear as easily. I want you to have one part of it and the other part I’d like you to give to the church for my child. When she goes out there in the morning, there were two silver pots by the spotted ox’s mouth, and they got one and the church in Dover got an altar pitcher. It's true. He also told her the damage the animal was doing. He showed her a damp spot on the ceiling and it dripped down into their bed. After that, they never put any animals in that stall.
