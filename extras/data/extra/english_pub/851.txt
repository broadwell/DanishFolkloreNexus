Minister Ole Schytte from Vallekilde had an accord with the Devil and because of that he went again and haunted in the parsonage in the shape of a white calf. When the calf appeared one night at the farm, the current minister, dean Bech, sent his serving girl up to the church to get three books and then he said to his farm hand Jørgen that he should take the calf by the ear and drag it out into the meadow in the parsonage’s field and then he was supposed to come back. When the minister got outside of the gate, he met the girl with the books which he took under his arm and went down to the meadow and said to Jørgen, who stood there with the calf: “Now you can go home, and with God’s help I’ll be back in the parsonage just as soon as you.” When Jørgen had made it a ways down the road, he stood still and listened, and he heard that the minister said: “Now you have knocked two books away from me, and if you can knock the third away from me, then you’re more than a match for me.” Jørgen got scared now and hurried along, but soon afterward he heard a loud strange noise, and a moment later the minister caught up with him so they came back to the farm together. Jørgen saw then that he had a book under his arm and it was the Bible. Since then, there has never been haunting in the parsonage. The place is now called Mariemose, and Jørgen’s widow still lives in the parish.
