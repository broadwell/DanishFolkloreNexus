A man rode out on the heath one night outside of Kjærbølling along with his horses to put them out to graze. When he was on his way home, he saw someone walking in front of him and he thought it was a neighbor so he called out to him; but the other one continued to walk and the man said then: “Can’t you wait, damn you (literally: for the Devil!)” Now the other man waited; but when the other man got there, he discovered that it was the Devil, who he now had to accompany. The next night he was supposed to go out to him again, but his wife and children wouldn’t let him go. Then there was such a row that they thought that the barn had tipped over, so the man had to go out. The next day, he went over to minister Bang in Vilstrup in Skibet parish and asked him to help him get rid of the Evil One’s company. Then the minister taught him a verse that he was to read for the Evil One the next time he went out to him. In addition, he told him to carry a plowshare in his hand and when the Devil asked him to give him his hand, he should give him the plowshare instead. The man did this too when he went out to him the next night, and the Devil grabbed it so hard that he kept a piece of the plowshare in his hand. Ever since then he didn’t have to go out to the Evil One at night, but he got sick and wasn’t fit for anything ever again.
