Rold minister didn’t know how the time went, and didn't remember when he was to be in the church. Then he figured out a system. He'd make himself a birch bundle each day while he went out there and worked on the farm, and when he had seven, then he knew that it was Sunday. The parish clerk discovers what was going on, and so he goes and steals one of the bundles from him. Since the minister counts his bundles every morning, he thinks that it is Saturday and it is actually Sunday. When he now gets down to the alder meadow with the cattle and begins to cut away at the birch trees, the parish clerk begins ringing. He gets surprised and has to drop everything and runs home. He hurries into his vestments and gets his book under his arm. But he needed a little to eat before he goes up to the church, and since the girl was cooking cabbage, she has to ladle some out for him, he could stand there and swallow a bit. The dish was standing beside the cabbage pot and while he was slurping it up, his book fell into the pot. He fished it out again and then he put it on a three-legged stool. At that moment a hungry dog came and snapped it up, since it was soaked through with fat. When he got to the church, he said that they should submit and be thankful, since God’s true words were in a dog’s behind.
