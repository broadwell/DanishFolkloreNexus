There was an old town herdsman in the town Aså who got his pay as long as he lived. There where he'd stayed, that's where he visited after he died, and he stood and scraped at a post in the barn. A lazy lad got work there. Then the others told him that he shouldn't go out at such and such a time because then the herdsman came. "Well, I really want to talk to him," said this here lad. He goes out and the herdsman was there. "What are you doing here?" the lad said quite freely to him. "I'm looking for a twenty-four shilling piece." Then he went off and sat down on a rock way out in the heath. The boy followed behind him. "What are you sitting here for?" -- "Here is where my pay is." The boy went home now, and the next day he went out to the post in the barn. There was a split in it, and a twenty-four shilling piece tumbled out of that. "Well, then there must also be something to look for out by that stone," he thought. He had made a note of where the stone was, and then he went out to it one day and wanted to look around. He digs a bit underneath it and finds a sock and inside it was a whole lot of silver coins, several ten shilling pieces, that were used and considered as marks and stamped as twelve shilling pieces, and rigsorter (royal pieces) and two mark pieces and six shilling pieces, and some small change, but there were a lot. He took the sock with him and hid the money, and when he was free he bought himself a farm and became a rich man from the Aså herdsman's money. And since then they didn't see the revenant.
