I knew a woman who was probably from the Århus area. She said that there was a witch in her home. A young girl asked her as a joke to teach her how to do witchcraft. She took her up to the attic. In one of the posts there was a round hole, and the witch had a staff which fit into it. She told the girl that she should put the staff in the hole and go the wrong way around with it and say: “Now I run around the pole, my God, my Lord I will abandon.” But the girl said instead: “Now I run around the pole, my God, my Lord will me protect!” Then the witch became furious and the girl did not become a witch.
