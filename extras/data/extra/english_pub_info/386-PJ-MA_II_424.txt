There was an old rope maker in Svejstrup, he was a German and a bit odd in his speech. He called himself a flax beater, and once he told the following: When I got married I had seven cloth shirts, now I don’t have, God be dead, enough to wipe my ass with. One time I’d gone to Hem for intestines and when I got home I put the bucket with the intestines in it in the anteroom. After I’d sat there for a little while I hear something banging about in the bucket. I say to my son Kristian: “Go and see what’s in the bucket.” He went out but he couldn’t see anything. A little later, it started again. Then I said to my son Niels: “Go out and see what’s in the bucket.” Niels went out and couldn’t see anything either. Then I said to my little Lars. “Lars, let me see if you’re a good boy, and see what’s in the bucket.” Lars went out, and couldn’t see anything either. Then I got up and took a lantern in one hand and a staff in the other. When I got out there, there was, God be dead, a weasel eating the intestines. Then I smacked it one across the back so it jumped right over the peat pile. But boy did that devil take off.
