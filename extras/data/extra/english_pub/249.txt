A vagabond came to my great grandfather’s mother’s house in Nielstrup and he asked for something. So she wanted to give him a piece of bread. But he answered and said, “Bread! If I took all the bread that I was offered, I could build a bridge between Nielstrup and Voldum.” – “Well, then you don’t need to beg, my lamb,” she says and then he got a taste of the mangle roller and then he went away.
