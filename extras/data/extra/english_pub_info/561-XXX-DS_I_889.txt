A mound man lived in a mound on Dejret field in Tved parish. A farm lay close to the mound there. One time the wife lay in her birthing bed; then the mound man came and dragged her into the mound. The dispirited man was advised to plow close to the mound. One night in wonderful moonlight the man went out to the mound and he saw that the mound dwellers were holding a dance outside of the mound. The mound man danced with the wife from the farm and she had let her hair down. As soon as she noticed her husband, she ran to him and they took off towards the farm. The mound dwellers, who ran after them, couldnâ€™t catch them. They had a hard time getting over the plowed ground, they tripped about trying to get over the furrows. The man kept his wife but she was never quite right in her head since then.
