There's a cliff on the other side of Firebakke called Halds bakke (Hald's mound). One evening, some of the sheep at Klitg√•rd had disappeared, and the farm wife wanted to get up early the next morning to look for them. As she's walking along, she meets an old woman who is walking carrying a bucket on her head. She says good morning. The woman didn't answer. "Where are you from?" She was from Halds Bakke and was going down to Rygs Bakke (Ryg's mound) to bake with her sister. It was an old woman who told that story, and it had happened to her mother, so that happened a hundred years ago. The mound dwellers in that mound sometimes put their linen out.
