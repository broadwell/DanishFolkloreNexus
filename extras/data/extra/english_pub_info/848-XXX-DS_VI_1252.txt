There were so many rats and other trash at Gj√∏l. Then a Finlap came to the island, and they're cunning, that kind of person. He promised to drive both rats and mice from the land, if they promised that there were no serpents (lindorm) in the mountain. They promised that, and so he made a bonfire and called all of the varmints to him and read for them, and they came just as quickly and went into the fire. Then it took a while, but then the lindorm came tumbling out of a hole and took the Norwegian and they both tumbled into the fire because he didn't have any power over that.
