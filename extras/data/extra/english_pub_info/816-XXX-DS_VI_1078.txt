Klemmen in Sorte-Mose could show again. My grandparents had some money stolen from them, and so granddad went over to him. He asked him what time the money had disappeared and he told him. Well, he might be able to show the money again, but if any of it had been given away or spent, then the money would not be able to be recovered. Three or four days later, on a Friday night, they were supposed to look around the foundation stones under their dining room window. They found the money too, except for a few marks and shillings. 
     One day, Klemmen sat in the living room and said, "I can feel that there's someone out in the forest who is planning to steal some wood, I better go out there and check." And he met the thief too, he was still standing there with the wood. "Well, I'll release you now but if you do it again, bad things will happen to you."
