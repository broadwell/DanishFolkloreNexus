There was a minister who was to conjure a man, and on the way home, the horses stood still, so he couldn't drive away from the spot. Then he took one of the back wheels. . . As soon as the horses were inside, he was not to open the door, but was to go to bed. He couldn't control himself, but looked out, and then the roof of the house picked up right there, and the wagon tipped over.
