It was one Midsummer’s Eve, there was a farmhand who had been off playing at a holiday party and as he was walking home, he comes past a big flock down in the meadow who were taking communion down there and they drank from an old horse bone. He began to play for them and a woman came over to him and said: “You’ll be ashamed of this tomorrow.” Then he recognized that she was his neighbor, and when he got up the next morning and went out into the barn, one of his best horses was lying there dead. He went over to her then and when she realized that he had recognized her, she paid for the horse and asked him not to talk to other people about it.
