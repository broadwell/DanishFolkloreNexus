One day the fourth Friday after Easter, a man and his wife from Enerisgård were going to church and there was an old woman at home to take care of the house while they were gone. She saw a lot of blood spots on both an old recliner, which was in the wood-burning stove nook, and in their front room and outside of the door. When they got home, she asked about it. They pretended that they had been slaughtering a chicken and it had flown around in there, and it was the blood from that that she had seen. But it was actually a peddler who had been killed. The man who was supposed to have done it was called Laust and his father Hans Eneris was also involved. Laust was never healthy after that and went around and was so wretched. When Hans Eneris was to be buried, another son who was called Anders Rognsbjærg and lived in Brejning came home for the funeral and Laust was supposed to drive. When they wanted to get through the farm portal with the corpse, the horses stood totally still. “Let me drive,” said Anders and took the reins. Then the horses reared up and jumped and then they could drive. After that, there has always been haunting at that farm. But that portal that they drove through has also been walled up and now the old house has been torn down.
