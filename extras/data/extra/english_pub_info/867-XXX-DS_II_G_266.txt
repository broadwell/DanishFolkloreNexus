A person who was mute came into a grocer's house who was lying on his deathbed, it was just at the moment that the spirit was going to leave him. Then the mute begins to howl and complain and make noises and shout. A little later, he comes into a market town, and at the same moment a soldier comes riding by quickly. Then his horse trips and he broke his neck. When the mute saw that, he claps his hands and is so happy and pleased that it is alarming. When people saw how he was enjoying himself, they wanted to know why. Then a prayer was said at the pulpit asking the Lord to open the mute's mouth so he could talk. The prayer was answered and then he said, "When I got to the grocer, the Devil was sitting at the head of his bed and took his soul, because he had cheated people in all sorts of ways with his weights and measures. But the soldier, when he fell from his horse and slammed into the ground, he gave a deep sigh to our Lord, and then an angel came from heaven and took his soul and went off to heaven with it."
