There was one who lived at old Hæstrup mill, he was bad about going again (haunting). Then Master Niels from Hjørring was out there to conjure him, but he couldn’t get control of him unless he raced him. The revenant was to go under the ground and the minister drive over the ground. The minister was allowed to choose where they were going to go, and he chose a stretch which was filled with oak trunks and roots and brushwood. They could hear the revenant underneath the ground whole time, he screamed and complained without stop. But when the minister got to the scene of the crime both of his horses fell. He came first by a few feet and then the revenant had lost, and he had to stay down there and be conjured down. That was north of Brønderup somewhere.
