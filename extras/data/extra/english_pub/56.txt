A man came walking from Ersted to Årestrup. Then two elf women came running quickly towards him, and they came in on the south side of the town while they said to each other, “He won’t catch us yet, because he isn’t clean.” Well, the man continued to go on his way along the road, but then someone came riding up to him and it was no one other than Jon’s hunter. He says, “Did any one come the other way?”--“Yes, these two little ones came by running as fast as they could.” -- “What did they say to each other?” asked the one who was riding. “They said: he won’t catch us yet, because he isn’t clean.” Then he pissed in his hand and wiped himself with it, and then he said to the man, “If you’ll lie down and stick your fingers in your ears, I’ll pay you well when I come back in a little bit.” Sure, he did that too, but then he thought that it was taking a while, and then he wanted to take his fingers out of his ears a little bit. First he took one finger out, and then he heard that somebody shot; but that wasn’t too far away, he thought it might be over by Hobro. Well, he lies down again for a little while. But then he got bored again lying there like that, and he gets up and takes the other finger out. Then he hears a shot again, but that was as far away as Horsens. Well, then he quickly puts his fingers back in his ears and he lies down in his old place. Then the rider comes with both of them, and they were tied together by their hair and they’d been hung over the horse each on their own side. Then he says, “You’ll be paid well for this, but it could have been better; you took your fingers out of your ears, and that hindered me so much that I had to ride from Hobro to Horsens to catch the last one.” Now his horse had lost a shoe along the way, and he could go and get it, then he’d have received ample payment. When the man got out there and found it, it turned out to be a gold horseshoe.
