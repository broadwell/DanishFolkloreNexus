There were a lot of ghosts and hauntings in Torslev church. Then there was a cobbler, he agreed with them that he would sit there for a whole night and get a cow in exchange. The minister drew a circle around him there in the church, and he sat there with all his cobbling equipment and cobbled and sewed on a pair of shoes and of course he also had a candle with him. Then the Devil comes and says: “You’re probably sitting here earning a cow.” No, he was sewing a pair of shoes. The Devil offered him money and put them down outside of the circle and put down one thing after another that could tempt him, but he still couldn’t get him out of the circle. The minister had told him that if he went outside of the circle he’d be torn apart. The Devil continued to tempt him for while but didn’t succeed and the cobbler earned that cow sure enough.
