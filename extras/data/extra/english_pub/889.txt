The witches are supposed to gather on St. Hans Eve at Breum Spring east of the Grinderslev monastery church by the road which goes over to Langesgård. That was before they’d go off to Troms church. There they were supposed to dance and there was one who sat and played on an old horse’s head. When they had good cats, they could also ride on them over there. Because of that, everybody in the neighborhood always marked their cats in their ears, because when they were marked, then the witches couldn’t take them.
