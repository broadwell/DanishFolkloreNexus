My old grandfather told me when I was a child that the parish people came one Sunday to Toksværd church on Sjælland, then there was a frightening monster, which was called a lindorm, lying outside the door. Nobody dared get near it, so that day they had to go home with great sorrow without being able to go to church. Only one of the men went up in the tower and took a hard shot at the monster, but everything bounced off its thick skin. They got a bull calf brought over to the parsonage and the parish people brought milk and blood for it to drink. In a few months it grew so strong that it became completely uncontrollable and finally smashed the stall door, then it jumped the cemetery wall and tore the monster to death. During the time that the calf was growing, they went to church by making a door in the north side and the other one was walled up. Now the entrance is on the west end.
