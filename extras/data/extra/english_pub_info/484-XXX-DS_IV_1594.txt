In the old days, there was a big thicket out on Linderumgård's field, in Ugilt parish, where a robber stayed, he called himself Stærke-Olger (Strong Olger) or Stærke-Ole (Strong Ole). He robbed and plundered whenever he got the chance, but he was especially known for targeting pregnant women. That's why the men one time armed themselves, surrounded the entire forest and caught him, When they'd gotten the better of him and tied him up, he shouted: "It's a good thing you caught me, because after this, rope wouldn't be able to bind me or hold me, because I've already eaten the hearts of six unborn children, and I was only missing the seventh before I'd have become invincible."
