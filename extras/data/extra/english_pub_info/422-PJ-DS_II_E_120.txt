A man had someone to plow for him. They were digging peat in Gjern heath, and there were a huge number of snakes. Then a really big one comes out. The one who was driving, he says to the other one: “Watch this!” and then he drew a line shaped like a pretzel around the snake with his staff. He might have said something too, but it's enough to know that the snake began to slither as fast as it could around on this pretzel line. Then the man went home for lunch and says to the other one: “Now don't kill it, because it's supposed to keep running until it runs itself to death.” Now this man went and plowed and he looked over to the snake because it was in his thoughts. He thought that it was a shame that it should have to run like that and so he decided to go over and take his whip and kill the snake. As soon as he'd done that, the other man is standing there and says: “You killed it, even though I asked you not to. See, if you knew what you were doing there, then you wouldn't have done it.” It was Anton's own father who was plowing and he assured me that it was true, but he didn't know what the snake was to be used for.
