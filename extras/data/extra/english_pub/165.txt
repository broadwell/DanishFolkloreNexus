There was a manor lord here at Boller in Tårs, he was quite a scoundrel, and plagued his peasants with forced labor, taxes and tithes, and then he chased them from their farms and abused them. He went again so much there at the farm that the new man who’d come there couldn’t stay. Then he got a wise minister to come and conjure him. He came at a fixed time and they also wound up speaking to each other. He chased him from the farm and past Boller water mill. He wanted to put him down in the millpond dam outside of the mill. The miller’s farmhand thought that it would be fun to watch how things went and he sticks his head out and watches. But then the revenant becomes too strong, and the minister was about to be put down in the millpond dam. Then the farmhand gets scared and pulls his head back inside. The minister then gets mastery over the man and he’s put down.
