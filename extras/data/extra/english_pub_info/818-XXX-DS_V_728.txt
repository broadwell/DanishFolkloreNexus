There was a minister in Spentrup who was good at conjuring. One night he had driven out to a house where he was supposed to conjure a ghost. He drove as fast as he could until the wagon got so heavy that the horses could no longer pull it, he got off when the minister told him to and put the one wheel in the wagon. Now they went along just fine until they got close to  home, but then the farmhand went and put the wheel on again. It was too soon, because when they got into the parsonage, the minister noticed that things were wrong, and he told the farmhand that he should hurry and get the horses into their stalls and not come out before he called for him. But the farmhand was curious and then there was some really bad trash that tipped the barn over when it left, but it didn't get any power over the minister.
