A minister had the habit of going up to the church every night and holding services, but his wife was really against this, so she convinced their farmhand to frighten the minister from going up there. “If you are a human, then speak, if you are a devil, then flee!” The farmhand got so scared by this that he ran away, but the minister’s wife convinced him to try it again. The next night when the minister went to the church again, the farmhand showed up in an ox skin and stood upright in the door of the church, but when the minister came out and saw him he began to conjure him down at the place instead of being frightened by him. Now when the farmhand had almost been conjured completely down, he said “Father, Dather, its me.” The minister, who now recognized him, became quite saddened by this, but he couldn’t conjure him back again, but he prayed for his soul at which point he sank completely down. The minister was now allowed to go unhindered to the church and hold his services at night.
