Judge Fisher from Vestervig drove one day on the highway and met an old Norwegian there, who went around begging. He stopped and asked him to get up in the wagon, because now he was under arrest for vagrancy. “Oh, no”, says the Norwegian, “let me go, because your honor’s horses cannot pull me.” “Well, well I don’t think there’ll be any problem with that, just sit up in the wagon.” After making a few objections he sits up in the wagon next to the driver. But however much he now whipped the horses, they couldn’t budge from the spot, and then the judge had to ask him to get down off the wagon again.
