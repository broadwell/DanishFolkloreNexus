A ship stranded along the North Sea coast. It came sailing quietly along and people noticed that there was something not quite right with it. So the people from the area (Vestboer) went off down to it and wanted to catch something; they managed to do that too since there was a big cargo aboard the ship, but the entire crew was dead. They began to grab and take what there was, but they they should have realized that there was something wrong, since the entire crew was dead, and it wasn’t too long before they all got sick and the disease drifted in over the entire country. See, that’s how the black plague came.
