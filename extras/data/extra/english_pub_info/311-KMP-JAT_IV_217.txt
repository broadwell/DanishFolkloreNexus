When a woman was churched, all of the women in the party would gather and their husbands would drive with them to the church. The woman who was being churched sat just like everybody else in the back of the narrow wagon in a corner chair (b√∏vlstol) with a wicker basket as a back support. It was set up in the wagon and then bound tight.
