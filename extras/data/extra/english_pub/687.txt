That time when the plague was here, wherever there were people, they rang the church bells. But they stopped after a while in many places. There was an old woman in Hjernsvig and her daughter, they lived in a little house, and they survived the plague. But then down in Tylkand there was also a young man who survived and nobody knew anything about him. And so he wanted to go out and find other people, but he didn’t think that it would be worth it to go north, since he knew that the plague came from the north. So he thought that he’d better search to the east or to the south. So he set out, but it took many days and he didn’t meet any people. Finally one day he noticed that there was smoke coming from a little house. So he went there and it was there that this widow and her daughter lived. They had stayed inside since they didn’t dare go outside as long as the plague lasted. He comes to them and settles down with them and the two young ones get married. All of the Hejnsvig dwellers descend from these two.
