If one went to an intersection at twelve o’clock three Thursday nights in a row and dug a peat stack there, one was supposed to find a toad and one was supposed to take it and keep it until the meat fell off of it. If one then took its bones and blew through them in through the church door keyhole at midnight, then someone would come and say, “What does my master command?” Then one was supposed to say what you thought you wanted and then you’d get it.
