Out on Lundbjærg field there are three mounds. One night many years ago two men from Copenhagen came to the house of a forest ranger and said to the old forest ranger and his people: “Can you show us that mound which lies east of Værum Øled, since it is supposed to have more riches than the king’s treasure room." They had namely read about this in some old books over in Copenhagen. Then the old people thought: “My lord, we could get something out of this." They served the traveling gentlemen well, and showed them one of the other two mounds the next day, and not the right one. The strangers dug in the mound for many days, but didn’t find a thing and went back to Copenhagen again. When they were definitely gone, the old forest ranger dug in the right mound where the treasure was, and they found a bunch of gold and silver as well as a rusted knight’s sword. They carried all of it home to their little house, and were delighted with their wealth. But when night came, there was such a rummaging and disturbance, that they couldn’t stay in the cottage, and they had to stay up the whole night. The next day, there was nothing wrong, but as soon as it got dark, the same rummaging began. It lasted like that for three nights, then the man went off and asked the advice of a cunning man. He said that they should take the sword and carry it back up there and bury it, that would probably help. So they did that and it helped as soon as they got rid of the sword, and now they had become rich.
