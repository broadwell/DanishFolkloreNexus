Up in Stenum there was a girl who had gotten engaged but then her boyfriend dumped her and she went around for six, eight days and thought about killing herself. Then one night it was so terribly dark and she wanted to go into the wagon house and hang herself there. But how shall I see to find a piece of rope, she thought to herself, it was so dark, since she had closed the door when she had gone in. At the same time, it gets so light in there like it was daylight and she gets so scared that she begins to read her Our Father. But as soon as she had read it, it got just as dark as it had been before. Then she went out again and the Devil didn't have any luck that time. The next day she told it to her farm girl, what had happened to her the night before, that girl worked at the next farm over, and it was in fact her who married Gotfred, the one who wound up living in the mountains. She told it to others and then things got patched up between her and her boyfriend and later they got married.
