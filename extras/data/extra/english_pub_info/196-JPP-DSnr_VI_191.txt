The miller in Aastrup mill south and west of Hjørring gets sick and is lying at death’s door. He had eight hundred rixdollars in pure silver and he wanted them with him in the grave, and so he requested that they should be placed in the coffin with him and this was done too. Now the minister comes down to the burial and he found out about this with the money. But now he won’t cast dirt on him unless they took the money out of the coffin. They’re also taken out and he’s buried. But then that night, the miller had been buried during the day, a big black dog arrives down at Aastrup mill, and he made such a ruckus and tipped over the beds and threw the people out of them, and made so much noise that they couldn’t stay there. He wanted the money back. He kept up like that for eight days and it got worse and worse. They go to the minister and they have the money with them and want the grave opened so they could put the money down there so they could get some peace. But the minister said no, that couldn’t be done, but he said he’d come to Aastrup that evening. The revenant came at a certain stroke of the clock and the minister came too. They talked to each other, the minister and the revenant, but they couldn’t agree, and so the minister conjured him down near the dike, and there’s a big flat stone that he was put underneath. Then they got peace at the mill. The road to Hjørring goes over precisely that dike and the stone is easily recognized.
