There was supposed to have been robbers in Rørbæk forest in Vester parish. It is said that they had a rope tied across the road that went through the forest. When somebody touched it, a bell rang down in their den, at which point they’d fly up and attack the traveler. One time a man came driving down the road with his wife and children. The robbers noticed this, so they attacked them and killed them all except for the little child, whom they did not have the heart to kill. But a little bit later a robber who had been away, and who was called Jørgen, came home. When he saw the child he said: “What’s this youngster; I’ll soon nick him!” at which point he grabbed the child and killed it. After that time, all the other robbers called him “Jørgen Nick.”
