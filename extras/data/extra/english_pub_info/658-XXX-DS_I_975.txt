In a birthing house, after everything was done with, the midwife lay down next to the mother who lay with her newborn child in her arms, and the other women sat on another bed. Soon they all fell asleep since they had been at it for a long time; but the birthing woman, who apparently wasn’t sleeping too soundly, wakes with some sort of rustling which she felt near her and she sees to her great horror that her child is gone. While she looks about, her eyes fall on the elf woman who is sitting on the threshold with her child and is in the process of throwing her legs over; because of their short legs they couldn’t get over the threshold in any other way. Then the birthing woman screamed loudly and cried with a loud voice: “That shall Jesus forbid you!” Then the elf woman dropped the child and disappeared. The birth woman jumped out of bed to get her child again and the midwife and the other women got so scared that they almost didn’t know what was going on. The father didn’t delay with getting the minister and having the child baptized.
