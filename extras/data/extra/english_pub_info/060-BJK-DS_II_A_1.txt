Adam first had a wife named Lillith, she could fly and she could swim, and when she had children, it was ten at a time. It was all these little elves, and they were so tiny. They got that name from their mother because she had all those lâ€™s in her name. The old ones wanted the Lord to make two people at a time, and so the Lord got tired of the woman who was called Lillith and made Eve, as told in the Bible.
