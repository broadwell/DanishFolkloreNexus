A knacker and a gelder lived in Hvalløs. The knacker and his wife didn’t have any children, but the gelder had two, a daughter and a son. There was a farmhand in service at his paternal aunt’s, who owned a farm here in the town, and he liked to visit the gelders since there were always things going on there. But the knacker and the gelder didn’t get along, because the gelders wanted to be considered honest people, and the knacker always called them dishonest; he was allowed to go to the altar, but he had to drink from the bottom of the chalice, and when he was out working with other people, he had to sit at the end of the table and eat. One evening, the farmhand was over there, and the knacker and the gelder’s people had both been in Randers the day before, and the gelder sat and told that they’d been in a fight with the knacker, and he was lying in Hvolbæk and hit been hit like this and like that, and couldn’t even walk. The gelders sat and amused themselves with this. But just as they were sitting there like this, the knacker threw open the door and yelled, “Get out of here you devils!” And then they jumped up and each one grabbed a long knife, and there was a huge murderous fight out there. The lights were extinguished and the farmhand didn’t know what to do, so he grabbed the table and held it over him, and sat in a corner with it until the row had ended. Then he got up, put the table down and sat down at it, and the lights were lit again, and there he sat at the table like before. He didn’t want to let on that he’d hidden. But then he quickly said goodnight and got out of there as soon as he could. His paternal aunt never liked that he went over there, and he didn’t go there after that, he’d had enough.
