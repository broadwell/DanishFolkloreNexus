A nisse lives in Besser church. He has his place in a bundle of cloth at the top of the church, but when they ring the church bell, he hides himself in a mound a little ways away. He occasionally plays one trick or another, which is taken out on someone or other who has offended him. One night, when the bell ringer came to ring the sun down, Mr. Nis played a little trick on him. When he tried to start ringing the bell, it wouldn’t make a sound. The bell ringer discovered that there was a big piece of cloth tied around the clapper. While he’s standing wondering about this, he sees a little grinning face on top of the bell with a red hat on.
