One time, Kristen Sø from Voldby tried his strength against England’s strongest man. The count at Frisenborg was in Copenhagen and was also up to visit the king. Here he met an English general with whom he fell into conversation. The general told him that he had a man who was so strong that nobody could beat him, and so they called him the “Giant Wrestler.” Then the count says that on his estate there was a man he didn’t think the Giant Wrestler could beat, but the general thought it would be easy. The end of it was that the count sent a message to Frisenborg, and the general one to England, that the two strong men were to meet in Copenhagen and try their strength. The day arrived, and they take a hold of one another. First, Kristen Sø sank to his knees, but then he says, “Hold on! You have to remember that I’m an old man, let’s get a good grip on each other!” but that time Kristen Sø laid the Englishman flat out on the ground, and then he said: “Let’s try that again.” The Englishman had to take one more trip to the ground. For that piece of work, Kristen Sø got two hundred rixdollars from the count.
