There was a similar story about a man from Rold, who was in the company of these elf hags. He was sleeping out in the forest burning charcoal, that was the practice in the olden days. When they bought timber in the forests, they always burned the top down to charcoal and had a large number of charcoal stacks to take care of. Now this man was out in the forest one night taking care of his stacks, and then this elf woman comes and pulls up her skirt and stands there warming herself by the stack. Then he thought that she should be warmed a bit better and he takes a stick out of the stack and pokes it at her. “What’s your name?” she says. “Myself,” he says. Well, then she yells out, “Fussibu and Trussitrold, Bukkjær hags and Aldåls boys, little pussy has been burned.” Just as she said that, all of those she had called stood there next to her. “Who did it?” they shouted. “Myself! Myself!” Then they thought that she’d done it herself, and it took so long to figure it out that the man had almost gotten home in the meantime, he’d thought it wisest to get out of there. Just as he’d gotten inside and closed the door, they were there and pounded on the door, but he was saved. The next morning, when he went out into the forest, all of his charcoal stacks had been smashed to pieces. They’d done that to him. Now it was in Rold forest that he burned charcoal, and Bukkjær and Aldal are a couple of places there in the forest. Aldal is just across from Stubberup and there was a road up the dale, but one year it collapsed almost completely. Trussitrold lived most likely in Try Lake, which is next to the road from Tveden to Rold, and Fussibuu probably lived in Fossi swamp, which is close to Fåre Lake. In the hill they called Stubberup House, lived elves. People hauled firewood there in the forest and burned charcoal stacks.
