Two men had made a bet about the extent to which women would gossip, the one said that they wouldn’t and the other one that they would. So then the first one says that he’d give it a try, but that the women weren’t to know that they’d made a bet. He made himself really sick the next morning and told his wife that a crow had flown out of him when he’d been out behind the barn for nature’s call a little while ago, and he had know idea what was going to happen to him he was so sick. His wife now goes over to the other man’s wife and tells her that two crows had flown out of him that morning while he was taking care of nature’s call and it was a really sorrowful thing. The neighbor wife comes back with her to see to him and then she goes back home, and she tells her husband that things were really wrong with the neighbor husband, because three crows had flown out of him that morning while he was out taking care of his needs. A little later, he goes over there himself, and the neighbor speaks up and asks him to pay the bet, because such and such had happened; he’d convinced his wife that he was sick and that a crow had flown out of him and his wife had blabbed it on. Then the neighbor shouts: “Well, then the devil should take those women, they both lie and gossip, she told me that three crows had flown out of you.”
