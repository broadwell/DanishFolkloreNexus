A woman who wasn’t terribly clever went over to the neighbor woman and said: “Can’t you give me some good advice for my sausages, I’ve poked and prodded them but now they creep (shrink) even out of the smoke.” Then the other woman answers: “Haven’t you forgotten to put salt in them?” “God I never would have remembered that!” The same woman came in another time to the neighbor woman and something had gone bad for her that day. Then the wise woman says, “Yeah, would that you had as much trouble as the woman who has endless yarn.” “Ha,” says the other one, “then I could spin with one and then I’d have two.” – “Thanks for the good advice. Lord knows I’ve sat here and wound this yarn for two days and I couldn’t find an end to it.”
     The same woman had a daughter who was just as clever as her mother. The day she turned twenty she came to her mother’s sister and said, “Moster, now I can make cheese...” “Well, then you are a clever little girl.”
