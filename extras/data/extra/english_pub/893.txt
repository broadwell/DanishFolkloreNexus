One time, a man stood in his doorway in Mølby, Spandet parish, and it was a little bit before the sun set. Then he saw a house fully engulfed in flames. Just as he called to his wife and the other people that they had to see this, it was all over. Now he became convinced that the Verresig house was going to burn, and he told others about it, and the man who lived there was quite upset by that story. But the man in Mølby died, and then the man in Verresig died, and the house was still standing. About eighty years after the fire had been seen the house burned one day just before sunset.
