A farmhand once lost his temper and killed a hired boy and buried him out in the field. He was missed but no one had any suspicions about the farmhand and several years passed. Then it happened that they had seeded the field where the dead boy lay buried. When the seed was mowed, the farmhand was at the very front of the mowing line, and his scythe got caught in something, and it stuck to the scythe. When he looked to see what it was, it was a human bone, and when he took it off the scythe, blood bled out of the bone. Now he admitted what he had done to the other people and suffered his punishment for his misdeed.
