They’ve heard somebody going out in Vesterkjær just west of Mollerup and fighting at night. It's the field markers that they are fighting about, and they say it's a couple of men who were called Kræn Pejersen and Kræn Rask. One time I came driving from Skanderborg at midnight. I heard something driving and plowing about three fields over from the road. I sat and watched it as I drove home along the highway, I saw the plow animals well enough, and they went as clearly as when our animals go and plow, but people, I didn’t see any. The couplings clinked, just like when oxen go with a chain up to the coupling of a plow. When it got to the woods, it turned and came back again. I almost said “Good evening” to it, before I figured out what it really was.
