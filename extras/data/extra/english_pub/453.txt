Half way between Martofte and Snave lies Peder Mose’s mound where dwarves used to live. One night, some young people went from Martofte to Snave to go to a Christmas party and they came close by the mound, and a daring young man among them had the impulse to call out: “Hey mound dwellers, do you want to come to a Christmas party in Snave?” Immediately they heard a yell from inside the mound: “Peder Mose get my hose (stockings), I’m going to Snave to a Christmas party!” But when they heard talking and a slamming of chest lids down there, they all got scared and hurried to Snave. A little later a little goblin appeared in the door and the people were even more surprised than they’d been before. But some of them invited him in and he also went in and joked around with them for a bit of the night.
