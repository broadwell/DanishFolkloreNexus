Fifty years ago, a farmhand who had been a cavalry soldier went out often at night to look for the horses and he had a rope in his pocket with a stick in it which he used for a bit. When it now happened that he came to a flock of horses, he gladly got up on the back of one of them. Once he found a mottled horse which was very beautiful. He sat up on it but it rode with him out into a mill pond so that he had to let himself drift back onto the bank. The horse disappeared into the pond with a huge snort when he had gotten off. Since then he never took horses to ride on again.
