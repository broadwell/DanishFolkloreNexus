A man and a woman, both young people, drove one winter night in overcast weather at midnight home from a visit. They sat alone in the wagon. Then the man says to the woman that he has to get off for a little bit and that she’d have to hold the horses. But before he got off, he took a hand-knit yellow scarf from his neck and tossed it to her, while he said that if something came, she should hit at it hard with that. Then he hops down from the wagon on the left side and goes into the woods. Soon thereafter a werewolf comes back, puts its forelegs up on the nearest front wheel and makes like it wants to come up into the wagon. She lashes out as hard as she can with the scarf for several minutes. Suddenly the animal makes an about face, scoots off into the bushes and disappears. Shortly thereafter the man comes back, gets up into the wagon and drives home. When they got into the living room, and the woman had lit a candle, she saw that there was a yellow woolen thread between the man’s teeth. Then she says, “But Per, you’re a werewolf.” “Yes, but not anymore, since now I am saved, Maren!.”
