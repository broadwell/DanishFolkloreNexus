There was once an old district governor in Skanderborg, who was called Grabe, and he did all sorts of black arts that people weren’t too happy about. When he was dead, they weren’t free of him in Skanderborg, he wandered about and made difficulties some times. Then they decided to have him conjured, and they got ahold of Slanter-Laust from Blegind, people used him a lot in those days, and when he came and found out about how it all hung together, he said: “Well, he’s dangerous and not easy to deal with; but I can probably stop him a bit.” They had to go out into the park and find an out-of-the-way place where they could hide him away. But now, since the minister had declared that he was that dangerous, people realized they hadn’t gotten rid of him since he was so close by. Then he asks if there’s anybody who knows the area well, where it would be the most difficult for the district governor to ride or however else he’d be traveling about. Then there were a couple who’d been out here with the royal huntsmen a couple of times on Tåning field, and they thought it would be difficult out there and then he was to be put there. That water hole isn’t too far from here and it’s an incredibly large depression which at that time was completely inaccessible. He drives out there with four black horses in front of his carriage, back and forth.
