A man accused another man’s wife of being a witch. Then the other man wanted his wife’s reputation cleared so he summoned the other man and his wife. When they came into court, a dog came to the door and scratched at it. Nobody would open the door for it, but then Anders Allehånde said: “If you won’t open up, then I will.” Then he opened the door. Then the dog came in and then Anders welcomed it and said her name. He said: “Welcome, Maren!” Then the woman who was summoned stood there naked beside her husband, and they could see that she was a witch.
