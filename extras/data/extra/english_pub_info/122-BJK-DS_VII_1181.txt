Calves couldn’t survive at a farm in Årestrup and so they got a witch master from the west, he was called Jens Ilder. He wrote a bunch of small notes and put them round about. Then there was a crack in the door post and he put one in there too. After, when the weather was windy, it had worked its way out and a hired boy got it and read, “Give your calves both straw and hay, if they won’t live, then let them die.”
