The men in Karlby were real drunks. When they drove to Århus, the wagon wheels roared, “Hoo! We never go to town.” To that, the man answered, “When we get to town, then you’ll get greased.” But then he got drunk and forgot to grease them. Now they went home quickly and then the wheels said, “You promised me something, but I didn’t get it, you promised me something, but I didn’t get it.”
