A mound man and his family lived in Dagbjærg Dås. It happened once that a man who came riding by there got the impulse to ask the mound woman for a little to drink. She went after the requested drink but her husband advised her to tap from the poisonous cask. The traveler heard this in the meantime and when the mound woman hands him the cup with the drink, he throws the contents over his shoulder and rides away with the cup in his hand, as fast as the horse can run. The mound woman tosses her breasts over her shoulder and ran after him as well as she could. When he reached the place where Karup river cuts across the highway from Viborg to Holstebro, she was so close to him that she snagged a calk (hage) of the horse’s shoe and from that time on the place is called Hage bridge. The mound woman couldn’t cross over the running water and the man was saved. Later it turned out that a few drops of the drink had fallen on the horse’s rump and had taken off both hide and hair.
