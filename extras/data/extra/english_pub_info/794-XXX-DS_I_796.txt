The mound dwellers from Bjærg were related to those from Grønhøj. One Christmas Eve, a man came driving from Randers, he was from Vinstrup and was called Ajs Josten. Then a woman came out of the mound and offered him a drink of beer from a silver cup but he tossed the beer out behind himself and said “giddy-up” and drove off since he wanted to keep the cup. There was a big rye field up to Vindstrup and he set out across it, it's not too far from the mound to the town and the mound troll couldn’t go over that but had to go around. He also got into the farm and got the gate closed before they got there. Then they had to go away and then he had the silver cup. It was put out on the table when Christmas eve came again, they were to have a drink from it. Then an old woman came and she wanted to stay there that night ... that could happen in those days ... and then she was also to taste the beer from the silver cup. But at the same time, the door burst open and then the hag was off with the silver mug without hesitation. “Easy come, easy go,” said the man, and then there was no more about that.
