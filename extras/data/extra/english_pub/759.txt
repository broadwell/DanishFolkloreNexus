An old woman who was called Ellen Bisp went to Birkfuldsdal to get her cow which was grazing there. When she got to the place, she noticed three small girls with white aprons. She had heard that some girls went there and collected juniper berries and she thought that it was them and said that they didn’t have to be afraid of her since she wouldn’t report them to the forest ranger. But when she’d said that, they suddenly disappeared from her sight and then she knew that they were elf maidens.
