It was in 1812 when the Cossacks were here, that two Jews came to Fårhus Inn late one night. They had come by wagon and had all their wares with them. The inn was owned by two brothers and a sister, and they soon paid off their large debt, just as two good horses were sold by the innkeepers at Flensborg market three days after the Jews had arrived. Three years later, they sold the inn and settled in Øster-Løgum, where each of the brothers bought a farm. The sister stayed married and was still poor, but when she needed money, and they sat playing cards in Øster-Løgum Inn, she would go to them and say, "I need some money." -- "Well, it doesn't matter to us that you're our sister," they answered. "Well," she says, "I don't want to beg for it, and if you won't do it, then I know something else I can do. You know darn well what you were party to." Then they each reached into their pockets and gave her some money. "You always have such a strange way about coming for money," they said. "Well, I need to use the methods that I can, since you won't do it by yourselves." -- "Just go." -- "Sure, I'll go for now." When one of the brothers had died and was to be buried, the minister said, "Lord save me from saying what this man confessed in his last moment, as many of his family is here by the graveside, but we hope that he will be blessed." In 1867 something was found in a copper kettle down in the swamp near Fårehus, bones and green clothes, and everything pointed toward it being here that the two Jews had been dumped. The physician from Åbenrå declared that they were human bones and the skulls looked like the Jews too.
     Strange enough, there had been strong omens there ahead of time. There had been screaming and moaning and in my youth no one dared go past that swamp. But when the things were dug up, the omens stopped.
