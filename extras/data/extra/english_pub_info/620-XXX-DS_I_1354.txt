A troll lived in Pigs mound near Tor√∏hus. He was known by a lot of people. One time, a skipper met him on the open sea, where the troll came sailing in a boot. He told the sailor that people on Fyn had become so wise that they made the sign of the cross over everything, so the trolls couldn't get anything to live off of. So that was why he was going to Norway where he didn't think people were so enlightened.
