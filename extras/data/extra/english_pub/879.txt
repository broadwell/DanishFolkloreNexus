At Bavnehøj mill, the farmhand disappeared suddenly. People believed that somebody had killed him and burned his body in the baker’s oven. Since then, it was haunted there and a little later the owner sold the mill. The new owner’s brother visited there and was going to sleep there at night. He woke up to see two people fighting by the bed. All of the doors and windows had sprung open and there was a huge commotion.
