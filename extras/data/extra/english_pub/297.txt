One evening they were sitting in Nielstrup telling stories about a headless animal running up and down the street in Hvalløs. Then there were some who said that it wasn’t true. Then Ras Bødker gets really annoyed and said that it was true because when he stood and cut chafe by moonlight out in the chafe house, it would come and stick its head in through the window.
