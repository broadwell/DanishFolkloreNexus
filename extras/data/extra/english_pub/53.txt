There was a spook that looked like an old hag. She came driving in a half wagon with a horse before it and she had a little angry red whip in her hand. They called it, “Her in the half wagon.” She came from the north and drove down along Ledkrogen and then up past Per Ingvarsen’s and then along the road to the Skovhul (Woods hollow). Then one night Per Ingvarsen’s farmhand and hired girl stood talking to each other and then the girl says that she wanted him to lay with her in the half wagon that night. But before they knew it, something came and took his dog and threw him up against the room door. Then Per Ingvarsen got annoyed and gave them a lot of grief, and then he hurried and made a cross over the door and jabbed a knife into the doorpost.
