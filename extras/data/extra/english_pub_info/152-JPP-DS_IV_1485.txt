A soldier had received leave for two or three days and had been given permission to take his sword with him, they weren't usually allowed to in those days. He intended to go to Jerslev and so he goes in and gets himself a dram at the inn. Then a farmer comes driving along, and he’s also headed up north. So then the soldier asks the farmer if he can ride along with him. Yeah, he could sure enough, because the road wasn't always so nice through the Østbjærg hills, and he had just been in Ålborg and gotten some money which he had with him. Then they start driving and when they get into the woods, they get surrounded by three robbers. Two of them jump each to one side of the horses and grab hold of them, and the third tries to jump up in the wagon. But then the soldier draws his sword and chops a finger off of him, and it remains lying in the wagon. When that happened, all three of them galloped away.
