It was while Pastor Buhmann was minister in Voldum and Rude, he would always go into my grandfather’s house near Rude church and change his clothes. One day a man and a woman came in. Then the wife there at the house asks the woman visitor, “Where are you going today?” – “We want to bring our little boy to church.” – “Who is going to carry him?” – “I’ll do that, little Dårrit.” – “Well who is going to take his hat off?” – “Well, you’ll do that little Dårrit. I’m also going to be churched today.” – “Well, who is going to follow you to church, Jaahan?” – “Well, you’ll do that too little Dårrit.” “Well, I don’t know about that, if we can do all of that, Jaahan. Who is going to be the baptismal witness?” “Well Kræsten’s gone up to the church to get a hold of someone.” Then the house wife goes up to the minister, he was putting on his vestments and was going to go up to the church, they used to call the ministers “Father” in those days, and she says to him: “What does Father say to that? Jaahan has come and wants to bring her boy to church, and she wants to carry him herself and she wants me to take the cap off, and she also wants to be churched and have me stand beside her. Do you think we can do that, Father?” – “Yes, we can certainly do that Dårrit,” says the minister. So when they get up there and they’re standing by the baptismal font, she almost forgot what the child was named. When they left the church, she says, “Wow, you could easily have forgotten what the child was to be named, Jahan.” Then she cleared her throat and spit and said, “It got caught in my throat little Dårrit.” Then she said to the boy, “Now little Kristjan, now you can say, di fåe hå wått di faje, di måwe di bæærmåwe.” “your father has been your baptismal witness and your mother your carrying mother (godmother).”
