Ramten mill is in Nimtoft where a lot of rich people used to live. Many years ago there was a miller who also had ships at sea. The mill belonged at that time to Mejlgård, and the manor lord there was accused of both robbing people on the highways himself and being connected to a robber band that lodged in Nørre province. Even though the miller paid his debts promptly each due date, the manor lord always looked at him with evil eyes, probably because of the miller’s wealth. Then it happened one night that the robbers attacked the mill, beat up the man and his wife and, after they had plundered everything that there was, they set the farm on fire. The miller complained to the manor lord, who was his master, even though he suspected that the manor lord was behind it and, as he anticipated, the manor lord did nothing about the case. But several years later, a robber band was caught in Fjeld forest, and they were decapitated near Skindvad up in Nørre province. Before they were executed, they admitted that they had committed the break-in at Ramten mill after consultation with the manor lord, and he had paid them something to commit the crime. 
     The mill doesn’t exist any more, but the mill pond is there. For many years, it was just a little farm, but now it has been made into a stamping mill.
