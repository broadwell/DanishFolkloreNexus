Jens Plovgård's wife Maren in Ramme was also a witch and when she was going to churn, she put the empty churn in the room and then she said, "Now, in God's name, a spoonful from each man and a bowlful from Rammegård." Then the churn would be filled and she'd get wonderful butter. One day, when she wasn't home, her daughter was going to churn, but she was more demanding than her mother and said, "A bowlful from each man and a bucketful from Rammegård." She wound up standing there with cream half way up her waist.
