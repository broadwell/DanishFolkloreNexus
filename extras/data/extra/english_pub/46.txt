The viper king was entirely white and had a red head. It was the only female in the entire den, so it’s the same as with bees. A horse dealer had gotten ahold of one once, and wanted to cook and eat it, because then he’d have been able to see down into the ground as deep as he was tall, and he’d be able to see calves inside cows too. Then he goes in one place and he wants this viper king prepared. They had a little girl there who stood there chewing on a piece of bread. It falls down into the pot and she picks it up and continues to chew on it. Then she could see through the walls that the horse dealer was sitting next to the wood burning stove, and she could also see if there were white or dappled calves inside the cows. Now the horse dealer wanted to buy the girl from the people, but they wouldn’t sell her.
