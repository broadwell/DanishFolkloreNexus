There’s a story about robbers who are supposed to be the descendants of those who were in the robber dens in Borris. In Wåtkjær, all the people were in church one day, except an old woman. Then she sees the robbers are coming and she quickly locks the doors. A little boy who was walking outside, they threatened to kill him, unless she opened up. Then she let them in and one of them went over to an old chest. She was told to open it. Then she convinced one of the robbers that there was money in a bag in the chest so the man rummages down in it, but she takes his legs and tosses him down on his head into it and then locks the chest. So then she had gotten rid of him and at the same time the people came back from church. A message came to Lundenæs and they brought their people and caught them.
