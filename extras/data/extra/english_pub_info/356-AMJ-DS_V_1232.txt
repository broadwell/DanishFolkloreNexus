All the way out on the parsonage’s field in Skjødstrup there’s Galgeknolden (Gallows knoll). A little girl was executed there in my time, she’d killed a baby. My father wanted me to go down and see it, but I cried so terribly and I didn’t want to. Afterward, they saw the girl sitting with her baby on top of the ground right on the knoll itself. Then pastor Katrup had to go down there and conjure her.
