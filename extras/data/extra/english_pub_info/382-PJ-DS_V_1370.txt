A young man, about seventeen or eighteen years old, who was quite brave, went along a road one moonlit night about midnight. As he’s walking along, he meets a woman who is standing digging furiously in the side of a hill. Then he says, “God help you!” It didn’t answer. He said it again. It still didn’t answer. The he says it a third time. Then it puts the shovel down and comes over to him. Now he got scared and started to walk. It followed him, no matter fast he went, it would go just as fast, but he couldn’t see that it moved its legs. Finally he comes to an intersection and now either she couldn’t cross it, or however it was, it’s enough to know that she walks over to him and puts one hand on his chest and the other on his back, and then she laughed right in his face, and she opened her mouth incredibly wide, and looking into her eyes was like looking into two holes. Then she let go of him and disappeared. He got home but he was sick and he had to stay in bed for quite a while after that walk. When he told others about it, he said, “You better believe that I let people who I meet do their work, since I’ve never in all my days forgotten that.” It was out past Flensted heath this happened.
