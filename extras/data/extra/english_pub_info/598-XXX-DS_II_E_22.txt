Lindkjær is the name of a big peat bog which belongs to the Ravnholdt estate. In olden days there was supposed to be a big lindorm in the bog, and it’s described like a terrible monster. It was the size of a hitching post or loading stock, and nobody dared get near to its lair. A man who once got too close to the bog was pursued by the terrible snake all the way to Ryslinge, which is about a mile from there. In his despair, the man climbed up into the church tower there and the lindorm couldn’t follow him. It attempted to knock the church over with its tail but couldn’t do it. The man, who with great fright saw that it was hitting the church and that it reached nearly up to the sound holes when it stood on its tail, escaped alive from there. Finally, a sharpshooter from Ravnholt was supposed to have shot the lindorm and thus freed the district of it.
