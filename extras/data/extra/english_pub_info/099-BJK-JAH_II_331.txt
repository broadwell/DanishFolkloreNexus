Niels Mortensen from here in Ersted bought two farms from the war counselor at Nörlund for 1300 daler. When he was to go to Nibe to pay the money, a man in Torsted told a grocer in Nibe, “There walks a man with 1300 daler in his pocket.” – “Hah, I wouldn’t even consider entrusting him with a half pint.” He was dressed really poorly, in uncolored homespun.
