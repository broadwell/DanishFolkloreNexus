    <annotation>The merman appears here as a helpful spirit, akin to the mound dwellers who warn the farmer of impending doom, after he restores the roof of their house (JPP 4.43). The story of giving or returning a glove to a merman and in return being warned of a storm is widely attested (DS II D 8). Christiansen (1958) indexes these stories as ML4055, and emphasizes the "tit for tat" nature of the exchange. In other stories, it is a stocking that is given to the merfolk (DS II D 4). Many of the stories include a rhyme that the merman or mermaid quotes warning the fisherman of impending disaster. Lindow mentions an early attestation of the story in the 16th century, Historia de gentibus septentrionalis II, 23, by Olaus Magnus (Lindow 1978, 127).

     Merfolk and mound dwellers appear analogous in many stories, with each one residing in groups organized in ways reminiscent of Danish social organization. The mound dwellers appear in the context of human agricultural endeavor (plowing and animal herding for example) while merfolk appear in the context of fishing. 

     This story was collected by Karl Hjort, a teacher in &#xC5;restrup, and not by Tang Kristensen. It appears in the Dansk Folkemindesamling collection 1929/001, "Originalopskrifter af Folkeminder indsendte til E.T.K. Heri Bidrag indsendt til Folkemindesamfundet samt senere Bidrag. Ordnede alfabetisk efter Indsendernes Navne." [Original recordings of folklore sent to E. T. K. Including material sent to the Folklore Society as well as later materials. Arranged alphabetically according to the sender's name]. An annotation for Karl Hjort made in March 1992 lists 52 sheets in that collection attributed to him. Among Hjort's collections are eleven melodies to Jens's ballads. Tang Kristensen did not collect any of Jens's melodies himself. It is likely that Hjort was a contributor to the journal Skattegraveren as well.

     Tang Kristensen mentions Karl Hjort (1848-1890) several times in his memoirs (MO II, 366; III, 29, 78, 82, 183, 260, 349). Hjort was a widower and, according to Tang Kristensen, doted on his only son. He was greatly interested in folklore and was quite musical; this likely accounts for the various ballads that he recorded and that are included in Tang Kristensen's Jyske folkeminder vol. 11 (JFm XI). Tang Kristensen considered him "en god st&#xF8;tte" [a good support]. He often followed Tang Kristensen out to "Bitte Jens" (MO III, 82). Tang Kristensen usually stayed with Hjort when he visited &#xC5;restrup and Jens (MO III, 82 and 183). Hjort died of tuberculosis in 1890 (MO III, 349). Tang Kristensen makes no mention of receiving any manuscripts from Hjort, although he does mention that they corresponded (MO III, 349), and it is likely in this correspondence that he included the two records attributed to him. Hjort is also mentioned in DgF (XII 237) as a collector (and not as an informant). He is also mentioned in L&#xE6;rerne og samfundet (Poulsen and Benthin 1913, vol. 1, 145f).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was once a fisherman on the West Sea who found a glove on the beach. He brought it home to his wife and had her knit one just like it, then he went back and put both gloves on the beach again, and then he went out to fish. Then something shouted: 
They're shouting in the north
and they're whistling and blowing
go to land, you man 
who knitted the glove 
Then the fisherman hurried to land. Immediately a storm blew up that was so bad that many fishermen drowned, but the man was saved because he'd given the merman the glove.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>These amusing phrases, collected by Karl Hjort, all rely on twisting the meaning of words, or using formulations and phrasing known from church services to make risqu&#xE9; statements. The Christmas celebrations and similar lejestuer [festive celebrations] held at various farms were one of the few chances for unmarried men and women of the parish to gather in an informal and non-work setting.

Tang Kristensen has written a long introduction to this record:

Following here are certain formula that have been used at Christmas gatherings, and are deliberate twisting of expressions. While they appear to make fun of the holy word, they should rather be considered examples of youthful self confidence and enthusiasm. Several of these formula also have obscene or vulgar sections. In earlier times people didn't take this as seriously, and it often happened that, if such sentences were presented in a jocular manner, they could lead to great amusement. In particular, they would perform marriages and baptisms, imitating, using other words, church functions, into which they would infuse amusement. Twisted invitations to births or weddings were also common at these occasions and, since I have a large number of them at hand, and since there is now occasion to give some examples, they follow here as well. One should note that many of them, perhaps because of later misunderstandings, have been woven into other nonsense rhymes, so all of it has in fact become nonsense now. I refer to my book, Molbo- og Aggerbohistorier, the section on Lying Nonsense (MA I, 108-120, MA II, 112-126).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Wedding vows: Just as the hoopoe with its beautiful crown or the peacock with its gilded feathers and spotted legs, that is exactly how your hastily dolled up bride and groom appear to me today. Love burns in my heart for her, just like the cat when he sees a sausage, or the fox when he sees a sour cheese or a grey goose in his eyes, or in front of his eyes, you, the most beautiful among mankind's daughters. But I am afraid that he will say, just as Moses says it in the fifth, backwards in the twenty-eighth, "You shall take wife, but others shall sleep with her." Those are the words of the text. And so I ask you, you honorless and greatly scorned young man, Mikkel Husl&#xF8;s [Homeless], if you have asked counsel of your family, friends, the toll taker in Viborg or the police commander in Aalborg whether you should take the honorless and greatly scorned young woman, Sidsel Sluwp, who stands by your side? Then give each other your feet. - I ask you to keep your marriage so that it is not with you like the sow that walks on the street: when you scratch her underbelly, she lies down, or like the grey mare who stands on the hill, when she's eaten her stomach full, she shits a trough full. But you should be wild and crazy, quick and snappy, bite and scratch about yourselves, then your sins will fall from you, like cow shit tumbles off of high mountains. It was written in St. Paul's epistel to the Romans, that toll, just as in your mother's skirt in the third wrinkle from her bum. Amen!</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Heretter f&#xF6;lger nogle formularer, som man har brugt i julestuerne, og som er lutter forvr&#xE6;ngelser, der ser ud som spot mod det hellige, men dog n&#xE6;rmest m&#xE5; betragtes som udslag af k&#xE5;dhed og ungdomsovermod og -lystighed. Adskillige af disse formularer havde endog us&#xF8;mmelige eller platte afsnit. I forrige tider tog man det ikke s&#xE5; n&#xF6;je hermed, og det var ikke fri, at slige s&#xE6;tninger, n&#xE5;r de blev vittigt fremsatte, vakte den st&#xF6;rste morskab. S&#xE6;rlig brugte man at &#xE6;gtevie og at d&#xF8;be, efterlignede alts&#xE5; de kirkelige handlinger, hvortil der kunde knyttes munterhed. Forvr&#xE6;ngede indbydelser til barsel og bryllup bragtes ogs&#xE5; ved samme lejlighed, og da jeg har en stor masse af dem liggende, og der her er anledning til at give pr&#xF8;ver af dem, f&#xF8;lger de med. Men man m&#xE6;rke sig. at flere af dem m&#xE5;ske p&#xE5; grund af senere misforst&#xE5;else er blevne indv&#xE6;vede i andre vr&#xF6;vleremser, s&#xE5; det hele nu egentlig er blevet til vr&#xF6;vl.
Her henvises for&#xF6;vrigt til min bog: Molbo- og Aggerbohistorier, afsnittet: L&#xF6;gnevr&#xF6;vl.
En brudevielse. Ligesom h&#xE6;rfuglen, der har en dejlig krands, eller p&#xE5;fuglen, der har forgyldte fjer og skurvede ben, ligeledes forekommer mig i dag om eders pludselige udstafferede brud og brudgom. Elskovsgl&#xE6;de br&#xE6;nder i mit hj&#xE6;rte til hende, ligesom katten, n&#xE5;r han ser en medisterp&#xF8;lse, eller mikkel r&#xE6;v, nar han ser en sur ost eller en gr&#xE5;g&#xE5;s i hans &#xF6;jne eller for hans &#xF6;jne, du den dejligste blandt menneskenes d&#xF6;tre. Men jeg frygter for, at han skal komme til at sige, ligesom Moses siger i det 5. bagvendt i det 28.: "Du skal trolove dig en hustru, men andre skal sove hos hende." Det er textens ord.
S&#xE5; tilsp&#xF6;rger jeg dig, du &#xE6;rel&#xF8;se og velforagtede ungkarl Mikkel Husl&#xF8;s, om du har ber&#xE5;dt dig med din sl&#xE6;gt og venner ligesom tolderen i Viborg eller overbetjenten i Aalborg, om du vil have den &#xE6;rel&#xF8;se og velforagtede ungpige Sidsel Sluwp... som st&#xE5;r ved din side? S&#xE5; giv hverandre derp&#xE5; eders f&#xF6;dder. &#x2014; Jeg beder eder, at I holder eder i eders &#xE6;gtestand, at det ikke er med eder som soen, der g&#xE5;r p&#xE5; gaden: n&#xE5;r man klor hende under maven, s&#xE5; l&#xE6;gger hun sig, eller som den gr&#xE5;, der st&#xE5;r p&#xE5; bakken: n&#xE5;r hun &#xE6;der en bugfuld, s&#xE5; sk... hun et trugfuld. Men I skulle v&#xE6;re vilde og gale, rappe og snappe, bide og slide omkring eder, s&#xE5; skal eders synder falde fra eder som kaivel... en triller ned af h&#xF6;je bj&#xE6;rge. Det stod skrevet i st. Povls kjortel til de Romler, den told, som i din moders det gr&#xF6;nne skj&#xF6;rt i den tredje rynke fra rumpen. Amen!</danish_publication>

    <annotation>Stories of failed cures call into question the abilities of cunning folk to cure ills and to drive away the Devil. The hired girl, who lets her curiosity get the better of her, may implicitly have a hand in the failure, since other legends attest to the ruinous consequences of people witnessing interactions between wise ministers or cunning folk and the Devil (JPP 2.15). At the same time, the girl's curiosity makes the first hand narrative possible. The outcome of the encounter--the boy's death--seems to be included almost as an afterthought. The interaction between Yww Luet and the Devil is reminiscent of the interaction between the Bragholt Hag, a cunning woman, and the Devil in a story told by Jens Peter Pedersen (JPP 2.07).

     Yww Luet-or Ivar Laust-is not mentioned in R&#xF8;rbye's study of cunning folk (R&#xF8;rbye 1976). The use of the term "hekse-mester" [witch master] should be seen as an ideological evaluation of Ivar Laust's abilities, ascribing him the status of witch as opposed to that of cunning man, the term used at the start of the story (when there was still hope for a cure).

     This story is neither found in the diaries nor in the fair copy collection. It is also not in the fair copy of the stories sent to Tang Kristensen by Karl Hjort.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>My uncle&#x2019;s son in Lille-Arden was bewitched, and then they took him to a cunning man, they called Yww Luet (Iver L..t). He came and then everybody had to go to bed because if anybody stayed up, it wouldn&#x2019;t work. The cunning man was to talk to the Old One. But they had a big girl there who&#x2019;d also gone to bed and was supposed to be asleep, but she was curious, as such people always are, and she lay with the comforter over her head and looked out to see what Ywer was doing. He sat at the table with a bottle of brandy in front of him and took a swig and mixed the medicines that were to be used for this witchcraft. After he&#x2019;d mixed something, he'd say, &#x201C;Is it strong enough?&#x201D; Then there were three knocks on the ceiling and then he stopped. Ever since then, the girl said, &#x201C;If the Devil wasn&#x2019;t at my father&#x2019;s farm that night, then he's never been there.&#x201D; But the boy died, the witch master didn&#x2019;t manage to cure him.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Jens begins his first session with a variant of the ballad "Skipper og Jomfru" (Skipper and Maiden). The girl is tricked into sailing off with the King, and he holds her hostage until she bears him children. In other variants, the girl escapes, often by jumping into the water.

     Tang Kristensen's manuscript includes a verse at the end of the performance, set apart in parentheses. In the printed version in JFm X, the verse appears as verse 8. In JFm X, he notes another variant, in which two variant verses, 6 and 7, were performed: "Ja jeg kan se paa din r&#xF8;de Rosenkind/at aldrig har du kyst noget Smaabarns Kind//Kong Valdemar han taler til en af sin' Smaadreng':/I bringer mig baad' Mj&#xF8;d og klaren Vin!" [Well I can see by your red cheeks/that you have never kissed a small child's cheek//King Valdemar he speaks to one of his small boys/Bring me both mead and clear wine!]. These would have replaced Jens's verses 6-8. The change from Vallivand to Valdemar in this second variant is attested in other variants as well (DgF 241 Lc).

     There are numerous variants of this ballad recorded in DgF. Grundtvig proposes three main groups for the ballad, and Jens's version belongs to group C, in which the emphasis is on the King, and the girl does not escape (DgF 10, 602-9 ).</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens's next ballad, classified as a sk&#xE6;mtevise or joking ballad, is a clear satire on the romantic ballads that were quite popular at the time. It does not appear in DgF. The use of formula known from other ballads (saddling the gray steed for example), along with the insect protagonists, combine to make a song that most audiences would have recognized as satire.

     Tang Kristensen makes some slight changes in the published version, interpolating several lines, likely in an attempt to make the structure of the ballad more regular or to make the variant "more complete."</annotation>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen makes an annotation, likely as a note to remind himself of the ballads Jens had sung, so that he could record them fully at a slower pace. See BJK 1.32 and 1.37 for similar types of annotations. The first reference, forty weeks, likely refers to BJK 1.06. The second annotation, "Bj&#xF8;rrem.", may be a reference to a mound dweller.

    <annotation>This longish ballad about a girl seduced by a count does not appear in DgF. The count repents his harsh treatment of little Lise--a treatment reminiscent of the treatment the girl receives in the "Skipper and Maiden" ballad (BJK 1.01), and tries to set things right. As is common in ballads, the count arrives too late, and instead he sacrifices himself and is buried beside her. In legend tradition, the count's suicide would not be considered a positive representation of the depths of his repentance--rather it would be considered a horrifying act. Both he and Lise would be candidates for haunting. The underlying story is somewhat akin to stories about the revenant of a farmhand who returns from the dead to claim his fiance (JPP 2.18; DS II G 219 and 221)--here, the count consigns himself to death to be with his lover and child.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>I slept with a count last night
he had secretly charmed me
-hej fallit faldera, hej come faldera
he had secretly charmed me

&#x201C;No, I did not charm you,
I would have gladly paid you

I will give you my stable boy
and two thousands Ducats as well&#x201D;

&#x201C;No, if I cannot have my lord
then I will go home to my mother&#x201D;

And when I came to my father&#x2019;s farm
my dear mother is standing there in the gate

&#x201C;Welcome my daughter so fair and fine,
how did your trip treat you?&#x201D;

&#x201C;My travel treated me so,
that now I am going to have a child.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Do you like mead, do you like wine,
or rather the brown muscatels&#x201D;

&#x201C;No, I neither like mead nor wine,
nor the brown muscatels.

What I like best is a well made bed
where my limbs can rest.&#x201D;

That count he dreamed at night, as he lay
that little Lise had died from great sorrow

That count he spoke to his stable boy,
&#x201C;Saddle me and you a pair of horses.

And then we&#x2019;ll ride both night and day
until we can find little Lise

Then they rode out on the road
and then they heard the bells ringing

That count he speaks to his stable boy:
&#x201C;What can these bells mean?&#x201D;

&#x201C;These bells can only mean
that now a corpse now must be.&#x201D;

Yes, then they rode a little farther,
and they came to those diggers who dug

&#x201C;And listen, you diggers, you fine diggers!
for whom are you digging these graves?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Yes, that is for a maiden so fair and fine,
in life she was called little Lise.&#x201D;

&#x201C;And is it little Lise you are digging for,
then God has eased her sorrow.

Then you should make that grave so wide and so broad,
that two can rest in it.&#x201D;

Yes, then they rode a little farther
they came to some pallbearers, who bore

&#x201C;And listen you pallbearers, you fine pallbearers!
who is it that you are carrying on the pall?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Yes, it is a maiden so fair and fine,
in life she was called little Lise.&#x201D;

&#x201C;For my sake, she has suffered great need,
for her I will suffer great sorrow.&#x201D;

Then he put his spear up against a rock
and stuck it in his side.

Then they took that count, as bloody as he was
and lay him by the maiden&#x2019;s side
And lay him by the maiden&#x2019;s side</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>This amusing ballad focuses on the absurd situation that the two simpletons, Mads (Mas) and Lars (Las), find themselves in, and their obtuse responses to each others queries. In Jens's version, Mads takes the role of initiator, with Lars following his lead. The published variants reverse these roles. The main punchline revolves around the thieves' assault on Mads's testicles (Lars's testicles in the published version). In several variants (Ea, Ed, Ef-g), the thieves bite his testicles. The ballad becomes risqu&#xE9; when the young woman helps repair the injured scrotum.

     The published version, version E, is a compilation of a thirteen variants. Jens's variant is recorded as variant "d." Tang Kristensen includes four other types of this particular ballad. He acknowledges a great degree of variation between these versions, particularly in the "E" variants. He notes that Jens's ending to the ballad is quite unusual.

     In the manuscript, Tang Kristensen identifies another informant who knew the song--in all likelihood, Jens told him of this other informant. There is no indication in the field diaries or Minder og Oplevelser that Tang Kristensen attempted to follow up on this lead.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Las and Mas went into the forest
-Huhej because it is dawn again
there they saw the gray bear standing by the alder tree.
Let&#x2019;s shoot him, said Mas
Yeah let&#x2019;s, said Las
They walked carefree together through the grove

Yes, Mas wanted to get up on the bear to flay
his whittling knife couldn&#x2019;t bite into it
GIve us the whetstone said Mas
Here you go said Las

And now when they&#x2019;d flayed that bear skin
there were fifteen holes in it
Let&#x2019;s sell it said Mas

Yeah, let&#x2019;s, said Las

Yes Mas threw that skin on his back
and they headed off to the market town
Do you think we can sell it, said Mas
Yeah, I&#x2019;m sure we can said Las

But as they walked along the road
they met four thugs or five
They probably want it said Mas
Well let them take it then said Las
Yes three in front and two behind
And so they stole the skin from Mas&#x2019;s back
Now they have it said Mas
I&#x2019;ll say says Las
The three were grey and the two were black
and they shortened Mas&#x2019;s balls
That hurts, said Mas
I&#x2019;ll bet it does, said Las

Then they went the fastest way as before
and they met the most beautiful young girl
Whisper to her said Mas
Yeah sure said Las
And Mas he whispered in the girl&#x2019;s ear
if she couldn&#x2019;t fix a pair of balls
She wants to see them said Mas
I&#x2019;ll bet said Las

Mas went into an inn
There sat fifteen tailors and drank themselves drunk
Drink to me, said Mas
Yeah, do, said Las
And why should we drink to you
and do you have anything to give for that
I don&#x2019;t said Mas
There you go said Las

"Di vil missel ha 'en," s&#xE5; Las.
&#x2014; "Ja, de t&#xF8;kkes a", s&#xE5; Mas.

    <english_publication>Las, he whispered into his dear&#x2019;s ear,
--Hey hey, dawn is breaking again
shouldn&#x2019;t they have themselves a birth celebration
&#x201C;Well, do we have meat?&#x201D; said he, Las
---&#x201C;Well, we&#x2019;ll get some, &#x201C; said he, Mas
As they walked together carefree through the grove

Las wanted to go through the forest,
to catch an animal was his goal.
&#x201C;I think I&#x2019;ll go with you,&#x201D; said Mas
&#x201C;Sure, you certainly can,&#x201D; said Las

Las put his rifle on his back
and then they went into the forest in good spirits.
&#x201C;Here I come,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Me too,&#x201D; said Mas.

Now when they got into that forest,
they saw a bear lying there asleep.
&#x201C;Should I shoot him?&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Yes, you can.&#x201D; said Mas.

Las put his rifle on his knee,
and then he shot that bear that lay under that tree.
&#x201C;There he lies,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;d say so,&#x201D; said Mas.

They went over to the bear to flay,
but his whittling knife couldn&#x2019;t bite into it.
&#x201C;Give me your wheststone,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Here you go,&#x201D; said Mas.

Now when they&#x2019;d gotten the skin off,
there were fifteen holes in it.
&#x201C;I think we should sell it,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;That would be fine,&#x201D; said Mas.

Las threw the skin on his back, 
and off they headed to the market town.
&#x201C;Do you think we can sell it,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;m sure we can,&#x201D; said Mas.

But as they went along the road,
they met four or five thugs.
&#x201C;They probably want it.&#x201D; said Las,
--&#x201C;Yes, I think so,&#x201D; said Mas.

Well, two in front and three behind,
then they tore the skin from Las&#x2019;s back.
&#x201C;Now they&#x2019;re taking it,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Yes, they took it,&#x201D; said Mas. 

Las wanted to climb over that fence
and his balls wound up on a post
&#x201C;Oh my, there they hang,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Yes, I think so,&#x201D; said Mas.

Then when they got to the market town street,
they met up with a baker woman.
&#x201C;Should I talk to her,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;Yes, I think that&#x2019;s best,&#x201D; said Mas.

Las whispered in the old woman&#x2019;s ear,
&#x201C;Can you fix me a pair of balls?&#x201D;
&#x201C;What did she say?&#x201D; said Mas.
--&#x201C;She said yes,&#x201D; said Las.

And she poked out and she poked in,
and it hurt in Las&#x2019;s skin
&#x201C;That hurts,&#x201D; said he, Las.
--&#x201C;I can imagine,&#x201D; said Mas.

For fifteen nights and fourteen days,
Las&#x2019;s balls lay in a bread pan
&#x201C;How are things?&#x201D; said Mas
--&#x201C;Oh, not too bad,&#x201D; said Las.

Las looked in through the window,
--Hey hey, dawn is breaking again
all his women hopped in the alcoves
&#x201C;I think they&#x2019;re crazy,&#x201D; said Las.
--&#x201C;They probably are,&#x201D; said Mas.
As they walked together carefree through the grove

E version:
Then they went the closest way as before
and they met the most beautiful young girl
&#x201C;Whisper to her,&#x201D; said Las.&#x2014;&#x201C;Yeah, sure,&#x201D; said Mas.
And Las whispered into the girl&#x2019;s ear,
if she couldn&#x2019;t fix his pair of balls.
&#x201C;She wants to see.&#x201D; said Las. &#x2013; &#x201C;Yeah, sure,&#x201D; said Mas.
Las went into an inn,
there sat fifteen tailors and drank themselves drunk.
&#x201C;Drink to me,&#x201D; said Las. &#x2013; &#x201C;Yeah, sure,&#x201D; said Mas.
And why should we drink to you,
and do you have something to give for that,
&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201D; said Las. &#x2013; &#x201C;There you go,&#x201D; said Mas.</english_publication>

    <annotation>In a ballad not included in DgF, Jens continues to explore the themes of seduction and star-crossed love. The offer of a payment of hush money, which is also supposed to cover either the cost of the sexual encounter or the future care of the child, is reminiscent of the ballad of the seductive, yet suicidal, count (BJK 1.04). It is likely that the annotation above to "forty weeks" is in reference to this ballad (BJK 1.03).</annotation>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen publishes this ballad in Jyske Folkeminder XI under the rubric "Barselkvinden" [The birth woman], cataloging this fragment as variant C. He interpolates the second line. The other two variants under that rubric refer to witchcraft. In the first, a woman is forced to carry her children for eight years before giving birth to twins. In the second, a witch reveals her curse, and the people are able to counteract it, allowing the witch's stepdaughter to give birth.

      It is possible that this fragment belongs to the previous ballad, although the length of the measure, and the strong line separating the records in the manuscript mitigate against such an interpretation. It may however be related to the next ballad Jens performs, the well-known ballad of "Redselille og Medelvold" (DgF 271), although this verse is not attested in any other variants (AMJ 1.01). Most likely, it is a fragment of another ballad that Jens could not remember.

     The reference to "forty weeks" (BJK 1.03) may also be in reference to this short fragment. More likely, the previous ballad reminded Jens of this short verse, but he was unable to remember the rest of the ballad.</annotation>

    <annotation>"Redselille og Medelvold" is one of the most attested ballads in Danish tradition, with Grundtvig mentioning well over fifty recorded variants (DgF V, 234). Jens' variant appears in Dal and Pi&#xF8;'s addendum to DgF as 271P*. By the time the supplement was published (1965), another fifty or so variants had been recorded. 

     Among those who knew and sung ballads, it would have been unusual if they did not know this one (AMJ 1.01). Although the general plot outline is stable across the many variants, there is a great deal of variation in the details--so much so that most variants do not have more than one or two attestations (except for variant V, which has 25 attestations). 

     The ballad is not very old, with the earliest attestation in Denmark is in a broadside from 1770 (DgF V, 234). First attestations in Sweden (1776) and Norway (1813) are even later (DgF V, 235). 

     The themes of the ballad resonate well with many of the other ballads Jens knew--forbidden love, wrath of the parents, fear of childbirth, and tragic death.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Rosenillen dances on the floor with vigor
so the milk sprang from her breast
-Haahaahaaha!
so the milk sprang from her breast.

&#x201C;And listen, Rosenillen, dear daughter mine!
why does milk spring from your breasts?&#x201D;

&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t milk, even though it looks it,
it is the wine we drank yesterday.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Yes, milk is white and wine is red,
the two are unlike each other.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Dear mother, I cannot hide from you,
the young Mr. Nilwe has seduced me.&#x201D;

I&#x2019;ll have him hung from a branch,
and you yourself shall be sunk in a violent current.

I will have him fried and burned
and send you far off to distant lands.

My mother will have you fried and burned
and me she&#x2019;ll send to far off distant lands.

My mother will have you hung from a branch,
and me myself she&#x2019;ll sink in a violent current.&#x201D;

Now gather all the red gold in a chest,
while I saddle my gray mare.

Now when they got into Rosenslund,
there Rosenellen wanted to rest a while.

She couldn&#x2019;t call for a midwife

Before a man shall learn of a woman&#x2019;s sufferings,
I would rather first die out here in Rosenslund.

Then she lay out her cape so blue,
and she gave birth to two living sons on it.

Through Rosenslund there runs a stream,
Christ would I like a drink from that!&#x201D;

Mr. Nilwe was so true to Rosenille,
that he got her water in his silver-buckled shoes.

He gave her water as he had no wine,
and therefore he lost his most beloved.

Then he dug a grave

He lay Rosenille out in the grave with comfort,
he lay the two living ones up to her breast.

He rode so far out into the woods,
he heard that the two living ones cry under the cover.

Then he placed his spear against a rock,
so that the point did great injury to his heart.

He had to put a blindfold on his eyes, and then he was going to be her midwife.</english_manuscript>

16.  "Gjennem Rosenslund der rinder en Str&#xF8;m,

17.  Hr. Nilwe han var Rosenillen saa tro,
han hent' hender Vand i sin s&#xF8;lvsp&#xE6;nder Sko.

18. Han gav hender Vand, for han havde ej Vin, 
derfor maatt' han mist' Allerkj&#xE6;resten sin.

19.  [Han graved' en Grav saa vid og saa bred,

[it was now time for her to deliver]
He had to tie a blindfold over his eyes, and then he would be her midwife himself.

&#x201C;Before a man shall learn of a woman&#x2019;s sufferings,
I would rather first die out here in Rosenslund.&#x201D;

Then he lay out his cape so blue,
and she gave birth to two living sons on it.

&#x201C;Through Rosenslund there runs a stream,
Christ would I like a drink from that!&#x201D;

Mr. Nilwe was so true to Rosenille,
that he got her water in his silver-buckled shoes.

He gave her water as he had no wine,
and therefore he lost his most beloved.

[He dug a grave so wide and so broad,
and then he lay Rosenille and the children in it]

He lay Rosenille out in the grave with comfort,
he lay the two living ones up to her breast.

He rode so far out into the woods,
he heard that the two living ones cry under the cover.

Then he placed his spear against a rock,
so that the point did great injury to his heart.
-Haahaahaaha!
so that the point did great injury to his heart.</english_publication>

    <annotation>In Et hundrede gamle Danske skj&#xE6;mteviser, Jens's verse is relegated to the apparatus of the three main variants of "Den slemme kj&#xE6;lling" [The bad hag]. In variant A, to which Jens's verse alludes, a young man is initiated into sex by an old hag. When he tries to rid himself of her by approaching the bishop, she reveals herself to be a shape shifter, ultimately turning into a werewolf whose private parts are torn out by a fence pole. In variant B, a young man marries a hag who turns out to be a witch, a surmise made explicit in a verse sung by a child at Lime school (DSkv 4). Ultimately, the young man runs an old rusty knife up into her behind, loosing a torrent of devils. In variant C, a farmhand has an affair with what he thinks is a young girl, but she turns out to be a hag--in this case, a mound woman, recognizable by her oven rake and peel-board. 

      It is not hard to imagine that Jens is playing somewhat with the earnest folklore collector. While he takes his ballad singing quite seriously, he also has a broad repertoire that includes obscene and amusing songs. Not surprisingly, the fragment does not appear in DgF, although Grundtvig proposes certain similarities between the ballad and DgF 115, "Dansk Kongetal" [Danish Kings]. The main similarity concerns the hag of whom one cannot rid oneself.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens continues to sing bawdy songs, this one an exploration of marital infidelities. The ballad resonates well with various jocular tales that also tell of infidelities. Here, a man's cousin becomes his wife's lover. In the ballad, the husband vows revenge, intending to catch them in delecto flagrante, with the implication that he would kill Mikkel.

     An interesting formal feature of this ballad is that sung parts are interspersed with very short spoken parts. Tang Kristensen marks the spoken parts with parentheses. The final confrontation appears in broken German--Wast wast med de keine maken [sic.].

     In other genres, adultery appears both as the instigator of calamity, and also as the subject of great jocularity (as here). The tale type index includes a long series of types that revolve around adultery (ATU 1350-1360).</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens changes genres, and tells Tang Kristensen a widely attested legend of a woman acting as midwife to the mound dwellers (ML 5070). In Jens's story, the mound dweller's wife is a human, explaining why she needs a human midwife. In many variants where the woman giving birth is human, she turns out to have been kidnapped into the mound, usually as a young child (DS I 860; DS I 869). Here, the kidnapping has taken place in infancy, and she is identified as a changeling. The need for a human (read Christian) midwife is somewhat harder to explain, since the changeling was presumably never baptized, and therefore much more easily assimilated into the world of mound dwellers.

     The mound dweller's wife provides assistance to the midwife, providing her with a series of instructions to successfully escape the underground world. Unlike the fairytale, where such instructions (and prohibitions) would go unheeded, the midwife follows the instructions to the letter, and is richly rewarded.

     As in many of these stories, the gift of the mound dweller seems at first glance to be worthless. The differing value systems of the out group are made explicit in the type of payment; once the seemingly modest, or even useless, payment is accepted (and not discarded), it turns out to be quite substantial.

     The instruction to hold onto the door knocker is not widely attested, although it does occur in other variants (DS I 1122). The door, or the door knocker, must be linked to the liminality of the physical threshold/door that literally separates the inside from the outside. Tang Kristensen initially writes "Tronbusk" for the hawthorn bush the woman is to hold onto, transposing the "r" and the "o" and forgetting to include an "e"; he corrects this at the next mention of the bush. Although hawthorn is used in various folk remedies, here the requirement that she hold the hawthorn bush is more related to unlikely actions, because hawthorn bushes are covered by spines; deliberately holding onto a hawthorn is not normal, thus picking up on the liminal--and dangerous--nature of this interaction.</annotation>

The mound dweller man came one evening and greeted her from his wife and asked her if she'd follow him to help out with those affairs. They used this old Else H. a lot for that, because back then there weren't any trained midwives. Yes, it would be a shame to deny her that, but she wanted to know where the mound dweller's wife was from. She was from &#xD8;rnbj&#xE6;rg, he said, but some new people had come there, and she didn't know them, he said. Was he from &#xD8;rnbj&#xE6;rg? Yes, he was. But how are we going to find our way out there, it was so dark? Yes, they could certainly do that, he said. He'd told them that they could put candles in the windows, and that was good enough. They'd go towards them. Just as they were walking along, they fell down into the earth, and they came down to where the mound man's wife was lying. Else helped the woman deliver and that went well, but then the man went out. Then she says to the woman: Sure, I've come down here, but how am I going to get back? Well, it would work out, the mound dweller woman was also a changeling. Else shouldn't worry about it, she said. He'll accompany you home, but you should turn one of your mittens around, I can't remember if it was the right or the left, but either one was equally strong, and then he'll pay you, you should pick up your apron and hold what he'll give you in that, and then he'll dance with you three times around a hawthorn bush, she said, and you can grab onto it with your hand when you're done dancing; then you'll be holding onto your door knocker, she said. When he says goodbye, turn the glove around, otherwise he'll take you back down. Well, then he went off with her when they were done and then he danced with her around the thorn bush and gave her lots of big flint stones in her apron, and she held it up and and then she took hold of the knocker of her door. When he'd said good night to her he couldn't take her back with him. Then she went inside and tossed the flint stones down in front of the wood stove and then she went to bed. When she woke up in the morning the flint stones had turned into the most beautiful silver coins.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>This annotation appears to be notes Tang Kristensen made as a means for keeping track of Jens's stories and songs. He probably used the note as a shorthand so as not to forget which stories Jens had told. If this is the case, then the annotation would refer to BJK 1.13 (Lindorm); BJK 1.15 (the rune stone); BJK 1.22 (ballad about the minister and the craftsmen); and BJK 1.23 (Old Villads).  

     The annotation reveals aspects of Tang Kristensen's collecting technique, at least in the earlier part of his career. Jens told a series of stories, and then Tang Kristensen asked him to retell them at a slower pace so that he could write them down. Later in his career, Tang Kristensen changed his methods as he became more adept at quicker transcription, and no longer needed to rely as much on repetition.</annotation>

    <annotation>Despite the fact that the revenant in this story has been conjured down, Jens's mother is afraid that the ghost is still haunting when she sees the sparks up ahead. The threat of revenants breaking the bonds of being conjured are a constant threat in Danish legend tradition. Amusingly, it is the parish clerk, presumably the voice of reason and rationality given his role as school teacher, who is making the sparks because he too is afraid of walking the road alone. 

     Tang Kristensen makes some significant additions in the published version, changing the order of events, and expanding on the thoughts and statements of Jens's mother.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was supposed to be someone conjured down in S&#xF8;rvad. My mother was walking from Torstedlund late one night and she saw someone walking in front of her making sparks the whole time. It was the parish clerk from &#xC5;restrup, Niels Krafsen. &#x201C;You almost scared me to death,&#x201D; he said &#x201C;Now you can wait a bit and we can accompany each other.&#x201D; No, she didn&#x2019;t want to wait there. When she&#x2019;d seen the glittering, she&#x2019;d thought, now he&#x2019;s coming. It was strange that someone like the parish clerk was also scared, and went making sparks, and it was a long way.</english_manuscript>

Hun gik jo og t&#xE6;nkte: "Nu kommer han (gjengangeren)", men da var det ikke andet end degnen i &#xC5;restrup, Niels Krafsen, som gik og slog ild med hans fyrt&#xF6;j hele tiden. "Du var snart ved at have r&#xE6;det mig hen", sagde han, "jeg troede, du var et gjenf&#xE6;rd, og derfor slog jeg ild. Nu kan du bie lidt, s&#xE5; kan vi f&#xF8;lges ad". Nej, hun vilde ikke bie p&#xE5; det sted, og s&#xE5; gik hun hendes vej.

    <english_publication>There was supposed to be someone conjured down in S&#xF8;rvad. Late one night, my mother was walking from Torstedlund and had to go by that place, and then she all of a sudden sees a strange glittering in front of her, and it continued for quite a while, until she finally got up to it. She went and thought, &#x201C;Now he&#x2019;s coming  (the revenant),&#x201D; but it wasn&#x2019;t anything but the parish clerk from &#xC5;restrup, Niels Krafsen, who was walking along making sparks with his flint lighter the whole time. &#x201C;You almost scared me to death,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;I thought you were a revenant, and that&#x2019;s why I kept making sparks. Now you can wait a bit and we can accompany each other.&#x201D; No, she didn&#x2019;t want to wait there, and so she went her way. It was strange that someone like the parish clerk was just as afraid of the revenant as my mother.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Pacts with the Devil usually end in calamity. Here, the manor lord recognizes the sign of impending peril--the blood red socks--and tries to develop a strategy to avoid the Devil. Unable to do so, he decides to take his money with him, by ingesting it. In other stories, "taking it with you" inevitably leads to haunting (JPP 1.08). Although the manor lord is unsuccessful in his rather pitiful attempt to eat the silver and generously gives the fortune to the hired girl, he apparently haunts the farm later (his haunting only appears in Tang Kristensen's emended published version).

     The Devil in this story appears as the well-dressed gentleman, a widely attested form throughout northern Europe (V&#xE4;lk 2001). His arrival in a fine carriage is also widely attested, mimicking the carriages of manor lords (PJ 2.01; 3.08).

     While cutting live wood in forests was forbidden without specific permission from the forest owner (usually a manor lord or the Crown), collecting fallen wood was generally permitted. That people would not touch a fallen oak is significant in this context, and speaks to the fear that was attached through narrative to touching that particular tree.

     Tang Kristensen makes some significant changes to the published story, adding detail that is not included in the manuscript. Most notable among these additions is the inclusion of a farmhand who confirms the haunting at the farm. Jens alludes to this haunting at the farm in a later, short unpublished narrative about Peder Yde and the place where Peder and the Devil crossed the stream (BJK 3.01). Several of the episodes--such as the girl's discovery of the manor lord's brain hanging on the walls of the room--are moved to later in the narrative.

     The story has an elaborate coda that could stand as an independent story. The response to the villagers' query about the passengers stands as an amusing indictment of the power elites and their corruption in rural Denmark.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man who lived in Teglg&#xE5;rden, a little manor farm between Buderup and Skj&#xF8;rping, and he'd given himself to the devil. The devil was supposed to give him a sign before he came and took him, so that he could be somewhat prepared for the trip. Then one Sunday morning, his hired girl was to go and get his clothes for him, he wanted to go to church. So she brings him a pair of white stockings, but they looked red to his eyes. He says to her that she should get him another pair, he didn't want those. She got him another pair, but they were red too, and all the ones she brought were red. Then he says that he doesn't want to go to church today and she should put them away. Then he chased all the people off to church, everyone of them was to go except for the girl, she was to stay home. She was to get him a big bowl of sour milk, he said to her, and he put a bunch of silver coins in it, he wanted to spoon the coins into himself. She was to give him a spoon, but he couldn't swallow them. So he pushed them over to the girl, she could have them. Immediately, the finest carriage drove into the courtyard and stopped in front of the main door. She thought that it was important guests arriving and he went in to see Peder Yde, that's what the man who was sitting in the wagon did. She didn't see what he did to him, but she did hear that he complained and he didn't have the chance to leave out the door with him, but rather had to leave through a corner window, and then off with him. When the girl went into the room she saw his brains hanging on the walls, he'd grabbed him pretty hard. They drove over an oak by Hv&#xE6;ldam, there were some scrub oak trees and other oaks down by the stream that runs between Skj&#xF8;rping and Teglg&#xE5;rden, some oaks at the time, and cleaved it so that it almost broke in two, and it hung down and grew like that for many years, and because the devil had driven over it there was no one who dared take it. When they drove north to Hell--no one saw a trace of him any more but they asked about him later when he went over the sea with him, who he was. Well, it was the devil. And what freight did he have? Well, he had Andreas the bishop and Andreas Fal and Peder Yd'. Where were they from? Well, one was the bishop of Bremen, and the other was a dean--I can't remember now where he was from, but it was a place way down south, and the third was the man from Teglg&#xE5;rden.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en mand, der boede i Teglg&#xE5;rden, en bitte herreg&#xE5;rd imellem Buderup og Skj&#xF6;rping, og han havde givet sig Fanden i vold. Men Fanden var g&#xE5;et ind p&#xE5; den akkord, at han nok skulde vise ham et tegn, f&#xF6;r han kom og tog ham, s&#xE5;dan at han kunde v&#xE6;re noget belavet p&#xE5; rejsen. S&#xE5; var det en s&#xF8;ndag morgen, hans pige skulde hen og hente hans s&#xF8;ndagskl&#xE6;der til ham, han vilde til kirke, og da hun nu f&#xF8;rst kommer med et par hvide hoser til ham, var de r&#xF8;de for hans &#xF6;jne. S&#xE5; siger han, at hun skulde hente ham et par andre, s&#xE5;dan nogle vilde han ikke have. Hun hentede et andet par, men de var ogs&#xE5; r&#xF8;de, og alle dem, hun kom med, de var r&#xF8;de. S&#xE5; bliver han helt kjed af det og siger, dede han vilde ikke til kirke i dag, hun skulde l&#xE6;gge dem v&#xE6;k igjen. Dern&#xE6;st gjente han alle folkene til kirken, de skulde af sted hver &#xE9;n s&#xE5; n&#xE6;r som den pige, der havde givet ham hoserne, hun skulde blive hjemme. Nu skulde hun hente ham et fadfulder sur m&#xE6;lk, sagde han til hende, og der kom han s&#xE5;dan en m&#xE6;ngde s&#xF8;lvpenge i. "Nu skal du tage mig en ske," sagde han, og s&#xE5; vilde han til at s&#xF8;be pengene i sig, men han kunde ikke s&#xF8;kke dem. S&#xE5; sk&#xF8;d han fadet hen til pigen, nu kunde hun tage dem. Straks efter kom den stadseste befordring ind i g&#xE5;rden og holdt uden for den store d&#xF6;r. Hun troede, det var store fremmede, de fik, og den mand, der sad i vognen, kom ogs&#xE5; ind til herren, men hvad han gjorde ved ham, det s&#xE5; hun ikke, hun h&#xF8;rte derimod nok, at han klagede sig, og han havde heller ikke stunder at g&#xE5; ud af d&#xF6;ren med ham, men ud af en karm vinduer, og s&#xE5; af sted med ham, og det gik i en fart, for da de kom til den b&#xE6;k, der er mellem Skj&#xF6;rping og Teglg&#xE5;rden, da kj&#xF8;rte de &#xE6;p&#xE5; en eg ved Hv&#xE6;ldam, der stod jo s&#xE5;dan noget egepurkler og egev&#xE6;rkeri den gang ved den b&#xE6;k, og gr&#xF8;ttede den, s&#xE5; den kom halvt af og h&#xE6;ngte s&#xE5;dan og groede i mange &#xE5;r, og for det Fanden havde kj&#xF8;rt p&#xE5; den, var der vel ingen, der turde tage den. Nu var der jo ingen, der s&#xE5; f&#xE6;rd til Per Yde videre &#x2014; ja for s&#xE5;dan hed herren p&#xE5; Teglg&#xE5;rden &#x2014; men de rejste jo nord p&#xE5; til Helvede med hverandre, og siden &#xE6;bag efter spurgte folk, at den gang Fanden rejste over havet med ham, da kom der et skib sejlende lige forbi i det samme, og folkene der r&#xE5;bte ham an, hvem han var. Ja, det var Djywlen. Hvad han havde til fragt? Ja, han havde Andreas bisp og Andreas Fal og Peder Yd'. Hvor de var fra? siger skibsfolkene. &#xC5;, den ene var bispen af Bremen, og den anden var en provst &#x2014; a kan nu ikke huske, hvor han var fra, men det var da et sted langt s&#xF8;nder &#xE6;p&#xE5;, og den tredje det var manden fra Teglg&#xE5;rden. Se, det var det sidste, folk h&#xF8;rte til Peder Yde, men den gang pigen kom ind i v&#xE6;relset, hvor Fanden havde taget ham ud fra, da s&#xE5; hun hj&#xE6;rnen sidde &#xE5;p&#xE5; v&#xE6;ggene, s&#xE5; han m&#xE5; have taget noget h&#xE5;rdt ved ham.

Now no one saw Per Yde any more--you see that&#x2019;s what the manor lord at Teglg&#xE5;rden was called--but they traveled north to hell with each other, and after that people heard that when the devil traveled over the sea with him, a ship came sailing right by at the same moment and the people called out asking who he was. Well, it was the devil. And what freight did he have? Well, he had Andreas the bishop and Andreas Fal and Peder Yde. Where were they from?, ask the shipspeople. Well, one was the bishop of Bremen, and the other was a dean--I can&#x2019;t remember now where he was from, but it was a place way down south--and the third was the man from Teglg&#xE5;rden. You see, that was the last people heard of Peder Yde, but when the girl came into the room where the devil had taken him, she saw his brains hanging on the walls, so he must have grabbed him pretty hard. There was a farmhand who worked here in the town who said that there was always a ruckus in the attic at Teglg&#xE5;rden at night.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens makes an interesting connection between old land use patterns and newly emerging land use patterns. The reference to the rune stone found in the newly apportioned field at once emphasizes the responsibility of the individual, rather than the collective (jordf&#xE6;llesskab), to care for the fields. At the same time, the discovery of the rune stone alludes to the long history of the earlier organization of the fields. The rune stone is plowed back into the field, and the historical connection between the past and the future is lost--one can no longer find the connection to the past in the current organization of the fields.

     The stone described here must be absolutely massive, since four horses cannot pull it. Such a massive size is out of line with most rune stones that were of more modest proportions. The description of the runes is odd, since runes were carved into the stone, and would appear as depressions. Runes would not look as if they had been glued on to the stone. 

     Rune stones were less of a common find in Danish fields than they were in Swedish fields (Moltke 1976 and 1985). In Sweden, many stones were blown up by farmers intent on clearing their fields of what they considered to be nuisances. Nevertheless, there are numerous documented instances of farmers discovering rune stones and other earlier archaeological treasures while plowing. Perhaps the best known rune stones in Denmark are the two stones in the churchyard at Jelling, known as the elder and younger Jelling stones, the smaller of which was used as a bench outside of the church until 1627.     

     Runes and the inscription of runes have often been attributed magical power. Rune stones themselves often refer to these powers. This story, however, makes no mention of any such magical connection. The surmise that the rune stone had stood on top of the mound is possible, although not likely, as most rune stones were placed near roads. 

     There are significant differences between the published version and the manuscript version. Tang Kristensen changed the source of the story from Jens's maternal aunt to his mother, and moved several other references to the timing of the story to the front of the narrative. Jens mentioned the events in a later session with Tang Kristensen in a far less detailed story (BJK 4.24). In that short narrative, Jens mentioned that the motivation for digging up the stone was to use the large rock as building material, a surprisingly common fate for many such stones.</annotation>

He had four good horses, and really wanted to bring it back to the farm, but then he decided that it was too big to carry it off from there. When the farmhand had gotten it dug out, there were all sorts of raised letters on it, they weren&#x2019;t carved into it, more like they&#x2019;d been glued onto it. My mother wasn&#x2019;t more than a little girl back then, she was born in 1792. It was after they&#x2019;d reapportioned the fields. There was some heather near Bavnh&#xF8;j at that time. Then they had to dig a hole below it that was big enough for them to push it in, shove it down into. It turned out there was some beautiful white sand that was easy to dig. It had to be so deep that they could plow over it. It was probably a stone that had stood over on Bavnh&#xF8;j in the old days. The fields have been completely changed around since that time.

It was after the fields had been reapportioned and her father plowed into it. Then he got his farmhand out there to help him dig a ditch around it, but it was so big that four horses couldn&#x2019;t pull it up, and he had four good horses too, and really wanted to bring it back to the farm, it could have closed up a big part of the stone wall around the farm. But when he realizes that it's too big to freight off, they decide to bury it. Then they had to dig a hole below it that was big enough for them to push it in, and it had to be deep enough that they could plow over it; that wasn&#x2019;t too hard because it turned out there was some beautiful white sand there that was easy to dig. There was some heather near Bavnh&#xF8;j at that time, and it was starting to break up when my father ran into it.

    <annotation>The kj&#xE6;mpekast or j&#xE6;ttekast [giant throw] is a widely attested legend motif (DS III 128). In almost all cases, the giant tries to knock over the local church steeple, perhaps because the ringing of the bells disturbs him, perhaps because the encroachment of Christianity, as marked by the church building, threatens his territory. Although the giant's throw most often comes up short, here he overthrows. These stories are considered to be "etiological" as they explain the existence of an unusually large stone in the landscape, often marked by the giant's hand. 

     Denmark is a deeply glaciated landscape. Retreating glaciers from the last ice age littered the fertile soil with enormous rocks, known as glacial erratics. These erratics exhibit both striation, revealing the direction of the glacier's movement, and other types of fragmentation, that can lead to unusual patterns on their surface. Although originally buried in the silt and soil left by the glacier, these rocks are uncovered through normal processes of erosion.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens relates a masterfully crafted story about murder, greed, stupidity and cruelty. The first part is similar to stories classified as ATU 1359, Husband Outwits Adulteress and Lover, although in the manuscript version, the wife colludes with the husband. The Jewish peddler is simply led to believe that he is going to sleep with the farmer's wife. 

     The wandering merchant or peddler is well known in Danish tradition, and appears in both legend and folktales. Many of these peddlers are identified as Jewish peddlers (J&#xF8;de kr&#xE6;mmer). While the population of Jews in Denmark was never very large, many Jews in Denmark made their living in trade, both large and small scale. The history of Jews in Denmark is fairly complex, and laws pertaining to Jews often distinguished between Sephardic Jews and Ashkenazi Jews, the former receiving better treatment under the law. The first ordinance governing Jews in Denmark was promulgated February 2, 1651, by King Frederik III, in part deporting all Jews who had immigrated illegally. 

     Jens's story is similar to Peder Johansen's story of the farms at Heaven and Hell (PJ 1.02), particularly in the later episode where the jealous, wealthy neighbor believes their poor neighbor has been measuring money with a grain scoop. The fatal advice that the poor farmers give their neighbor is perhaps even more sadistic--and certainly more obscene--than the corresponding episode in Peder Johansen's story.

     Jens reveals a great mastery of storytelling in this account, blending aspects of the humorous jocular tale, with the more believable legend and the utterly fictional folktale. References to place names, named individuals, and technology--such as the type of plow the poor sister used--play on the concept of believability, while the episode of self-mutilation and the minister relies on an absurd suspension of disbelief. The hat made from the woman's genitalia, and the man's subsequent strangulation, move the story firmly into the realm of the burlesque. The absurd final reference at the end to a series of subsequent owners of the ropes made from the hat can only be seen as Jens's own amusing meta-narrative commentary on performance.

      Tang Kristensen plays rather fast and loose with the manuscript version of this story, separating it into two different accounts, the first part published as JAH V 505, and the second part remaining unpublished. JAH V 505 follows the fair copy of the story, indexed as &#xC6;v. 1247, J&#xF8;dekr&#xE6;mmeren, until the wandering merchant is chased down to Gravlev. Tang Kristensen publishes a modified version of the second part of the story as JAH I 212 (BJK 1.20), adding the opening line "as a satire about the previously used tool." Interestingly, that line refers to a story told by Kristen Kristensen Smed (JA H I 211), and not a story told by Jens. Indeed, Jens makes no other mention of leather straps or ropes in his storytelling.

     In the published version of the first part of this story, Tang Kristensen adds the short sentence about the merchant losing all his possessions. To make matters more absurd, he also adds a long note after the published version of this story concerning both the injustices directed at wandering merchants and the dubious nature of many of these same merchants. Although the note encapsulates much of the debate over rural poverty and the status of wandering mendicants, particularly the kr&#xE6;mmere but, by extension, the rakkere and natmandsfolk, it is utterly misplaced: "When we hear about all the injustice and violence that have been directed at these wandering merchants, we cannot be entirely silent concerning these people's crass behavior. A large number of other fairytales and jocular legends indicate that it was not rare nor even uncommon for things to go as described above, and these descriptions seem to be in many ways taken directly from lived experiences. The merchants should not be considered as totally innocent victims, and many of them have at the very least lived a loose life. When I was a young man, a merchant managed in a quite tricky manner to get me to hide some wares for him. I had no idea there was something suspicious about this and didn't suffer any consequences, but he naturally enjoyed taking advantage of my trust and my sympathy for his difficult lot." The note, however profoundly felt, is disingenuous, given Tang Kristensen's overt manipulation of his source. It is possible that he wanted to cover his tracks, and added this unusual editorial, to further deflect attention from his manipulation. The story Jens tells is not about the poor lot of the wandering merchants, but rather a humorous and obscene tale about sibling rivalry gone amok.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There were two sisters who lived here in Oplev, one was rich and the other was poor. They lived in Jens Markussen&#x2019;s and Anders Jensen&#x2019;s farm, the two southern farms. The poor one was a such a pretty young woman, and the other one was a little bit older. They had nobody to drive the plow other than a little girl, when they plowed, at that time they used the old wheel plows with four in front. When they weren&#x2019;t plowing, they didn&#x2019;t have anyone there. When they were going to harrow, the wife had to harrow with the nags herself and when they were utterly exhausted, she would have to go home and feed the livestock. So one day this Jewish wandering merchant comes to the poor sister when she&#x2019;d just come back from the fields and he showed her his wares and wanted to do business with her. She said that she wasn&#x2019;t going to buy anything since she didn&#x2019;t have any money. But he said that she should look around in the old chest with the iron bands that stood in there, she&#x2019;d probably find some money there. No, she knew that there wasn&#x2019;t any, it wouldn&#x2019;t do any good. Well, he showed her one nice piece of clothing after another, as traveling merchants are wont to do. Yes, she really was interested in them, but that didn&#x2019;t really help matters, since she didn&#x2019;t have anything to pay for them with. Wouldn&#x2019;t get any. Then he gets her to try something on: here&#x2019;s a piece of clothing that he&#x2019;d give to her, if he could lie with her for a little while. These Jews often wanted to do that. She didn&#x2019;t dare do that, she said, because when her husband saw it, he&#x2019;d want to know where she&#x2019;d gotten it from, since he knew that she didn&#x2019;t have any money. Then he takes his wallet up with all these silver coins in it and tosses a shilling to her, she could have it and her husband wouldn&#x2019;t need to know. When the woman saw that he had all these silver coins she looked at the sun and said, &#x201C;No, it's noon now and my husband will come home. But I have another idea. Tonight he&#x2019;s going to the mill to get grain for the nags. You should come then and ask for lodgings for the night, then we&#x2019;ll work it out.&#x201D; He thought this was a great idea. She talks to her husband about this and said that he had all this money, and that it would be good to get a hold of the money since it was tight for them. She&#x2019;d convinced him. Now you should stand out in the entry and greet him, and she&#x2019;d listen to their conversation. Well, then the wandering merchant came and wanted lodgings for the night there, it looked like they could. No, their apartment wasn&#x2019;t large enough to offer people lodgings. Sure, they had enough room, he knew the place well. But they didn&#x2019;t have anything to put on the bed, no he&#x2019;d better go to the inn &#x2013; there was an inn in Gravlev at that time. No, he had to head west the next morning. Well, then the husband finally let the wife take care of it. She was also hard to convince, but he was finally given permission. Then the husband puts on his long jacket, puts a sack under his arm and grabs a staff and asks his wife to feed the nags one more time, and then she was going to make an evening snack for the wandering merchant. After she&#x2019;d fed the merchant, they were going to go to bed. That was the most important thing. The her husband comes running in through the kitchen door with a club. The wife had been careful to tell the merchant he could put his goods in that old chest and she gave him the key, and then they went to bed. Now the husband starts beating the poor merchant. The wife she wailed that he shouldn&#x2019;t beat him like that. He was going to kill them both. She manages to start fighting with him and the merchant grabs his clothes and runs out the door, which her husband had opened. Her husband runs after him and chases him down to the little woods in Gravlev. So the next morning, they were going to open the chest and look through the merchant&#x2019;s wares, and they find a purse filled with silver coins. We can&#x2019;t count them, said the wife, but I&#x2019;ll go over to my sister and borrow her quarter measure, I think there&#x2019;s a whole quarter measure, we can measure the money there. What do you want it for? You don&#x2019;t have anything to measure. I want to measure my money. Have you gotten a hold of so many of them. So she gets it and goes home. Something glistens. It is a tiny little shilling from L&#xFC;bek, and was so careless that some of them got stuck between the tangs. The sister is curious and finds the money. I have them, there is money. Where did you get them from? I&#x2019;ll tell you how it is. I had my husband cut my thingy out and had the girl bring it up to the minister and I got a whole quarter measure of money for it. That was quite a good price, do you think he&#x2019;d buy more? Yes, she figured he would. Well, she didn&#x2019;t really need any money, but she wanted more, and so hers too. Got her husband to take his straight-razor and sent the hired girl off with it on a white plate with a little napkin over it and up to the minister. Does he buy pussies? What did you say? Says it again. Let me see. The Devil take me, people are becoming completely stupid, they take my cows and leave me the mule. The hired girl gets so scared hearing the minister swear like that that she runs home and by that time the woman was dead. Then her husband felt that you couldn&#x2019;t just throw something like that away, and he figured he could make a nice cap out of it. They used to wear fox caps at the time. So he wore it to church one day and on the way home there was quite a rain storm, and it got so big that it plopped down around his neck. The hired girl had really heated up the house and so he sat down to warm himself up and as it dried out it shrunk around his neck and strangled him.  Then they had to cut it off of his neck and then they tossed it out onto the dung heap. Another man came to the farm, and it was their habit that they&#x2019;d drive dung out in the spring and he finds this thing in the dung heap. He figures he could make a set of reigns out of it &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what they said back then, they used leather ropes, they were made just like hemp ropes are nowadays, and they used those as far back as I can remember, and when they&#x2019;d driven them to pieces and they could use them as plow guides, they had yokes or harnesses and pillows on the horses. And so he has four of these ropes made, and drives off to Nibe to get a load of herring, as was the custom in those days when he&#x2019;d planted. And so it gets on toward night and he&#x2019;s had several big drinks down there and it was night before he came back from the town. So when he was driving and got to Uslev, there&#x2019;s a big hill south of the town that he had to go up, he got down off the wagon and walked alongside it. It started to rain really hard. After he&#x2019;d gotten a ways, he decided to get back up and drive again, but the wagon was gone and he couldn&#x2019;t see anything on the horses except these pillows and the empty harness and it was raining and it was really dark. He had no idea what to do, so he got up on the left side horse and rode home. When he gets home, he takes the pillows and harnesses off the horses, and hung them on these large wooden hooks on the north side of the barn, that&#x2019;s where they hung their equipment (tack) when they came home from the fields in the spring, and he goes in and tells his wife what had happened, and that he&#x2019;d have to go and get the wagon, but it would have to wait until morning, since the weather was so bad. Then around dawn, it became really windy and dry, and as the ropes dried the wagon came rolling in. By the time it was 10 in the morning, his wagon and herring were home, they came right into the farmyard to him. He used those ropes as long as he was the master of the farm and his son Jens N&#xF8;rgaard after him. His name was Ellavst, the man who&#x2019;d had the ropes made. They say after his mother. He had a son El Jens. When Peder Tygesen became the master there he had enough to use for tying his thresher.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der boede to s&#xF8;stre her i Oplev, den ene var rig, og den anden fattig. De boede i Jens Markussens og Anders Jensens g&#xE5;rd, de to s&#xF8;ndre g&#xE5;rde. Den rige var den &#xE6;ldste, og den fattige var s&#xE5;dan en kj&#xF6;n ung kone. De havde ingen folk uden en t&#xF8;s til at kj&#xF8;re ploven, n&#xE5;r de plovede, for den gang brugte de jo de gamle hjulplove med fire for. N&#xE5;r der skulde harves, m&#xE5;tte konen selv ud med krikkerne, for de havde ikke pigen til hj&#xE6;lp, uden n&#xE5;r de plovede. N&#xE5;r de s&#xE5; var tr&#xE6;tte til hobe, skulde konen hjem at give h&#xF8;vederne. S&#xE5; kom der en j&#xF8;dekr&#xE6;mmer en dag ind til den fattige s&#xF8;ster, da hun var kommen hjem af marken, og han viser jo hans kram an og vil handle med hende. Hun sagde nej, hun skulde ikke handle, for hun havde ingen penge. Men han sagde, at hun skulde lede omkring i den gamle j&#xE6;rnbundne kiste, der stod der inde, s&#xE5; fandt hun nok nogle. Nej, der var ingen, det vidste hun nok. N&#xE5;, han viste hende jo &#xE9;t p&#xE6;nt kl&#xE6;de efter et andet, som kr&#xE6;mmerne plejer. Ja, hun havde lyst nok til dem, men det kunde nu ikke hj&#xE6;lpe.

Deher j&#xF8;dekr&#xE6;mmere havde jo og lyst til det. Det turde hun ikke, for n&#xE5;r manden fik at se, hun havde det kl&#xE6;de, s&#xE5; vilde han have at vide, hvor det var kommet fra, han vidste jo, hun havde ingen penge. S&#xE5; tager han hans pung op med s&#xE5; mange s&#xF8;lvpenge i og flyer hende en skilling, den m&#xE5;tte hun have, s&#xE5; manden vidste det ikke. Da konen s&#xE5;, at kr&#xE6;mmeren havde de mange s&#xF8;lvpenge, sa hun til solen og sagde: "Nej, det er nu middag, og s&#xE5; kommer manden hjem. Men a v&#xE9;d et andet r&#xE5;d, i aften skal han til m&#xF8;lle og hente korn til krikkerne, s&#xE5; skal du komme og forlange kvarter, s&#xE5; kan det nok g&#xE5;". Det forslag tykte han godt nok om. Hun snakker med manden om det og forestiller ham, at det var godt at f&#xE5; fat i de penge. "Nu skal du st&#xE5; ude i frammerset og tage imod ham, og s&#xE5; skal du gj&#xF8;re dig f&#xE6;rdig, som om du vil til m&#xF8;lle". N&#xE5;, s&#xE5; kom kr&#xE6;mmeren og vilde have kvarter der. Nej, det var deres lejlighed ikke til at have s&#xE5;danne folk i kvarter, siger manden. Ja, de havde plads nok, han var godt tjent med det. Men de havde heller ikke noget at l&#xE6;gge p&#xE5; sengen, nej, han fik at g&#xE5; til kroeret &#x2014; der var kro i Gravlev den gang. Nej, det kunde han ikke, for han skulde vester p&#xE5; n&#xE6;ste morgen. Ja, s&#xE5; overlod manden det til sidst til konen. Hun var ogs&#xE5; str&#xE6;ng at komme af sted med, men omsider fik han lov. S&#xE5; tr&#xE6;kker manden i hans lange tr&#xF6;je, f&#xE5;r en s&#xE6;k under armen og kj&#xE6;p i h&#xE5;nden og beder konen om at give krikkerne en gang, og s&#xE5; skulde hun jo lave noget n&#xE6;tter til kr&#xE6;mmeren. Men det tog tid, og manden kom hjem, inden de var helt f&#xE6;rdige. Kr&#xE6;mmeren var endda kommen i seng, og nu klistrer manden p&#xE5; den arme kr&#xE6;mmer. Konen hun hv&#xE6;lld, at han m&#xE5;tte ikke sl&#xE5; ham s&#xE5;dan. Jo, han havde st&#xE5;et uden for og h&#xF8;rt, hvad han havde snakket med hans kone om, og nu skulde de sl&#xE5;es ihjel begge to. Hun f&#xE5;r da mon til at f&#xE5; i kj&#xE6;p med ham, og kr&#xE6;mmeren f&#xE5;r hans kl&#xE6;der under armen og ud ad d&#xF6;ren, som manden havde sl&#xE5;et op. Men manden bag efter ham og jager ham ned i krattet ved Gravlev. S&#xE5; slap han med livet, men hans penge havde han mist og hans kramkiste med, det turde han ikke hente siden.
     ETK: N&#xE5;r vi h&#xF8;rer om al den uret og alle de voldshandlinger, der er blevet &#xF8;vede imod de omvandrende kr&#xE6;mmere, m&#xE5; vi ej heller v&#xE6;re aldeles tavse med hensyn til selve disses r&#xE5; f&#xE6;rd. Ti at den undertiden og endda vel ej sj&#xE6;lden har v&#xE6;ret som oven for skildret, tyder en stor del andre skj&#xE6;mtende fort&#xE6;llinger og &#xE6;ventyr p&#xE5;, og de synes at v&#xE6;re i mange tr&#xE6;k som grebne lige ud af livet. Kr&#xE6;mmerne skal da ej st&#xE5; som helt br&#xF8;defri v&#xE6;sener, og et l&#xF8;st liv har mange af dem i alt fald f&#xF8;rt. Da jeg var et ungt menneske, fik en krammer mig p&#xE5; en ret snedig m&#xE5;de til at hj&#xE6;lpe sig at gjemme noget kram. Jeg anede ikke, at der var noget misligt derved og kom da heller ingen ulempe i, men han har naturligvis gottet sig over min godtroenhed og medynk med hans vanskelige f&#xE6;rd.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There were two sisters who lived here in Oplev, one was rich and the other was poor. They lived in Jens Markussen&#x2019;s and Anders Jensen&#x2019;s farms, the two southern farms. The rich one was the oldest and the poor one was a such a pretty young woman. When the poor sister plowed, they had nobody to drive the plow other than a little girl, since at that time they used the old wheel plows with four in front. When they were going to harrow, the wife had to go herself with the nags, since they didn&#x2019;t have a girl there except when they plowed. When they were utterly exhausted, she would have to go home and feed the cattle. This Jewish wandering merchant came one day to the poor sister when she&#x2019;d come back from the fields and he showed her his wares and wanted to do business with her. She said that she wasn&#x2019;t going to buy anything since she didn&#x2019;t have any money. But he said that she should look around in the old chest with the iron bands that stood in there, she would probably find some money there. No, she knew that there wasn&#x2019;t any. Well, he showed her one nice piece of clothing after another, as traveling merchants are wont to do. Yes, she really wanted them, but that didn&#x2019;t really help matters. Then he gets her to try something on: here&#x2019;s a piece of clothing that he&#x2019;d give to her, if he could lie with her for a little while. These Jewish wandering merchants liked to do that too. She didn&#x2019;t dare do that, because when her husband saw that she had the clothing, then he&#x2019;d want to know where she&#x2019;d gotten it from, since he knew that she didn&#x2019;t have any money. Then he takes his wallet up with all these silver coins in it and tosses a shilling to her, she could have it and her husband wouldn&#x2019;t need to know. When the woman saw that he had so many silver coins she looked at the sun and said, &#x201C;No, it's noon now and my husband will come home. But I have another idea. Tonight he is going to the mill to get grain for the nags, then you should come and ask for shelter, and it will probably work out.&#x201D; He liked this suggestion. She talks to her husband about this and tells him that it would be good to get a hold of the money. &#x201C;Now you should stand out in the entry and greet him, and then you should get ready like you were going to the mill.&#x201D; Well, then the wandering merchant came and wanted shelter there. No, their apartment wasn&#x2019;t large enough to give people shelter there. Sure, they had enough room, he knew the place well. But they didn&#x2019;t have anything to put on the bed, no he&#x2019;d better go to the inn &#x2013; there was an inn in Gravlev at that time. No, he couldn&#x2019;t do that, because he had to head west the next morning. Well, then the husband finally let the wife take care of it. She was also hard to convince, but he was finally given permission. Then the husband puts on his long jacket, puts a sack under his arm and grabs a staff and asks his wife to feed the nags one more time, and then she was going to make some evening snacks for the wandering merchant. But it took a while and they weren&#x2019;t done before the husband came home. The wandering merchant still had just gotten into bed, and now the husband grabs hold of the poor merchant. The wife wailed that he shouldn&#x2019;t beat him like that. Well, he&#x2019;d been standing outside and heard what he&#x2019;d talked about to his wife and now he was going to kill them both. She runs at him to fight with him and the merchant grabs his clothes and runs out the door, which the man had opened. The husband ran after him and chases him down to the little woods in Gravlev. So he escaped with his life, but he&#x2019;d lost his money and his box of wares too, and he didn&#x2019;t dare go back to get it.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The story that Tang Kristensen published about leather ropes eliminated an important feature of Jens's story, namely that these were no ordinary ropes, but rather ropes crafted from the vagina of a dead woman--hence their pliability (BJK 1.19). Tang Kristensen was loathe to publish stories that were obscene, and there was clearly no way that he would publish this story. The self-inflicted mutilation of the greedy neighbor is an integral component of Jens's story, and the account would make little sense if he simply jumped over it. Instead, Tang Kristensen decided to eliminate it, and split the story into two parts.

     Tang Kristensen had several other motivations for splitting these two parts of the story beyond the need to excise the obscene parts. By keeping the two stories together, he would have been forced to recognize the story as a fictional, humorous tale--it would neither fit into his conception of the legend, his conception of stories of daily life, nor his conception of the folktale. By breaking the stories apart, he found a reasonable solution that he felt no one would likely uncover. He could implicitly propose that the first part was a sad yet true commentary on the treatment and prejudice directed against wandering merchants--and as such an exploration of the tensions concerning the care for the poor that were an important issue in the politics of the time. The story would be classifiable as a legend, and quite at home in a section of Jyske Almueliv that was predominantly legends. 

The second part of the story, without the obscene episodes, would then stand as an amusing jocular tale about farm implements. It would allow Tang Kristensen to foreground the discussion of farming implements that used to be common on Danish farms (echoing the reference to the old plow that the woman was forced to use in the previous story). As such, the story would be at home in the first volume of Jyske Almueliv.</annotation>

    <danish_publication>Som satire p&#xE5; det forhen brugte redskab, kan her s&#xE6;ttes f&#xF8;lgende historie: Det f&#xF6;rste a kan huske, brugte de l&#xE6;derrebe, der var lagt ligesom hamperebe er nu, og n&#xE5;r de fik dem kj&#xF8;rt i stykker, s&#xE5; kunde de bruge dem til plejl&#xF8;le. De havde stavseltr&#xE6;er eller sejltr&#xE6;er p&#xE5; hestene. Det var den gang skik, n&#xE5;r de havde f&#xE5;et avlen i jorden, at de kj&#xF8;rte til Nibe at hente sig et l&#xE6;s sild. S&#xE5; var der en mand, han fik sig nogle store dramme der nede, og det blev aften, inden han kom fra byen. Den gang han kom s&#xE5; forbi Ugslev (Vogslev) kirke, s&#xE5; er der en stor bakke s&#xF8;nden for byen, som han skulde op ad, og der satte han sig af og gik ved siden af vognen. S&#xE5; gav det sig til at regne s&#xE5; st&#xE6;rkt. Da han nu var kommen et stykke hen, vilde han til at op at age igjen, men da var vognen v&#xE6;k, og han kunde ikke se andet p&#xE5; hestene end puderne og de bare sejltr&#xE6;er, for det regnede jo og var m&#xF8;rkt. Nu vidste han aldrig, hvad han skulde gjore, men s&#xE5; satte han sig da op at ride p&#xE5; den &#xE6;h&#xE5;nds hest og red s&#xE5; hjem ad. Han kommer s&#xE5; hjem, tager puderne og sejltr&#xE6;erne af hestene og h&#xE6;nger dem p&#xE5; nogle store tr&#xE6;kroge p&#xE5; nordsiden af laden, som de havde at h&#xE6;nge deres redskab p&#xE5;, n&#xE5;r de kom hjem af marken om for&#xE5;ret. Han g&#xE5;r nu ind og fort&#xE6;ller konen, hvordan han er kommen af sted, og han skulde jo hen og hente vognen, men nu fik det at v&#xE6;re til dag, da det var et vejr, s&#xE5; det var forf&#xE6;rdeligt. Men hen i dagningen blev det s&#xE5;dan et bl&#xE6;sende t&#xF6;rrevejr, og ligesom rebene de t&#xF6;rredes ind, s&#xE5; kom vognen, den var nemlig bleven st&#xE5;ende p&#xE5; vejen, og rebene havde givet sig forf&#xE6;rdelig i regnen. Den gang da klokken var ti, da havde han hans vogn og hans sild hjemme, den kom ind ad g&#xE5;rden til ham. Han brugte de l&#xE6;derrebe s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge han var mand, og han hed Ell-Lavst, vel sagtens efter hans moder. Hans son kaldte de Ell-Jens eller Jens N&#xF6;rg&#xE5;rd, og han fik dem bag efter ham. En stump af dem var endnu til, da Peder Tygesen blev mand, og han havde nok af dem at binde hans plejle med.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>As a satire about the previously used tool, there is the following story: The first thing I can remember is that they used leather ropes which were just like hemp rope is today, and when they had fallen to pieces, then they could be used with the corn thresher (plejl). They had stavseltr&#xE6;er or sejltr&#xE6;er [a wooden, lyre-shaped harness part] on the horses. It was the custom at the time, after they&#x2019;d planted, that they&#x2019;d drive to Nibe to get a load of herring. Then there was this guy who had a few large drams down there and it was the evening before he left town for home. Then when he came by Vogslev (Ugslev) church, there&#x2019;s a big hill there south of the town which he had to go up, and there he got down and walked beside the wagon. Then it started to rain hard. Since he&#x2019;d gotten a ways up the hill, he decided to get back up and drive, but the wagon had disappeared, and he couldn&#x2019;t see anything on the horses other than the blankets and the bare harness part, since it was raining and it was dark. Now he had no idea what he should do, but so then he got up to ride on one of the horses, and then he rode home. So he gets home and takes the blankets and the harness parts off the horses and hangs them up on some large wooden racks on the north side of the barn that they had there to hang their tools on when they came back from the fields in the spring. He goes inside and tells his wife what&#x2019;s happened, and that he&#x2019;d have to go and get the wagon, but now it&#x2019;d have to wait until the next day since the weather was so bad. But later in the day, the weather became dry and windy and, as the ropes dried up, the wagon came rolling in. The wagon had, in fact, remained on the road, and the ropes had simply stretched a great deal in the rain. When it was ten o&#x2019;clock, his wagon and herring were back at the farm, it came into the farmyard to him. He used those leather ropes as long as he was alive, and he was called Ell-Lavst, probably named for his mother. His son was called Ell-Jens or Jens N&#xF6;rg&#xE5;rd, and he inherited them. A stump of the ropes was still left when Peder Tygesen became a man, and he had enough with which to tie his thresher.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This fairytale is entitled "De tre Hunde" [The Three Dogs] in Brandt's (1974) index of Tang Kristensen's tales. Fairytales classified as ATU 300, "The Dragon-Slayer", are widely attested in Denmark and northern Europe. Thompson and Aarne note 129 variants of the tale in Danish collections. It is unlikely they counted this variant, as it was never published. It shares many features with a variant of ATU 303, The Twins or Blood-Brothers, told by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter (KMP 1.54).

     In the fair copy, Tang Kristensen expanded on the abbreviated notes that comprise the manuscript recording. In the manuscript, it appears that Jens forgot to tell the episode in the robbers den, prior to the boy's arrival in the capital at the moment wedding preparations were being made (Holbek's move 4), mentioning it instead at the end of the story (Holbek 1987). In the manuscript, Tang Kristensen crossed out the line, "The first night he slept" and then added the section about the robbers (Db 3246a).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>An old witch gave a boy three dogs: Burenbrak (Plower), St&#xE6;rkendreng (Strong Boy) and Sn&#xE6;rvind (Hardwind). Then he went off with them and they were so strong they could knock everything down. He wanted to go out and look about in the world. He went to the capital and there the royal castle was covered in black. He gets lodgings with a woman in the town. What does it mean... Yes, the king had been in trouble at sea three times, and he had promised his three daughters to three mermen in return for getting ashore. He has to give the first one tomorrow. Isn't there anyone who can save her? ... Ridder R&#xF8;d (The Red Knight), but she didn't know if he could. If he stayed until dinner then he'd get to see it... Then it came. The Red Knight came too with two loaded pistols up in a big tree. The boy goes out to her. She cries and tells him. Can no one save you ... The Red Knight is afraid and up in a tree. Hurry up ... couldn't he stay. Sure ... was going to die at some point anyway. Wanted to try. Smiled a little bit to him. Tied her ring in the long hair. Are you sitting here with mine? It was mine before it was yours, and it could be mine again too. They argued over it. To Burenbrak, take care of him. Knocked him out cold, grabbed onto his neck and bit his head off. Saved. He opened the mouth and took the tongue out. Go ... in no way. Yes, leaves. The Red Knight comes down, shoots her. Takes the head. The boy goes home to the old woman. The princess had sneaked off and told her sister that a boy with three dogs had saved her. The next merman. Second princess (?). The boy again ... Had a lot to cry about ... Will also take you ... He hasn't gotten you yet said the boy. Put her ring next to her sisters. The merman was whistling and roaring out in the ocean and had so much water around him that he almost took the princess and the boy with him. Sit there ... St&#xE6;rken Dreng. Couldn't do it alone. To Sn&#xE6;rvind, if both dogs and they tear him apart. She hung onto him, he was to stay... The boy goes away. The Red Knight cries tears. Closed wagon down to get them...three heads. The other two hadn't combed it anyway and saw her sisters' rings in his hair, and tied hers with them, and asked if he'd be friends. Then the merman came. The Red Knight almost fell into the water the merman brought with him... Got all three dogs. Fought a long time with him. Two heads off immediately, but the third was difficult...promise to marry him. The boy left, came again after a while. There were beautiful flags and things and finery everywhere. Then the boy says to Burenbrak, go get the bottle of wine that's in front of the bride and groom. The bride got so white under her eyes that she nearly fainted. The second to get bread from the table. The boy went off to see how they celebrated the wedding. Took the dogs with him. The two princesses went up and down the floor and whispered, and the Red Knight asked if they couldn't chase the dogs out. The king gets up. The boy asked if they had to leave, he thought they were welcome. He asks the Red Knight if he had gotten his wife honestly... Who has more right ... The Red Knight sentenced to death. The boy got the youngest. [The first night he slept.] When he traveled around he came into a big forest and was let into a lonely place and comes there, it was actually a robbers fort and there was no one home except for an old woman. He asked if he could have lodgings for the night, didn't want to have the dogs inside with him. There was a room, they could stay there until the next morning early, then he could take them. She brings some porridge and milk to him. Please eat it, a good portion because it would be the last thing he got. Yes, then he got that. Finished eating. Can't I take this whistle and amuse myself a little while. The old woman had given it to him, he could whistle them to him wherever he was. Yes, you can whistle as much as you want, but you'll never get your dogs again. Heated a pot of water, and threw it down on them, so she thought that they were dead, but when he blew into the whistle, all the dogs came and stood by him and then he asked them to take a hold of her. They tore her apart and took all the gold and silver they had taken from other people, and went off to his poor parents with it; and that's when he traveled back to the capital.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en Dreng der havde Lyst til at komme ud og se sig omkring i Verden. Saa tr&#xE6;ffer han paa en gammel Heks, der giver ham tre Hunde: Burenbrak, St&#xE6;rkendreng og Sn&#xE6;rvind, og saa giver hun ham ogsaa en Fl&#xF8;jte; med den kunde han fl&#xF8;jte Hundene til sig, ihvor han saa var.

Saa kommer hun med noget Gr&#xF8;d og M&#xE6;lk til ham og sagde, han skulde v&#xE6;re saa god at &#xE6;de et godt Livfuld af det, for det blev det sidste, han fik.

Saa faar han Kvarter ved en Kone i Byen, og han sp&#xF8;rger hende jo om, hvad det havde at betyde. &#x201D;Jo,&#x201D; siger hun, &#x201D;Kongen har tre Gange v&#xE6;ret i Havsn&#xF8;d, og han har ogsaa tre D&#xF8;tre; hem har han lovet hen til tre Havm&#xE6;nd, for at de skulde hj&#xE6;lpe ham i Land.&#x201D; Nu skulde den ene Datter gives hen i Morgen. &#x201D;Er der ingen, der kan redde hende?&#x201D; siger Drengen. Jo, der var rigtig nok en, der hed Ridder R&#xF8;d, han havde b&#xF8;dere sig til, men hun kunde ikke vide, om han kunde! &#x201D;Ja, saa vil a da blive hertil Middagstid,&#x201D; siger Drengen, &#x201D;for at a kan faa det at se.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, du kan nok faa det at se,&#x201D; siger hun, &#x201D;men det er vist ikke raadeligt for dig at komme alt for meget i N&#xE6;rheden!&#x201D; Saa kom Prinsessen ogsaa kj&#xF8;rende forbi og sat ned paa Stranden, og Ridder R&#xF8;d var med. Han havde to ladte Pistoler med sig, men han kr&#xF8;b op i et stort Tr&#xE6;. Saa kommer Drengen derud, og da sad Prinsessen og gr&#xE6;d. Han vil saa have hende til at fort&#xE6;lle, hvad hun gr&#xE6;d for, og det fortalte hun ogsaa. &#x201D;Er der da ingen, der kan frelse dig?&#x201D; siger han. &#x201D;Nej, der var ikke,&#x201D; siger hun, &#x201D;for Ridder R&#xF8;d har nok lovet det, men han er bange og sidder oppe i det store Tr&#xE6;. Skynd dig nu at komme afsted herfra, for nu kommer Dragen snart!&#x201D; siger hun. Ja, om han da ikke maatte blive. &#x201D;Jo, det maa du jo godt, men saa skal du d&#xF8; ogsaa, det bliver ikke til andet!&#x201D; Ja, han skulde d&#xF8; en Gang alligevel, han vilde da pr&#xF8;ve, hvor galt det kunde gaa! Ved de Ord smilte hun et bitte Korn til ham. Saa sad hun og bandt hendes Ring i hans lange Haar. Men saa med &#xE9;t kom Havmanden susende og b&#xF8;dlende ude i Havet, og han havde saa meget Vand om sig, te det havde n&#xE6;r taget baade Drengen og Prinsessen med sig. Han br&#xF8;lte saa til ham: &#x201D;Sidder du her ved min!&#x201D; Dertil svarte Drengen: &#x201D;Ja, det var min, f&#xF8;r det blev din, og kan vel ogsaa blive det igjen!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det vil vi snubbes om!&#x201D; Saa siger Drengen til Burenbrak, te han skal tage ved ham. Den afsted derhen og rendte ham omkuld og toge saa i Kardusere af ham og bed hans Hoveder af lige paa &#xE9;n Gang. Nu var Prinsessen altsaa frelst. Han lujt saa Munden op og tog Tungen ud, og den gjemte han i hans Lommekl&#xE6;de. Nu vilde han til at gaa, men saa sagde hun til ham, at det maatte han da paa ingen Maade! Jo, han vilde afsted, og han rejste ogsaa af. Nu kom Ridder R&#xF8;d ned af Tr&#xE6;et, og han truede hende med, at han vilde skyde hende, hvis hun ikke gik ind paa at tilstaa for hendes Fader, at han havde frelst hende. Han tog saa Hovedet af Dragen med sig i Vognen, og saa f&#xF8;rte han Prinsessen hjem til hendes Fader. Men Drengen var jo tagen tilbage til den gamle Kone. Hun siger: &#x201D;Saa kunde Ridder R&#xF8;d endda faa Magt med Dragen, for nu er Prinsessen kommen tilbage.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, han kunde jo saa,&#x201D; sagde Drengen. Dagen efter skulde saa den anden Prinsesse afsted. Den &#xE6;ldste S&#xF8;ster havde listet sig til at hviske til hende, te en Dreng med tre Hunde havde frelst hende. Ridder R&#xF8;d kj&#xF8;rte hende saa ned og kr&#xF8;b som s&#xE6;dvanlig op i Tr&#xE6;et. Saa kom Drengen og spurgte, hvad hun sad og gr&#xE6;d for. &#x201D;Ja, a kan nok have noget at gr&#xE6;de for,&#x201D; siger hun, &#x201D;for nu kommer Dragen snart, og Ridder R&#xF8;d har forladt mig. Du maa helst se at komme bort nu, ellers tager han dig ogsaa!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, han har ikke faaet dig end,&#x201D; siger Drengen, &#x201D;lad os nu se, hvordan det kan gaa!&#x201D; Saa sad hun og bandt hendes Ring i hans Haar ved siden af S&#xF8;sterens. Nu kom Havmanden susende og b&#xF8;dlende, og han havde saa meget Vand om sig, te det n&#xE6;r havde taget Prinsessen og Drengen med sig. Den Havmand havde to Hoveder, og han br&#xF8;lte: &#x201D;Sidder du her ved min!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det var min, f&#xF8;r det blev din,&#x201D; sagde Drengen, &#x201D;og det kan vel ogsaa blive det igjen!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det vil snubbes om.&#x201D; Saa raaber Drengen paa St&#xE6;rkendreng, han skal gj&#xF8;e det af med ham, og han flyver til, men han kan ikke gj&#xF8;re det ene, og saa maa han have kaldt paa Sn&#xE6;rvind. Nu var begge Hunde om ham, og saa split de ham ad. Drengen tog saa Tungerne ud og gjemte, og saa vilde han afsted. Prinsessen h&#xE6;ngte i ham; han skulde have blevet og fulgt med hende hjem, men det vilde han ikke, og saa rejste han af. Saa kom Ridder R&#xF8;d og truede hende til at sige, det var ham, der havde frelst hende. Der kom en lukket Vogn ned at hente dem, og han tog Dragehovederne med sig hjem. Saa kommer den tredje Dag, og da skal den tredje Prinsesse afsted. De to &#xE6;ldste havde ikke tejen det til hende alligevel, men havde hvisket til hende, te en Dreng med tre Hunde havde frelst dem. Han kommer saa ned til hende, og da hun saa hendes S&#xF8;stres Ringe i hans Haar, saa bandt hun ogsaa hendes ved og spurgte, om han vilde blive venner (ved hende). Saa kom Havmanden, og han havde tre Hoveder, og han f&#xF8;rte saa meget Vand med sig, te det havde n&#xE6;r skyllet Ridder R&#xF8;d med sig ogsaa. Han br&#xF8;lte jo: &#x201D;Sidder du her ved min!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det var min, f&#xF8;r det blev din, og kan vel ogsaa blive det igjen!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det vil vi snubbes om,&#x201D; siger Dragen, og saa pudser Drengen Sn&#xE6;rvind paa ham. Men han kunde ikke magte ham, og til sidst maatte alle tre Hunde have fat, og de sloges l&#xE6;nge med ham: De to Hoveder fik de af straks, men det tredje kneb det med. Endelig fik de dog Magten og rev ogsaa det af. Nu vilde Drengen afsted, men Prinsessen bad ham om at blive og holdt paa ham, og han maatte da til sidst love, at han vilde komme igjen efter en Tidlang. Saa tog han jo tungene med sig og kom hjem til den gamle Kone. Nu kom Ridder R&#xF8;d ned, og han truede hende til at love, at hun vilde have ham til hendes Mand. Saa kom de hjem, og han havde Hovederne med sig. Nu blev der jo gjrt stor Stads af ham, og Kongen gik ind paa, at han skulde have den sidste Prinsesse til &#xC6;gte, og der blev saa stilt an til Bryllup. Nu var Drengen rejst bort en Tid, men saa kom han igjen, og da glimrede al Ting paa Slottet med Stads og Flag. Saa kommer han ned til den gamle Kone og siger: &#x201D;Naa, nu er de vel gift?&#x201D; Nej, de var da ikke endnu, men i Dag skulde Brylluppet staaa. Som de saa sidder ved Taffelet, siger Drengen til Burenbrak, han skal l&#xF8;be op og hente den Flaske Vin, der staar for F&#xE6;stemanden og Bruden. Det gj&#xF8;r den ogsaa, og da Bruden faa Hunden at se, saa bliver hun saa hvid under &#xD8;jnene, te hun havde n&#xE6;r Daanet. Hunden kommer tilbage med Flasken, og saa sender han St&#xE6;rkendreng afsted efter noget af det Br&#xF8;d, der er paa Bordet, og det kneb sv&#xE6;rt for den at faa det. Endelig vil Drengen selv hen og se, hvordan de holdt Bryllup, og han gaar saa op til Slottet og tager hans Hunde med sig. Da han kommer, gaar de to Prinsesser op og ned ad Gulvet og hviskede. Saa siger Ridder R&#xF8;d, om de Hunde kunde ikke blive jaget ud, og Kongen han rejser sig fra Bordet. Men Drengen siger, om de ikke nok maatte gaa, han t&#xE6;nkte, han var velkommen, og saa sp&#xF8;rger han Ridder R&#xF8;d, om han var kommen &#xE6;rlig til den Kone, han der havde faaet sig. Jo, han havde vundet hende ved at frelse hende fra Dragen, og det var der Bevis for i de 3 Hoveder, der stod! Saa siger Drengen: &#x201D;Hvem mon her har mest Ret til at tale om det, enten den, der har Hovederne, eller den, der har Tungerne?&#x201D; Saa kunde Kongen nok forstaa, dether var galt. Han saa Tungerne, og han satte dem i Hovederne, og saa maatte Ridder R&#xF8;d gaa til Bekjendelse. Han blev saa d&#xF8;mt til D&#xF8;den, og Drengen kom saa paa Pladsen ved Taffelet for ham og blev gift med den yngste Prinsesse.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a boy who wanted to get out and look around in the world. Then he meets an old witch who gives him three dogs: Burenbrak, St&#xE6;rkendreng and Sn&#xE6;rvind, and then she also gives him a whistle which he could use to whistle the dogs to him, regardless of where he was. Now as he traveled about, he comes into a large forest, and he comes to an isolated place there; it was in fact a robbers&#x2019; fort. No one was at home except for an old woman and he asks her if he could have lodgings there for the night. Sure, he certainly could, but she did not want to have the dogs in with him. Here was a room, they could stay there until the next morning, and then he could come get them. Then she comes with some porridge and milk for him and said that he was welcome to eat a big bowl of that, because it would be the last thing he got. Well, he got that, and when he had finished eating, he says: &#x201C;Can I take this here whistle and amuse myself with it for a little while?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Sure, you can whistle as much as you want,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;but you will never get your dogs again!&#x201D; Because while he had been eating she had warmed up a kettle of water and thrown it in at them, and so she figured that they were dead. But as soon as he blew on his whistle, all the dogs came and stood by him. So he took all the gold and silver there was in the robbers&#x2019; den, they had taken that from other people, and traveled home to his poor parents with it. Now he decided that he wanted to take a trip to the capital with his dogs, since they were so strong they could knock everything down. When he got there, the Royal castle was covered in black. Then he gets lodgings with a woman in the town, and he asks her what that was supposed to mean. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;the King has been in trouble three times, and he also has three daughters; he has promised them to three mermen in exchange for their help here in the country.&#x201D; Now the one daughter was to be handed over later that morning. &#x201C;Is there no one who can save her?&#x201D; says the boy. Well, there is in fact one, who is called the Red Knight, he had offered, but she didn&#x2019;t know if he really could. &#x201C;Well, then I&#x2019;ll stay here until noon,&#x201D; says the boy, &#x201C;so I can get to see that.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, you can certainly get to see it,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;but it probably is not too good to get too close!&#x201D; Then the princess came driving by and was put down on the beach, and the Red Knight was with her. He had two loaded pistols with him, but he climbed up into a big tree. Then the boy goes out there, and the princess was sitting there crying. He wanted her to tell him what she was crying about, and she told him too. &#x201C;Is there no one who can save you?&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;No, there isn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;because the Red Knight promised to, but he&#x2019;s afraid and is sitting up in a big tree. Hurry up and get out of here, because the dragon will be coming soon!&#x201D; she says. Well, couldn&#x2019;t he stay? &#x201C;Sure, you may, but then you&#x2019;ll die too, there&#x2019;s no way around it.&#x201D; Well, he was going to die at some point anyway, he wanted to see how bad things could go! With those words, she smiled a little at him. Then she sat and bound her ring in his long hair. But then all of a sudden the merman came whistling and roaring out of the sea, and he had so much water around him that it almost took the princess and boy with it. He roared at him: &#x201C;Are you sitting here with mine!&#x201D; The boy answers that: &#x201C;Well, it was mine before it was yours, and can certainly become that again!&#x201D; Then the boy says to Burenbrak, that he should attack him. It runs over there and knocked him out and grabbed his necks and bit all his heads off all at once. Now the princess had been saved. He opened the mouth and took the tongue out, and he hid it in his handkerchief. Now he wanted to leave, but then she said to him, that he absolutely could not! Well, he wanted to leave and so he did. Now the Red Knight comes down out of the tree and he threatened that he would shoot her if she didn&#x2019;t tell her father that he had saved her. He took the head of the dragon with him in the wagon, and then he brought the princess home to her father. But the boy had gone back to the old woman. She says: &#x201C;So, the Red Knight managed to get power over the dragon after all, since now the princess has come back.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, he managed to,&#x201D; said the boy. The next day, the second princess was to go off. The oldest sister had managed to whisper to her that a boy with three dogs had saved her. The Red Knight drove her down there and crawled as usual up the tree. Then the boy came and asked what she was sitting there crying about. &#x201C;Well, I have enough to cry about,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;because the dragon is coming soon, and the Red Knight has abandoned me. You&#x2019;d better see about getting out of here now, otherwise he&#x2019;ll take you too!&#x201D; &#x2013;Well, he hasn&#x2019;t gotten you yet, says the boy, &#x201C;let&#x2019;s see how things can go!&#x201D; Then she sat and bound her ring in his hair beside her sister&#x2019;s. Now the merman came whistling and roaring, and he had so much water about him that it almost took the princess and the boy with it. That merman had two heads, and he roared: &#x201C;Are you sitting here with mine!&#x201D; --  &#x201C;Well, it was mine before it was yours,&#x201D; says the boy, &#x201C;and can certainly become that again!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, we&#x2019;ll fight over that.&#x201D; Then the boy calls for St&#xE6;rkendreng, he should off him, and he flies at him, but he can&#x2019;t do it alone, and so he has to call for Sn&#xE6;rvind. Now both dogs were on him, and then they destroyed him. The boy took the tongues out and hid them, and then wanted to leave. The princess hung on to him; he should have stayed and accompanied her home, but he didn&#x2019;t want to do that, and then he left. Then the Red Knight came and threatened her and made her say that it was he who had saved her. A closed wagon came to get them, and he took the dragon heads along home. Then the third day comes, and the third princess is to go off. The two oldest hadn&#x2019;t blabbered to her after all, but they had whispered to her that a boy with three dogs had saved them. He comes down to her, and when she saw her sisters&#x2019; rings in his hair, she bound her ring there too and asked if they could be friends. Then the merman came, and he had three heads and he brought so much water with him he almost managed to wash the Red Knight away as well. He roared: &#x201C;Are you sitting here with mine!&#x201D; --  &#x201C;Well, it was mine before it was yours, and can certainly become that again!&#x201D; -- &#x201C;Well, we&#x2019;ll fight over that,&#x201D; says the dragon and then the boy sics Sn&#xE6;rvind on him. But he couldn&#x2019;t overpower him, and finally all three dogs had to take hold, and they fought with him for quite a while: they got two of the heads off immediately, but there was a problem with the third one. Finally they got control and ripped that one off too. Now the boy wanted to leave, but the princess asked him to stay and held on to him, and he had to finally promise that he would come again after a while. Then he took the tongues along with him and he went home to the old woman. Then the Red Knight came down and he threatened her and made her promise that she would take him as her husband. Then they got home and he had the heads with him. Now he was greatly honored and the king agreed that he should marry the last princess and they started to prepare for a wedding. Now the boy had traveled off a while but then he had come back again and everything was shining at the castle with decorations and flags. Then he goes in to the old woman and says: &#x201C;Well, they&#x2019;re probably married now.&#x201D; No, they weren&#x2019;t yet, but the wedding was today. As they are sitting down to the table, the boy says to Burenbrak, he should run up and get them the bottle of wine that was in front of the bride and groom. It does that too, and when the bride sees the dog, she gets so white under her eyes that she almost fainted. The dog comes back with the bottle and then he sends St&#xE6;rkendreng up to get some of the bread that is on the table, and it had a really hard time getting it. Finally the boy wants to go up and see how they held a wedding and goes up to the castle and takes his dogs with him. When he gets there, the two princesses are walking up and down the floor, whispering. Then the Red Knight asks if the dogs couldn&#x2019;t be chased out, and the king gets up from the table. But the boy asks if they couldn&#x2019;t stay, he thought he was welcome, and then he asks the Red Knight if he had gotten that wife honestly. Yes, he had won her by saving her from the dragon, and the evidence was the three heads sitting there!&#x201D; Then the boy says: &#x201C;Who has the most right to speak of that, the one who has the heads, or the one who has the tongues?&#x201D; Then the king understood that this was wrong. He saw the tongues and he put them in the heads, and then the Red Knight had to admit everything. He was sentenced to death and the boy was then celebrated at the table there and he was married to the youngest princess.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen labels this ballad "Hver med sit s&#xE6;rkjende" [Each with their own distinctive feature]. Here, Jens offers a virtual catalog of all the different people one could expect to encounter in the parish. The distinctive feature of each profession is ostensibly a characteristic item of clothing, such as a hat or a collar, or a characteristic tool. But that feature is only a lead-in to their other particular characteristic--corruption, hypocrisy, self-centeredness, trickery, manipulation, sexual promiscuity, slovenliness. 

     Most of the professions mentioned in the song are not particularly high status, and so one cannot read it solely as a critique of the upper classes and their poor treatment of the rural farming classes. Indeed, only the bailiff and the minister would have been considered to be among the higher social classes. 

     Tang Kristensen's published version is based on seven variants. This approach of concatenating versions explains the significant divergence of the published version from the manuscript record. Tang Kristensen also elides the obscene aspects of several verses or simply deletes them, replacing them with ellipses.</annotation>

The cobbler with his awl and his shoe thread,
he&#x2019;ll likely go to hell,
he pokes and he sews ....

The tailor with his needle and his thread,
his ass has opened up, he sews on top of it,
he sews and he pricks, on pockets and on purses

The weaver with his hooked staff
he&#x2019;ll move to hell at some point
because he cuts clothes off, and sells the remaining threads off

The weaver woman with her loom and her shuttle
she weaves herself down into hell&#x2019;s puddle
because she steals yarn, and she tricks people

The hired girl with her little keys
she gladly let&#x2019;s herself be ...
she whispers and she sweeps the farmhand&#x2019;s bed shrimp. 
It rumbles, it rumbles, it bum bummelum

    <annotation>Stories about cunning folk finding lost sheep are widely attested (JPP 1.06, JPP 4.13, JPP 4.14), and the recovery of the sheep seems to mitigate Jens's otherwise dismissive attitude toward Villads. Otherwise, Jens provides a clear indictment of cunning folk and the dishonesty of their endeavors. The connection between the black book of magic, Cyprianus, and Satan, is made explicit here. Given the first story in this sequence of two stories, though, and Jens's generally playful attitude, it seems unlikely that Jens believes this story. Of course, the story may represent the type of negotiation of belief that is a characteristic of the legend dialectic (D&#xE9;gh 2001).

Referring to the devil by a name other than his own is common as a common belief holds that, if one mentions the devil by name, he will appear. Here, Jens refers to him as "Old Jerrik," a dialect variant of the common "Old Erik"; interestingly, the manuscript gives "Old Erik" (Gl. Erik), indicating that Tang Kristensen added the dialect referent during his later transcription.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Old Villads over here in Ersted-- in the westernmost and the southernmost farm--he was a real witchmaster and he could talk to these here mound dwellers and elves whenever he wanted. There was one who lived in a mound south of the road out on his field, called Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, there&#x2019;s a gravel pit there now. They called him the Kringelbj&#xE6;rg man and he could talk to him whenever he wanted to. So one night, they were sitting there drinking, it was him and Kold Per from the most north-westerly farm and S&#xF8;ren &#xD8;stergaard, who later wound up living in Tveden, they were sitting there one night and had some drinks. Then he begins boasting that he can talk to this mound dweller whenever he wants, and if they&#x2019;d follow him up to Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, then he&#x2019;d call him so they could see him and talk to him. They had to walk three times around the mound, &#x201C;and when I bang three times down on the mound with my staff, then he&#x2019;ll come goddammit.&#x201D; Well, they walk around the mound three times and then Villads bangs his staff down on the ground, and calls out to him, &#x201C;Hey mound dweller, come out here, there are two who want to talk to you.&#x201D; -- &#x201C;There are three,&#x201D; said Kolde-Per. He wouldn&#x2019;t come. He hit a second time, and no one came. &#x201C;Well, when I hit this third time, he&#x2019;ll come goddammit.&#x201D; He figured that maybe they&#x2019;d get scared. He hit the third time, but no one would come out. Up here in the forest lived a man name S&#xF8;ren Bavlstrup, and his dog began barking really loudly. &#x201C;Goddammit, now I know what&#x2019;s happened, he&#x2019;s up there, so he won&#x2019;t be coming out to us tonight.&#x201D; So that&#x2019;s how Villads got out of it, because they have to use lies and whatever else they can.
     He saw them so often, he saw that they walked from the Bavnh&#xF8;j sheep pen and from there out to Kringelbj&#xE6;rg and they carried wax torches or candles in their hands and he saw them like that whenever they were walking. Once there was a flock of sheep that got away down by Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, and if he hadn&#x2019;t been as cunning, he never would have got them again. He had his books and he could talk to Old Erik. He read up from them. He had a Cyprianus.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Den gamle Villads her i Ersted &#x2014; han boede i den allervesterste og s&#xF8;nderste g&#xE5;rd &#x2014; det var s&#xE5;dan en heksemester, og han kunde komme deher bj&#xE6;rgm&#xE6;nd og ellefolk i tale, n&#xE5;r han vilde. S&#xE5; boede der en bj&#xE6;rgmand ude p&#xE5; hans mark i en bakke, der hedder Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, s&#xF8;nden for vejen til &#xC5;restrup, der er en grusgrav i den nu, og ham kaldte de Kringelbj&#xE6;rgmanden. Se, ham sagde gamle Villads, at han kunde komme i tale, n&#xE5;r han vilde.  S&#xE5; var det en aften, at han og Kolde-Per og S&#xF6;ren &#xD6;sterg&#xE5;rd &#x2014; det var netop ham, der siden kom til at bo i Tveden &#x2014; de sad og svirede i den nordvestligste g&#xE5;rd her i byen, og da de havde f&#xE5;et dem nogle dramme, s&#xE5; begynder Villads at prale af, at han kan komme denher bj&#xE6;rgmand i tale, og dersom de vilde f&#xF8;lges med ham op til Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, s&#xE5; skulde han kalde p&#xE5; ham, s&#xE5; de kunde f&#xE5; ham at se og komme til at snakke med ham. Ja, de vilde da godt med, sagde de, m&#xE5;ske fordi han ikke skulde tro, det kunde forskr&#xE6;kke dem. S&#xE5; rejser de jo af derud med hverandre, og s&#xE5; siger Villads, hvordan de har at forholde dem. "Nu skal vi g&#xE5; tre gange omkring bj&#xE6;rget, og n&#xE5;r a s&#xE5; sl&#xE5;r tre gange i bj&#xE6;rget med min kj&#xE6;p, s&#xE5; kommer han mossel." N&#xE5;, de spaserer jo omkring bj&#xE6;rget, og s&#xE5; sl&#xE5;r Villads ned i jorden med kj&#xE6;ppen og r&#xE5;ber &#xE5;p&#xE5; ham: "Dav bj&#xE6;rremand, kom her ud, der er to, der vil tale med dig!" &#x2014; "Der er tre," sagde Kolde-Per. Men han vilde ikke komme. Han slog anden gang, og der kom ingen. "Ja, n&#xE5;r a sl&#xE5;r nu tredje gang, s&#xE5; kommer han mossel." Han t&#xE6;nkte m&#xE5;ske, de skulde v&#xE6;re blevne forskr&#xE6;kkede og rendt deres vej. N&#xE5;, s&#xE5; slog han tredje gang, men der vilde ingen til at komme. I det samme giver en hund sig til at gj&#xF8; s&#xE5; st&#xE6;rkt, det var netop S&#xF6;ren Bravlstrups her oppe ved skoven. "Nu v&#xE9;d a mossel besked," sagde gamle Villads, "bj&#xE6;rgmanden er g&#xE5;et derop, og p&#xE5; den m&#xE5;de kan han jo da ikke komme ud til os i aften." S&#xE5;dan slap Villads for at kalde bj&#xE6;rgmanden frem, for de skal jo beg&#xE5; dem med l&#xF6;gn, og hvordan de kan, n&#xE5;r de kan ikke n&#xE6;rere.
     Villads s&#xE5; s&#xE5; tit deher bj&#xE6;rgfolk, han s&#xE5;, de gik og spaserede fra Bavnh&#xF6;j og ned til degnens f&#xE5;resti, og derfra og ud til Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, og de gik og tog hverandre i armen og havde voksfakler eller lys i h&#xE5;nden. Der var en gang et kobbel f&#xE5;r, der slap ned for ham i Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, og havde han ikke haft s&#xE5; meget mere klogskab, s&#xE5; havde han aldrig f&#xE5;et dem igjen; men han l&#xE6;ste dem op, for han havde Cyprianus og hans b&#xF8;ger og kunde komme Gamle-Jerrik i tale.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Old Villads over here in Ersted--he lived in the westernmost and the southernmost farm--he was so great a witchmaster that he could talk to these here mound dwellers and elves whenever he wanted. There was a hidden man (mound man) who lived in a hill out on his field, called Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, south of the road to &#xC5;restrup, there&#x2019;s a gravel pit there now, and they called him the Kringelbj&#xE6;rg man. You see, old Villads said he could talk to him whenever he wanted to. So one night, he and Kolde-Per and S&#xF8;ren &#xD8;stergaard--it was in fact he who later wound up living in Tveden--they sat drinking in the most north-westerly farm here in the town and after they had had several drams, Villads begins boasting that he can talk to this here mound dweller, and if they&#x2019;d follow him up to Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, then he&#x2019;d call him so they could see him and get to talk to him. Sure, they&#x2019;d gladly go along, they said, maybe so that he wouldn&#x2019;t think that this might scare them. So then they leave with each other and then Villads tells them what to do. &#x201C;Now we&#x2019;re to walk three times around the mound, and when I bang three times down on the mound with my staff, then he&#x2019;ll come, goddammit.&#x201D; Well, they walk around the mound and then Villads bangs his staff down on the ground, and calls out to him, &#x201C;Hey mound dweller, come out here, there are two who want to talk to you.&#x201D; -- &#x201C;There are three,&#x201D; said Kolde-Per.

Well, then he hit a third time, but no one would come out. At the same time, a dog began barking really loudly, it was S&#xF8;ren Bravlstrup&#x2019;s from up here near the forest. &#x201C;Goddammit, now I know what&#x2019;s happened,&#x201D; said Villads, &#x201C;the mound dweller has gone up there, and so he can&#x2019;t come out to us tonight.&#x201D; So that&#x2019;s how Villads got out of calling the mound dweller out, because they have to fill them with lies and whatever else they can when they can't do any better.
     Villads saw the mound dwellers so often, he saw that they walked from Bavnh&#xF8;j and down to the parish clerk&#x2019;s sheep pen and from there out to Kringelbj&#xE6;rg; and they walked with their arms around each other and were carrying wax torches or candles. Once there was a flock of sheep that got away from him down by Kringelbj&#xE6;rg, and if he hadn&#x2019;t been as cunning, he never would have got them again; but he read them up, since he had a Cyprianus and his books, and he could talk to Old Jerrik.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The charcoal maker (collier) finds himself alone in the forest late at night, yet engaged in an important economic activity--a situation ripe for supernatural contact. Here, the elf hag, known as a seductress from other stories, approaches him, ostensibly to warm herself. The man assaults her--in this case, sexually--and she in turn calls for assistance.

     The story is closely related to Jens Peter's story of the injured mermaid, who calls to the merman to protect her (JPP 2.20 and JPP 4.02). In both cases, the man guarding a solitary refinery burns the supernatural being. The being responds with an obscure exclamation, similar to the statement in the legend of Pan's death (JPP 4.12). Unlike Jens Peter's story, Bitte Jens includes the clever response of the collier that allows him enough time to escape from the trolls. The resulting destruction is similar in both stories. 

     Peat was commonly used as a heating fuel. Although it burned at a low temperature and created a lot of smoke, it was readily available. Charcoal, by contrast, burned cleanly at a high temperature, and for a long time. It was not commonly used to heat houses since wood was scarce; rather it was used for fires that needed to be hot such as those used for smithing. Charcoal was made in a pit, referred to as a pile, by directly burning the wood that was to become charcoal. Making charcoal in pits was difficult and the piles required a great deal of attention from the colliers. Oxygen entering the pit was regulated, so that the charcoal itself did not burn. An abandoned pile could burn out of control and quite possibly explode.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>They also told a story like that about a man from Rold, it was also about these mound dwellers. He was sleeping out in the forest burning charcoal, that's what they used to do. When they bought timber in the forests, they burned the top down to charcoal. So this elf woman comes and pulls up her skirt and stood there warming herself by his charcoal stack. Then he thought that she should be warmed up a bit better. He reaches in and takes out a stick and shoves it up between her thighs. "What's your name?" she says. "Myself," he says. Well, then she shouts, "Fussibu (this had to be Faare Lake and there was a swamp there called Fossi Mose [Fossi Swamp]) and Trussitrold (there's a lake out there they call [Troll lake] Tryss&#xF8;, right next to the road from Tveden to Rold), Bukkjar's hags and Ald&#xE5;l's boy, little pussy has been burned." (Bukkj&#xE6;r is in there in Roldkj&#xE6;r and it was also in Rold Forest that he was burning charcoal. Aldal is just opposite Stubberup, and there used to be a road up there, but one year it collapsed almost completely). As soon as she'd said that, they were all standing there next to her (friends). "Who did it?" "Myself! Myself!" Then they thought that she'd done it herself, and it took a while to figure it out, and the man had almost gotten home. As soon as he got inside and closed the door, they were there and pounded on the door, but he'd been saved then. The next morning he went out to the forest, all his charcoal stacks had been smashed to pieces. They'd done that to him.</english_manuscript>

N&#xE5;r de kj&#xF6;bte tr&#xE6;er i skoven, s&#xE5; br&#xE6;ndte de al tid toppen i kul og havde en hel del kulmiler at passe.

    <english_publication>There was a similar story about a man from Rold, who was in the company of these elf hags. He was sleeping out in the forest burning charcoal, that was the practice in the olden days. When they bought timber in the forests, they always burned the top down to charcoal and had a large number of charcoal stacks to take care of. Now this man was out in the forest one night taking care of his stacks, and then this elf woman comes and pulls up her skirt and stands there warming herself by the stack. Then he thought that she should be warmed a bit better, and he takes a stick out of the stack and pokes it at her. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Myself,&#x201D; he says. Well, then she yells out, &#x201C;Fussibu and Trussitrold, Bukkj&#xE6;r hags and Ald&#xE5;ls boys, little pussy has been burned.&#x201D; Just as she said that, all those she had called stood there next to her. &#x201C;Who did it?&#x201D; they shouted. &#x201C;Myself! Myself!&#x201D; Then they thought that she&#x2019;d done it herself, and it took so long to figure it out that the man had managed to get home in the meantime, he&#x2019;d thought it wisest to get out of there. Just as he&#x2019;d gotten inside and closed the door, they were there and pounded on the door, but he was saved. The next morning, when he went out into the forest, all his charcoal stacks had been smashed to pieces. They&#x2019;d done that to him. Now it was in Rold forest that he burned charcoal, and Bukkj&#xE6;r and Aldal are a couple of places there in the forest. Aldal is just across from Stubberup, and there was a road up the dale, but one year it collapsed almost completely. Trussitrold lived most likely in Try Lake, which is next to the road from Tveden to Rold, and Fussibuu probably lived in Fossi swamp, which is close to F&#xE5;re lake. Elves lived in the hill they called Stubberup House. People hauled firewood there in the forest and burned charcoal stacks.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Stories about robbers and their exploits are widely attested. Numerous stories that attest to Queen Margaret I attacking robbers near Egholm Castle (DS IV 146). Robber dens are usually located in wooded or hilly areas, and the area south of Gammel Sk&#xF8;rping provides such cover. The Queen is too clever for the robbers, and her army manages to destroy them. 

      Stubberup farm lies several hundred meters to the south of Ersted. South of that, and on the east side of Lindenborg River is a ruin marked as ""Subberuphus voldsted"" [walls of Stubberuphus]. Just to the west of Gammel Sk&#xF8;rping is a mound 142 feet high, noted on maps as Margreteh&#xF8;j. This mound is linked in other stories to Margaret's exploits with the robbers (DS IV 146). Sk&#xF8;rping marsh stretches for several kilometers to the south. The distance from Sk&#xF8;rping marsh to Stubberuphus voldsted is approximately six and a half kilometers.

     Egholm Castle, which lies on a small island south east of Sk&#xF8;rping, has a history dating back to the time of King Valdemar Sejr (1202-1241). The main building at Egholm was in fact blown to smithereens in 1765, not by the Queen but by its owner at the time, Frederik Chr. Rosenkrands, who later became prime minister. Early maps note the ruins at Egholm Castle to the north and west of Gammel Sk&#xF8;rping. In other stories, Margaret's stone is located close to the castle walls of Egholm (DS IV 151).

     In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen concatenates, and rearranges several of Jens's stories, presenting a series of tangentially related stories as a coherent whole. The published version is made up of stories BJK 1.25, BJK 1.27 and BJK 1.36.</annotation>

    <danish_publication>     Der har v&#xE6;ret et r&#xF8;verslot et bitte korn s&#xF8;nden for Aldal der nede ved &#xE5;en. Dronning Margrete l&#xE5; s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge med hendes kavalleri og artilleri, inden hun fik det skudt ned. Der ligger en stor sten der nede ved Skj&#xF6;rping kj&#xE6;r et sted, de kalder den dronning Margretes sten, og den sad hun p&#xE5;, mens de sk&#xF8;d slottet ned. Det r&#xF8;verslot kaldtes Stubberuphus. Lige s&#xE5;dan fort&#xE6;ller de og, det er g&#xE5;et Egholm slot. Nogle af stenene derfra blev f&#xF8;rt til Skj&#xF6;rping, og man tr&#xE6;der p&#xE5; dem, n&#xE5;r man g&#xE5;r ind ad Skj&#xF6;rping kirked&#xF8;r. Omkring Egholm og Stubberup har der v&#xE6;ret store grave. Der er et stort hul inde i Ersted skov, de kalder R&#xF8;verstuen, og da r&#xF8;verne der h&#xF8;rte, at de havde skudt Stubberuphus ned, turde de ikke v&#xE6;re hjemme l&#xE6;ngere, og s&#xE5;dan blev det r&#xF8;verkram &#xF8;delagt her p&#xE5; egnen.

     Der har st&#xE5;et b&#xE5;de &#xE6;ble- og blommetr&#xE6;er og stikkelsb&#xE6;rris p&#xE5; det sted, hvor slottet l&#xE5;. Nogle har nok sagt, at det ikke har v&#xE6;ret andet end en h&#xF6;j, og Jens Krog i &#xC5;restrup gik endog s&#xE5; vidt, at han sagde: "Mon der har v&#xE6;ret r&#xF8;vere her?" men han var nu ogs&#xE5; s&#xE5; vantro. Min fader har fortalt mig, at der var b&#xE5;de kalk og sten, de kunde prikke det op med deres kj&#xE6;ppe.
     Hofmand, der boede p&#xE5; Stubberuphus, skal v&#xE6;re bleven sl&#xE5;et ihjel i en tvekamp.
     R&#xF8;verne i den oven omtalte r&#xF8;verkule tog en gang amtmanden fra Aalborg.  Han havde v&#xE6;ret i Randers at holde bryllup. De skjulte dem i en stor hul eg noget n&#xE6;r ovre ved Rold skov, til han kom.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a robbers&#x2019; fort a little bit south of Aldal down there by the river. Queen Margaret stayed for so long with her cavalry and artillery before she managed to get it blown up. There&#x2019;s a big stone down there by Skj&#xF8;rping marsh some place, they call it Queen Margaret&#x2019;s stone, and she sat on it while they blew up the fort. The robbers&#x2019; fort was called Stubberuphus. They also say that the same thing happened to Egholm Castle. Some of the stones from there were brought to Skj&#xF8;rping, and you walk on them when you go in through the door of Skj&#xF8;rping church. Around Egholm and Stubberup there were big moats. There&#x2019;s a big hollow in Ersted forest they call the Robber Den, and when the robbers heard that they&#x2019;d blown up Stubberuphus, they didn&#x2019;t dare stay home any longer, and that&#x2019;s how they destroyed the robbers here in the area. They say otherwise that Queen Margaret used that trick of turning the horse shoes around on her horse, and when the robbers saw the tracks, they thought that she&#x2019;d ridden away, and then she managed to blow up the fort. 
     There were both apple and plum trees and gooseberry bushes at that place where the fort lay. Some have probably said that it wasn&#x2019;t anything more than a mound, and Jens Krog in &#xC5;restrup went so far as to say, &#x201C;I wonder if there have been robbers here?&#x201D; but he wasn&#x2019;t that superstitious.

     Hofmand, who lived at Stubberuphus, was supposed to have been killed in a duel.
     The robbers in the mentioned robber den once took the Amtmand from Aalborg. He&#x2019;d been in Randers at a wedding. They hid themselves in a big hollow over near Rold forest until he came.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The cruel manor lord returns as a guilty haunt. Not only does he threaten the livelihood of the local farmers in life, but he continues to do so after death. Jens provided no detail as to how the revenant was dealt with. The reference to Mylius likely was triggered by mention of Stubberuphus in the previous story, where the unfortunate Hoffman lived. That reference also explains this seeming digression (Georges 1983). Presumably, it is a duel between Mylius and Hoffman that leads to Hoffman's death. 

     Collapsing independent landholdings into one large manor farm was a practice that ended by the late eighteenth century and was, in fact, reversed through partitioning. There had been a long standing prohibition against deserting hearths to prevent the abandonment of land, and to prevent exactly the type of consolidation that Mylius attempts in this story.

     In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen combined and rearranged BJK 1.26 and BJK 1.27 into a single narrative.</annotation>

Hvarregaard used to be a town, but Mylius forced all the farms to be deserted, but he had to build just as many houses as there'd been farms, they weren't allowed to desert hearths like that.

He was called Mylius and the farm was named after him. They called it Skjelhusene, but he wanted to turn it into a big farm, and so he wanted Hvarre farm to be merged into it as well. It was a whole town, but then he lay waste to all the farms. Of course, he had to build just as many houses as there&#x2019;d been farms, they weren&#x2019;t allowed to desert hearths like that, but he got the land. Then when Mylius became owner of the farms, he made them sign papers that allowed him to take any of their property that hindered him. After that, he took the meadows from these copyholders and gave them some heath instead. The old copyholders had had permission to graze their animals in the woods, but he forbade them that as well. The woods was to be fenced in. As the old copyholders died off, he took the meadows, and then they were drained and irrigated. That was at the time that there was supposed to be one big manor lord and a lot of small workers.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens returns to his story of Margrethe's siege of the robbers at Stubberuphus and her clever ruse that leads to their capture (BJK 1.25). Mylius's manipulation of the lands allocated to the local farms allows him to quickly become a large landholder but, along with his poor treatment of his copyholders, it consigns him to becoming a guilty haunt (BJK 1.26).

The robbers didn't dare go home now that they'd blown up Stubberuphus. But now they could see that they'd ridden away from there, and so they rode quickly in and then they were shot. Around Egholm and Stubberup there were big moats.

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen did not publish this short statement about the bridal bed of the King. The statement is somewhat reminiscent of the "George Washington slept here" signs that are a marketing ploy of inns along the east coast of the United States. 

     Christian IV (b.1577-d.1648), was king of Denmark and Norway from 1596 until his death.  He married Anna Kathrine in 1597, and had three of his fifteen children with her, including the later King Frederik III.  He had affairs with Kirsten Madsdatter and Karen Andersdatter, and finally a relationship with Kirsten Munk, with whom he had a written agreement to marry, but never actually wed. Kirsten Munk was the daughter of Ludvig Munk N&#xF8;rlund, the owner of N&#xF8;rlund since 1570.The reference to Christian IV's bridal bed should be understood in the context of Christian's numerous lovers and complicated marital arrangements.</annotation>

    <annotation>The attempt of the farmers to play a seemingly harmless trick on the minister backfires with calamitous results. In that respect, this widely attested legend is closely related to legends of the would-be ghost (ML3005). In most variants of this legend, the minister is called to offer last rites, another parallel to stories of the would-be ghost (DS III 1233). There is a suggestion in some stories that playing tricks on the minister was a common occurrence (DS III 1238). The trick, although seemingly innocuous (and amusingly similar to contemporary "crank calls"), clearly violates the minister's trust. As with stories of the would-be ghost, the stories do not agree on the involvement of the minister in the sinking: does he cause it, or is it caused by the ungodliness of the actions? The forgotten Bible is always recovered.

     The published version is slightly abbreviated, with several inexplicable deletions.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens offers a great number of descriptions of local topography, and provides various explanations for the appearance of certain of these topographical features. These short descriptions echo the detail he provided in his longer narratives that link his stories closely to the local area. 

     One of the major agricultural advances was large-scale drainage projects that allowed heath land to be put under plow. Along with mergling, a process in which marl was added to the soil in the heath, large areas of arable land became available for the establishment of small holdings. Jens's description of the vestiges of plowing near the swamp suggest that swamp was not the "original" state of the land. The story offers indirect support to the large-scale drainage projects that would return the swamp to its "original" state of arability.</annotation>

    <annotation>The encroachment of the heath and, farther north, sand on arable land was a significant threat to farming. In the eighteenth century, there were accounts of farms being abandoned as the heath expanded. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the expansion of the heath had been reversed, and farms were appearing where none had existed before or, as Jens suggests, reappearing where they once had been.</annotation>

    <annotation>The Red Smithy is the name of a pub in Nibe. Although Tang Kristensen's annotation is very short, one can surmise that Jens told a story of the devil at the pub. The devil was probably dressed as a gentleman (V&#xE4;lk 2001). In many stories, the devil arrives at the pub to play cards; when he is recognized, a person at the pub sends for a wise minister or, as in this case, a dean (proust), a person slightly higher up in the church hierarchy. 

     Tang Kristensen did not publish this abbreviated account, likely because he had not recorded the story.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens tells two linked stories of cunning folk, their reputations, and how they were regarded by their cohort. In the first story, Kr&#xE6;n Degn does not join the joking, because he believes that Anders B&#xF8;dker has cursed his fields, leading to considerable financial hardship. Given Anders's response to Poul's request, it seems that Jens is unsure whether to believe the alleged curse or not. The story, in that sense, mimics a similar negotiation that informs the townspeople's interaction with Anders as well. Although Kr&#xE6;n is clearly convinced of Anders's maliciousness (and thus implicitly aligning him with witchcraft), the others seem less convinced.

    The cursed cattle and fields carry over to the curse on technology in the next story. By the second half of the nineteenth century, new types of plows, particularly the swing plow, were replacing the earlier wheeled plows. These plows required fewer draught animals to pull them, yet they also required farmers' to develop new skills to use them effectively.  Pulling out of the furrows, or plowing too deep would, of course, lead to unsatisfactory results. The cunning man appears to be part technician in this story, making adjustments to the poorly functioning plow. While witches are generally blamed for cursing plows, the mare and the Wandering Jew are also known to curse them. 

    Neither Anders B&#xF8;dker, Iver Ott nor Old Villads are mentioned in H. P. Hansen's two volume work on cunning folk (1943) or R&#xF8;rbye's later overview of cunning folk in Denmark (R&#xF8;rbye 1976). The scope of practice of these cunning men is similar to that of many other rural folk healers--here, the focus is on guaranteeing success in agricultural endeavors. Knowledge of cunning, including ownership of books such as the Cyprianus, was frequently passed down in families.

    <english_manuscript>There was one in Gravlev they called Anders B&#xF8;dker. He bewitched Kr&#xE6;n Degn's field on Fl&#xF8;&#xF8;, there was a place as big around as a spinning wheel. As soon as the cattle would get there they'd go completely crazy. They couldn't grow any barley either. But then Jakob Ingvarsen cured it. One time the men from Gravlev got together--in the old days, they got together often. It was over at Poul Isak's and Anders B&#xF8;dker had come too and the Fl&#xF8;&#xF8; men were also there. "Can't you give us half a p&#xE6;gl Poul?" Sure. "Sk&#xE5;l, Anders B&#xF8;dker, now you should let us raise some good barley." "Sure, you'll get some good tall standing barley." He was such a joker that Anders B&#xF8;dker. Then all the men wanted to pour a glass for him so they'd get good barley, and Kr&#xE6;n Degn sat there quietly listening to that. Anders P&#xE5;ske's plow in Fl&#xF8;&#xF8; had also been bewitched one afternoon, when his son had had the animals out in front, and then he couldn't control it at all that afternoon, either it would go to the side or up out of the ground or too deep. Then he had to unhitch the animals and go home to his father. Yes, evil people had done that. They went go over to [old] Iver &#xC5;t, he was Villads's son-in-law, and he'd inherited all his knowledge. He hitches up the wagon and drives over to see him. He came over and read in his books and was going to find out what was wrong with the plow and then he followed along with him and read over the plow and screwed on all the screws and then he had a little drill in his pocket. And a little stick too, and he bored a little hole in the plow axe and he tapped the stick into it. "No one will do that you anymore," he said, and then the plow worked as wonderfully as it had before.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Kidnapping an alderman returning from a wedding is an intriguing representation of threat. In one fell swoop, the robbers disrupt family, make an implicit threat to the fertility of the community, and disrupt the political functions of the entire district (amt).

     Tang Kristensen published this story along with the story of Queen Margaret and the robbers (BJK 1.25), even though there is little to suggest that this story referred to the same events. The events referred to in the other story center on Stubberuphus and Egholm, while this short story focuses on the robber's den in Rold forest.

     The robbers' den in Rold forest, six kilometers southeast of Ersted, is well known and marked on most maps.</annotation>

    <annotation>The home invasion robbery is horrific, and eerily reminiscent of similar stories from contemporary urban centers. The intense fear generated by this particular threat--and the capriciousness of the attack--comes across clearly despite the fragmentary nature of the performance.

     Tang Kristensen published a variant of this story that he collected from Jens during their third session together (BJK 3.37). It seems likely that Tang Kristensen either misheard or misrecorded the location of the assault, since in the later version the victim is said to have bought two houses in Ersted from the counselor at N&#xF8;rlund, six and half kilometers to the southwest. Accordingly, Jens most likely said "Ersted," and Tang Kristensen wrote Erslev. Erslev is a town in Mors, sixty two kilometers west of Ersted.</annotation>

    <annotation>Norwegians are often attributed supernatural power--or at least considered to be cunning--in Danish legend tradition (JPP 4.44). The story of a wandering Norwegian ridding a farm, or even a region, of mice or rats is widely attested (DS VI 1251). In some variants, the wanderer is a Finn, although the magical Finn is not that common in Danish tradition (DS VI 1252). The generosity of the forest ranger, in contrast to the suspicious nature of his wife, is well rewarded. Although beggars and wanderers are often threatening (KMP 1.09), in certain stories, they are considered to be worth helping (KMP 2.08). 

     Mice and rats were a constant problem on farms, feeding on stored grain. The option of wishing the mice on a local enemy, while amusing, suggests a degree of maliciousness that would correspond to witchcraft. The forest ranger, clearly a generous and kind person, declines the offer, thus confirming (a) the degree to which mice could be a threat rather than simply a nuisance and (b) the degree to which neighbors could dislike each other.

     There is a forest ranger's house at the southern border of N&#xF8;rlund forest, at a location listed on maps as Trads--Tang Kristensen likely misheard Jens, and wrote Kras.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories of a cunning woman ridding the country of wolves are widely attested (DS VII 690, 696, 700). In some stories, the woman does the service to escape punishment for witchcraft (JPP 4.16). The prohibition on calling the wolves by their true name connects the wolves to Satan and other supernatural beings. The common expression, "speak of the devil" continues with, "and he's in the room"--given that the devil often kills people in the same room as him, it would be unwise to name him by name (BJK 1.15). This belief also accounts for the various nicknames given the devil, most prominent among them, Old Erik (BJK 1.23).

     Jens adds a coda to the story, remarking that he is unsure of whether the wolves drowned or went to Sweden. This coda is amusing in light of the previous story of conjuring the mice onto one's enemies, and the bad blood between Denmark and Sweden in the aftermath of the wars of 1814 and 1867. Tang Kristensen deleted Jens's evaluative comment, "Wasn't that strange," from the published version. Given the performance context, this evaluative meta-comment adds a certain humor to the story.</annotation>

    <annotation>The man in Gandrup in Jens's story is clearly a witch, and not a cunning person. Many of Jens's other stories probe the thin line separating witchcraft and cunning. But cursing people and, in this instance, presumably cursing their animals, would certainly qualify as malicious under the ordinances of the Danish Law of 1683. It is not surprising, then, that the man in Gandrup is in league with the devil. As in most stories that include a pact with the devil, the devil always try to collect, with gruesome results. 

     The use of a horse's head to prevent the witching is an unusual remedy, although it might be that using a horse's head in some way mimicked the outcome of the curse--an example of inverse sympathetic magic. Rye bread as a prophylaxis against the devil is not widely attested and somewhat difficult to decipher. 

     Tang Kristensen made several inexplicable changes to the manuscript that suggest that the man had bewitched the farm where he lived--a detail that is not in the manuscript, and changes the locus of threat from the outside community to inside the house itself.</annotation>

They hung a horse's head up in their own chimney and as long as it hung there, he got no peace or quiet, except when he lay with a rye bread on his chest. Never any peace. The others did it to him and hung it there where he bewitched them. Up in the smoke. He lay in his bed for several years. He lay there with that rye bread and held on to it so the devil couldn't come and squeeze him.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The cunning man emerges as far more competent in this story than he does in many of Jens's other stories. The man's apparent pact with the devil, despite his poverty, guarantees that Satan will arrive in some form or other; here he takes on the characteristic dog form (Woods 1959). Ironically, it is one of the witch masters whom Jens Yvsten (normalized in the published version to Justesen) rails against that cures him of his apparent Satanic affliction. In the published version, Tang Kristensen eliminated the opening line of the manuscript  that sets up this juxtaposition.

     Stopping the clock as part of the cure is related to stories of tricking the devil. Here, the devil is supposed to come and get the man on the stroke of a specific time--by stopping the clock, the devil is tricked out of his due, and the man can be cured. Jens suggests that the man's subsequent demeanor, particularly that he stops swearing, is strange, implying that swearing was par for the course among farmers and rural workers.

     In his coda, Jens adds some local historical detail about the razing of Skjelhusene (Boundary Houses) that does not appear in the published version. Skjelhusene are shown on early maps several hundred meters to the east of Mylenbj&#xE6;rg, next to the forest ranger's house. Mylenberg is six kilometers south of Ersted.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>An old man walked around, yelling and swearing that the devil should come and take these here witch masters. Then one night, his wife was sitting milking, and a shaggy dog came and climbed up a wagon shaft and went up and finally sat down by their chimney out on the roof.

The man got better, but he got so strange from this that he never swore again. The devil was supposed to get him at a specific time.

    <annotation>Stories about people getting magical powers after ingesting special snakes are widely attested, as are stories about the unusual white viper king (DS II E 158). Stories of the viper king overlap with those of lindorm, and some stories attest to their close connection (DS II E 160). 

     Given the potential economic windfall from being able to see into calves' bellies, it is no wonder that the horse dealer wanted the powers related to eating the viper king. In Danish legends, the horse dealer is either a dangerous character, connected to corruption and manipulation, or a perfect victim, wandering about with scads of cash (JPP 2.01). Amusingly, in this story, the young girl accidentally eats the soup. Other variants note that it is the first person who tastes the soup, particularly the fat floating on the surface, who gains the supernatural benefit (DS II E 163). In some instances, the person who eats the soup is described as becoming "urimelig klog" [unusually wise] (DS II E 163). 

     The horse dealer's attempt to buy the girl confirms his callous nature and also his desperation. The girl's parents (or guardians) would of course reap the windfall from her new found powers.</annotation>

    <annotation>In the folktale index, this story is cataloged as ATU 1875, "The Boy on the Bear's (Wolf's) Tail." Here, the fox substitutes for the wolf. The story's orientation is similar to that of the story of the leather reins (BJK 1.19), and presents a fairly normal situation. As the narrative progresses, the episodes become increasingly unusual. While catching the boy stealing apples constitutes a fairly normal complicating action, the proposed punishment is unusually harsh. The actual punishment is slightly less harsh. The resolution of the story situates it in the realm of the tall tale. 

         Jens refers to this story later on in his third session with Tang Kristensen, but either did not tell the whole story or Tang Kristensen only made short annotations because he had collected the story before (BJK 3.10). The story is cataloged in the folktale fair copy collection as &#xC6;v 1247b, "Nattelogiet" [Night lodgings].</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>It was while Kro-Niels in Tveden was a little boy, he was supposed to lead a horse to Nibe that his father had sold to man up from Gj&#xF8;l. 5 Daler for it. It took so long for the man to show up, it was almost night. He didn't dare go home and so he wandered about and didn't know where he was going to spend the night. He comes back to the same place again where he was supposed to deliver the horse and their back door out to the garden is open. He goes in there and up the stairs. There were so many apples and he wanted some so he started eating as much as he could, he starts to get a little picky and so he started feeling around for the softest and best ones. This was over the man and woman's bed. She had gone to bed but the man hadn't yet, it was a pub, and the guests hadn't left yet. The woman hears this and she says to the man that there were thieves in the attic. He gets someone to come along with him and he lights a lamp and finds Kro-Niels in the apples and drags him down to the main room. They should do something to him for doing that. They could take the money for the horse from him. No, that would be a shame, says the woman, then his father would break his back when he comes home. Can't we figure out something else to do to him? Sure, the man came up with something, they had a fox cage out in the back yard, he'd put him in there until the morning. Stuffs him into that and closes it. Well later that night the fox came and ran about and sniffed the fox cage and he could smell something. There were bars on one end and he reaches out his arm and gets hold of the fox's tail. It runs off with him and he continues to hold on. After a while, the cage broke apart, he was totally lost and had no idea where he was. So he stood there and looked around, he was on top of R&#xE6;vild Kold, and then he could see his house. He walks home.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Imens Kro-Niels var en bitte dreng, skulde han tr&#xE6;kke til Nibe med en hest, hans fader havde solgt til en mand oppe fra Gj&#xF8;l, og han skulde have 5 daler for den. Han kommer til Nibe, men det blev n&#xE6;sten aften, inden manden kommer og tager imod hesten. S&#xE5; blev det m&#xF8;rkt, og han turde ikke g&#xE5; hjem, hvorfor han gik og daskede omkring en lidt. Nu vidste han jo ikke, hvor han skulde v&#xE6;re om natten, og s&#xE5; kommer han til det samme sted igjen, hvor han skulde levere hesten, det var i et v&#xE6;rtshus, og der stod bagd&#xF8;ren &#xE5;ben. Den f&#xF8;rte ud i haven. Han kommer ind ad d&#xF8;ren og g&#xE5;r op ad en trappe. Der l&#xE5; en hel m&#xE6;ngde &#xE6;bler oppe p&#xE5; loftet, og dem vilde han gj&#xE6;rne have, han var jo og bleven noget sulten, og s&#xE5; gav han sig til at &#xE6;de det bedste han kunde. Men efterh&#xE5;nds blev han jo noget nuedens (w&#xE5;nend) og l&#xE5; og ragte i dem og f&#xF8;lte efter, hvad for nogle der var bl&#xF8;dest og gj&#xE6;vest. Det traf sig nu netop at v&#xE6;re oven over mandens og konens seng, konen var allerede kommen i seng, men manden var ikke, for de fremmede var ikke g&#xE5;ede endnu. Konen h&#xF8;rer s&#xE5;, det skrasler p&#xE5; loftet, og siger til manden, at der vist nok var tyve der oppe. Han far lys i lygten og f&#xE5;r en til at f&#xF8;lge med sig derop. De finder Kro-Niels i &#xE6;blerne og tr&#xE6;kker ham med dem ned i stuen. Nu skulde de jo have &#xE9;n ting h&#xE6;ws p&#xE5; ham for det. De snakker sammen om, at de kunde jo tage pengene fra ham for hesten. "Nej", siger konen, "det er synd, s&#xE5; sl&#xE5;r faderen vel ryggen i stykker p&#xE5; ham, n&#xE5;r han kommer hjem. Kan vi ikke hitte p&#xE5; &#xE9;n ting andet at gj&#xF8;re ved ham?" Jo, s&#xE5; kom manden efter, at de havde en r&#xE6;vekiste, der l&#xE5; ude i haven, den vilde de s&#xE6;tte ham i til om morgenen. De f&#xE5;r ham derind og lukker for ham. N&#xE5;, s&#xE5; hen ad natten s&#xE5; kom r&#xE6;ven, og den rendte og snyssiede omkring kisten og kunde lugte noget. Nu var der st&#xE6;nger for den ene ende, og der r&#xE6;kker Kro-Niels armen ud og f&#xE5;r fat i halen af r&#xE6;ven. Den render med ham, og han bliver ved at holde i halen. S&#xE5; gik kisten i stykker omsider, og han kommer ud. Men han var helt vildt og vidste aldrig, hvor han var. Som han nu stod og s&#xE5; sig omkring, blev han klog p&#xE5;, at han stod ovenp&#xE5; R&#xE6;vild Kold, og derfra, kunde han se hjem. Alts&#xE5; spaserer han af hjem til faderen med pengene og var kommen godt nok fra den tur.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Once while Kro-Niels in Tveden was still a little boy, he was supposed to lead a horse to Nibe that his father had sold to man up from Gj&#xF8;l, and he was to have five daler for it. He gets to Nibe, but it is almost night before the man comes to receive the horse. Then it got dark and he didn&#x2019;t dare go home, and so he wandered about a bit. Now he didn&#x2019;t know where he was going to spend the night, and he comes back to the same place again where he was supposed to deliver the horse, it was a pub, and their back door was open. It led out to the garden. He goes in through the door and up some stairs. There were lots of apples up there in the attic, and he wanted some because he had gotten sort of hungry, and so he started eating as much as he could. After a while, he starts to get a little picky and so he started feeling around for the softest and best ones. It turned out that this was directly over the man and woman&#x2019;s bed, she had already gone to bed, but the man hadn&#x2019;t yet, since the customers hadn&#x2019;t left yet. The woman hears a scratching up in the attic and she says to her husband that there were probably thieves up there. He lights a lamp and gets someone to come along with him up there. They find Kro-Niels in the apples and drag him down with them to the main room. They should do something to him for doing that. They discuss taking the money for the horse from him. &#x201C;No, that would be a shame,&#x201D; says the woman, &#x201C;then his father would break his back when he gets home. Can&#x2019;t we figure out something else to do to him?&#x201D; Sure, the man came up with something, they had a fox cage out in the back yard, they&#x2019;d put him in there until morning. They get him in there and close it. Well, later that night, the fox came and ran about and sniffed the fox cage and he could smell something. Now, there were bars on one end and Niels reaches out his arm there and gets a hold of the fox&#x2019;s tail. It runs off with him and he continues to hold on. After a while, the cage broke apart, and he got out. But he was totally lost and had no idea where he was. While he stood there and looked around, he realized that he was on top of R&#xE6;vild Kold, and he could see his house from there. So he walks on home with the money for his father, and the trip had turned out pretty well after all.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The use of magical books is widely attested in Danish tradition. Usually the books are identified as the Cyprianus, the anti-bible, related more to the devil than to the Christian god. Many cunning folk mixed faith healing and evangelical Christian practice with their cures (R&#xF8;rbye 1976a; R&#xF8;bye 1976b), and wise ministers clearly relied primarily on the bible for their magical power. The premise "the older, the better," or in this case, "the older, the more powerful" informs this story, as does an interesting notion of contagious magic. Since this bible was ostensibly written at the time when two of the most powerful figures in Christianity were alive, the book is closer to the "source," and thereby more powerful than a normal bible. It is also interesting that the woman uses her bible to curse a woman, but of course that woman had also broken the sixth and tenth commandments. Tang Kristensen eliminates this reference to reading a curse on the Bible in the published version of the story.</annotation>

    <annotation>This long humorous ballad explores in remarkable detail the pettiness of local squabbles and politics. The bailiff is shown to be corrupt, and the gossip is shown to be remarkably persistent in her efforts to demean the farmer. The farmer rises to her challenge, and threatens a lawsuit for defamation. This type of litigation for libel was a recent development for the common person in the late nineteenth century; references to local newspapers, which did not become broadly available until the 1870s, further suggest that the ballad was of fairly recent origin. 

     In a short annotation, Tang Kristensen wrote: "'Den onde Birte' [The evil Birte] is well known throughout the country and is quite recent. The rhyme scheme suggests this as well. It is found in Svend Grundtvig's collections and fragments of it have often been told to me." Oddly, the variant that Tang Kristensen published, and attributed to Jens, diverged significantly from the manuscript recording. It is possible that the printed version came from a separate collection--perhaps even a ballad collected by Hjort. If that is the case, then it is unclear why Tang Kristensen did not publish the amusing ballad that Jens sang here.</annotation>
    <danish_manuscript>En Bondemand var haardt belagt alt med en Sladder

</danish_manuscript>
    <english_manuscript>A farmer was hard pressed
all by a gossipy woman
the sharpest in the whole town
and in the area that one could find

Everyone she saw she offered her tale
and the man heard about it
he often got mad about that
but what on earth could he do?

Avert it was his intention
but he couldn&#x2019;t manage to do it, 
at last he became so deaf and dumb
that he couldn&#x2019;t hear it

About the woman&#x2019;s husband 
he read out the worst notices
Mockery and defamation
he wrote that in newspapers

Worries by the thousand came
From that woman 
that&#x2019;s why he finally asked her husband
to lock her up

When her friends saw that
what words had been written
it cut them to their hearts
so their anger got fired up

No, she should have free permission
to see whatever she wants
Does he think he can forbid that
Where does he think he&#x2019;s going that coward?

They all judged him for what he had done
but the woman&#x2019;s husband 
didn&#x2019;t find out
about whom the piece had been written

Therefore they wrote a holy ballad
to make each woman clean
that man who wants to honor his wife
his name he should add to it

They sent for the district bailiff
and they had the husband summoned 
he must come to arbitration
and they named the woman&#x2019;s name

The district bailiff speaks to him
you&#x2019;ve spoken ill of her
she wants two hundred daler
and so her honor back

Two hundred daler, he said,
is not so easy to get (win),
that I should send them off to
a gossipy woman like that.

But to that her husband answered
I can&#x2019;t shame you
two hundred daler she wants
even if you have to borrow them

He said, no I can&#x2019;t do that
and I won&#x2019;t do it
but if you want, 
go ahead and sue me

To the law her husband now turned
he said here is money
it probably won&#x2019;t be long
before you&#x2019;ll need my help

Yes, I have all the big men,
and their wives as well,
it won&#x2019;t be easy for you
to win a case against me.

We&#x2019;ll tear your honor down,
we&#x2019;ll get rid of your courage
you&#x2019;ll have to pay out your money
and we&#x2019;ll send you out of the country

He answered that, &#x201C;big words
knock no man from his horse,&#x201D;
to carry it out is not so easy,
that&#x2019;s what I think by the way

And so like that the arbitration ended
they both had to head home
that day the town's women were cleaned
only one was left standing

Now time passes
and Fastelavn (Shrovetide) comes
they decide to have a dance
for the youngsters in the town

When the gossip woman found out
she quickly regrets it
and she tries with cunning and power
to prevent it

To the bailiff now went her message
if you will yield to me in this
then I will never forget 
what you have endured for me

I intend my opponent&#x2019;s dance
to turn to nothing
but even with all my power
I can&#x2019;t do that myself.

But you can make things happen,
I know that for a fact,
that one needs a man 
who can piss up against the wall

And if you&#x2019;ll do this, my good Man
and help me to do this
I will certainly sing your praises
until you die

He meets up with three strong men
to order the others about
but it wasn&#x2019;t within his power
they decided to fix him 

He came with many big words
they didn&#x2019;t want to listen
he tried to get them on their way
but he couldn&#x2019;t do it.

When he&#x2019;d finished his speech
he came up to the door
then he said, you scoundrels
I&#x2019;m coming in here

You won&#x2019;t listen to my words
and you want to fix
but if you want to
than you I&#x2019;ll soon arrest

But the host said: You good men
I would regret that
that you want to leave my house 
and not enjoy anything there

He serves them up each a punch
would you please
drink this punch
it would honor me and these people

Yes, the bailiff said he would,
we&#x2019;ll do what you want us to
as long as there isn&#x2019;t anything in it
that would destroy our hearts

He said no, my dear man
don&#x2019;t think that I am so evil
that I would pour you poison
so that you&#x2019;d lose your lives

They quietly drank the pitcher out
and they licked about their lips
they didn&#x2019;t say thank you
but took off out the door

They went off to the gossip-woman
who was waiting at home and listens
how it was going at the dance
and if they could forbid it.

I thought that I would report to you
something quite happy
but they were far too courageous
I couldn&#x2019;t force them

A fart (party?) slips away from me
and my anger grows
what a man has in his hand
is not so easy to take away

And so in her anger she wrote
a letter to the district bailiff
how those guys had with the dance 
made a fool of him

But it&#x2019;s probably true
that they didn&#x2019;t know what they were doing
call them into you so
and let them hear the law

Don&#x2019;t be late and let them know
what is written there
and then let them pay a fine
for what they&#x2019;ve done

Those days went so quickly by
they were to meet before the court
each one was dispirited
and from fear their cheeks were red.

    <danish_publication>Den onde Birte.
Er meget bekjendt omkring i landet og er ligesom foreg&#xE5;ende nok temmelig ny. Rimene tyder ogs&#xE5; derp&#xE5;. Den findes i S. Gr.s samlinger og er tit bleven foresagt mig i mindre brudstykker.

1. En bondemand var h&#xE5;rdt belagt med en forbandet kvinde, 
hun gav ham hug og liden mad, ti fik han udi sinde.

2. At vende al sin flid og konst sin Birte at formilde, 
men dette altid var omsonst, hun lamenterte ilde.

3. Han drog til kj&#xF6;bst&#xE6;d, kj&#xF6;bte der smukt sirts til skj&#xF6;rt og tr&#xF6;je, 
han t&#xE6;nkte s&#xE5;, den bandsat m&#xE6;r sit hj&#xE6;rte skulde f&#xF6;je.

4. Men Birte stedse Birte blev, det sirts ej hj&#xE6;lpe kunde, 
hun manden ud af huset drev, elendig var den bonde.

5. En dag han uformodentlig slog t&#xE5;en af en gryde,
hun sprang fra rokken vredelig og mon ham kj&#xE6;ppen byde.

6. Han var ej sen, greb kj&#xE6;ppen fat, og hende leksien l&#xE6;rte, 
s&#xE5; hun ej sov den hele nat for pine, ve og sm&#xE6;rte.

7. Mon se, s&#xE5; hastig og s&#xE5; snart, som det lod af at svie, hun efter gammel skik og art umulig kunde tie.

8. Da sagde bonden: "Gid du var i Helvede hos Fanden, 
brug der din mund, din slemme m&#xE6;r, og sk&#xE5;n mig for din
banden".

9. Straks Fanden nu for d&#xF6;ren st&#xE5;r, han sagde: 
"Kj&#xE6;re bonde, var det din alvor, som du svor, du mig vild' Birte unde?"

10.   "Ja", sagde han, "tag Birte hen, forsikring vil jeg have, 
at hun ej komme skal igjen, at pine mig og plage".

11    Kontrakt blev skreven, Fanden tog den edderblanded' kvinde, 
til Helvede med hende drog, slap hende l&#xF8;s derinde.

12. Hun straks opvakte klammeri, de dj&#xE6;vle til stor plage, 
der aldrig gik en dag forbi, der blev jo h&#xF8;rt en klage.

13. Ja, der kom bud fra Belsebub til ham, som hend' indbragte, 
han skulde f&#xF8;re Birte ud, hvordan han det end magte.

14. Til bonden lader Fanden st&#xE5; og sp&#xF6;rger, om han vil tage 
Birte igjen, da skuld' han f&#xE5; af guld og rige gaver.

15. Han sendte da to snedig' m&#xE6;nd, som bonden kund' indtage; 
da han kontrakten tog igjen, blev Fanden fri for plage.

16. Nu rygtedes i alle land, hun dj&#xE6;vle kan uddrive,
det h&#xE6;ndte sig, en m&#xE6;gtig mand lod brev til hannem skrive:

17. Min bedste karl er besat, du endelig m&#xE5; komme,
og tjene dig en m&#xE6;gtig skat og r&#xF8;de guld i lommen.

18.   Han tr&#xE6;der ind, men Birte st&#xE5;r bag d&#xF6;ren, 
Fanden sp&#xF6;rger: "Hvem har vel efter dig haft bud, hvad har du her at gj&#xF8;re?"

19. Da sagde han: "Mit &#xE6;rend' er at s&#xE6;lge to par stude, 
men ellers s&#xE5; st&#xE5;r Birte her og venter p&#xE5; dig ude".

20. Ved disse ord f&#xE5;r Fanden skr&#xE6;k: "Hvem har ladt hende st&#xE6;vne?"
S&#xE5; sp&#xF6;rger han, og ta'r straks v&#xE6;k, da han h&#xF8;r' hende n&#xE6;vne.

21. S&#xE5; drog den bonde og Birte hjem med guld og rige gaver, 
men Birtes vilje m&#xE5;tte frem, bonden til tusend' plager.

22. Sp&#xF6;rg du til sidst, hvor Birte kom, som kunde alle skr&#xE6;mme, 
i skj&#xE6;rsild fik hun intet rum, Helved' kan hend' ej gjemme.

23. Nu er hun i den m&#xF8;rke vr&#xE5;, man Helveds forstu' kalder, 
der skal hun som en porthund st&#xE5;, det hende ej gefalder.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>1. A farmer was hard pressed by a damn woman
she hit him and gave him little food, until he went out of his mind

2. He used all his diligence and skill to placate his Birte
but it was all for naught, she continued to complain

3. He went to the market town, he bought beautiful colored fabric for blouses and skirts
he thought that that damn mare would have a change of heart

4. But Birte kept being Birte, that colored fabric couldn&#x2019;t help
she drove her man from the house, that farmer was miserable

5. One day he accidentally broke a toe off of a pot
she jumped angrily up from the spinning wheel, and offered him the whip

6.He wasn&#x2019;t late, he grabbed the whip, and she learned a lesson
so she didn&#x2019;t sleep the whole night because of pain, pain and more pain

7.But see as soon as she started to get better
she went back to her old ways and couldn&#x2019;t keep quiet

8.Then the farmer said: &#x201C;I wish you were in hell with the devil,
use your mouth there, you horrible mare, and spare me your curses

9. Immediately, the devil stood at the door, he said, &#x201C;Dear Farmer,
were you serious when you swore that you wanted me to have Birte?&#x201D;

10. &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;take Birte away, I want some insurance
that she won&#x2019;t come again, to pain and bother me.&#x201D;

11. The contract was written, the devil took the poison-mixed woman
to hell he went with her, and let her go in there

12. She immediately caused a ruckus, she bothered all the devils,
never a day went by when there wasn&#x2019;t a complaint heard

13. Yes, there came a message from Beelzebub to him, who&#x2019;d brought her there,
he was to take Birte away, however it was that he managed it

14. The devil goes off to the farmer and asks him
if he&#x2019;ll take Birte again, then he&#x2019;d get gold and rich gifts

15. He then sent two wily men, whom the farmer could house;
when he took the contract back, the devil was free from bother

16. Now it was rumored in all the land, she could drive out devils,
and so it happened, a powerful man wrote her a letter:

17. My best farmhand is possessed, you must come,
and earn yourself a giant fortune and red gold in your pocket

18. He walks in, but Birte stands behind the door, the devil asks:
&#x201C;Who has sent for you, what are you doing here?&#x201D;

19. Then he said, &#x201C;My errand is to sell two pair oxen,
but otherwise Birthe is standing waiting for you out here.&#x201D;

20. With these words, the devil got scared: &#x201C;Who called for her?&#x201D;
That&#x2019;s what he asks, and immediately leaves, when he hears her name.

21. Then that farmer and Birte went home with gold and rich gifts,
but Birte&#x2019;s will had to come out, and bothered the farmer 1000 times

22. If you ask, where Birte finally ended up, the one who could scare everyone,
there was no room for her in purgatory, hell cannot hide her.

23. Now she is in the dark nook that you call the anteroom to hell,
there she is to stand as a watchdog, she does not like it.

    <annotation>Although revenants driving carriages and wagons are not uncommon, usually the driver is a man, not a woman. It is unclear what a "half wagon" is, although it is most likely a short bed wagon. The farmhand and the hired girl's discussion about having sex in the back of the wagon results in the sudden and frightening attack on their dog. The girl and the boy have clearly opened themselves, the farm and the long-term fertility of the community to extraordinary threat. Per Ingvarsen's decision to use Christian icons and sharpened metal to beat back the threat is effective.</annotation>

Then one night Per Ingvarsen's hired girl said to his farmhand that now she wanted him to lay with her in the half wagon tonight, and so they stood talking to each other about this.

    <annotation>Stories of Odin's hunter and the night raven are widely attested (JPP 2.19). In this story, both creatures cause a slight disruption. The night raven is the more threatening supernatural creature in the second of these two short accounts. The farmhand's mimicking of the night raven is related to stories in which individuals inadvertently call the devil to them with disastrous results. Here, the farmhand gets a scare and the night raven gets a local nickname. It also resonates with the farmhand and hired girl's teasing of the revenant in the previous story (BJK 2.06).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>The Wolravens came into being if, during a battle, they didn't find the king or chieftain and bury him, and then ravens came and ate part of him, these would become Valravens, and the one that ate his heart got the knowledge of a human and could do evil and twist (bewitch) people and they were really frightening animals and they also had supernatural powers.</english_manuscript>

      Det var en gang i Gravlev kro, der var s&#xE5; mange unge forsamlede. S&#xE5; var der &#xE9;n, der hed Jokum, han skj&#xE6;ft efter natravnen og sagde ba-u ligesom den. Men s&#xE5; kom den efter dem ude p&#xE5; gaden, og de sprang jo ind i kroeret og vilde hytte dem. Jokum havde sagt: "Hvad er det for en gut, der siger ba-u?" og siden kaldte de den s&#xE5; Jokums gut.

    <english_publication>A man had driven a load of heather over here, which they&#x2019;d gathered over in the hills. When they were going to carry it in at night, the night raven came and scared my mother, and she ran inside defenseless. 
     One time over at Gravlev Inn, a large group of youngsters had gathered. Then there was one called Jokum, he called for the night raven and said &#x201C;ba-u&#x201D; just like it. But then it came after them out on the street, and they ran into the inn and wanted to hide. Jokum had said, &#x201C;What kind of a guy says ba-u?&#x201D; and after that they&#x2019;d called it Jokum&#x2019;s guy. Well, then the night raven flew away again, but Jokum didn&#x2019;t dare come out of the inn, he was the last one there that night.

    <annotation>One of the recurring complaints of hired hands on Danish farms during the late nineteenth century was the unreasonable demand on time that their employers placed on them. Foremost among these complaints was that employers did not allow them to attend family celebrations. The girl's suicide is an extreme example of the anguish caused by restrictive employment contracts.

    Committing suicide was deeply taboo, and the bodies of suicides were not buried in the church cemetery. At the same time, suicides often came back as haunts. The villagers in this story engage a strategy aimed at preventing the girl from haunting to little avail, since the girl returns as the night raven, mentioned in the previous story.

     Using oxen to pull the cart with the girl's body to find her burial place is reminiscent of the oxen that are used to pull building materials to the site of a church (Str&#xF6;mb&#xE4;ck 1958). That the oxen in this case bring her to the churchyard indicates her virtue, an interpretation confirmed in the story by the minister's evaluative comment. The girl is finally buried in a liminal place, literally between Heaven and Hell (Heaven and Hell as place names for farms occur in other stories as well, cf. PJ 1.02).

      "Stor t&#xF8;s" has been translated as "little girl" to avoid awkward translations such as "big lass."</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was this little girl who had to tend the sheep on her sister's wedding day. She threw herself into the hole, the one they call the Cat's well, down in Gravlev fen. Then she was fished out again. When they were going to bury her, they hitched a couple of oxen to her, and then they had to see where they stopped, that's where she was to be buried. They went and opened the churchyard gate and if the oxen decided to go in there with her then she could be buried in the churchyard. They went up to the church gates too but they just stood there. Then the minister said, "Her soul was that close to heaven, but it couldn't come in." They turned the oxen around and shooed them along. Then they went and stopped up where Jens Binderup's farm is now, it's called H&#xE6;gledi.

    <annotation>The story of the elf hunter, often referred to as Odin's hunter, is widely attested in Danish and European traditions (JPP 2.19). The motif is often referred to as the "Wild Hunt," and is cataloged by Christiansen as ML5060 (Lindow 2000, 1036-1037). Jens adds an amusing element to his story, with the hunter's unusual way of cleaning himself. In another variant, the elves suggest that he cannot catch them because he has lice (DS II C 91). Using urine to combat lice may well have been a folk remedy.

     The man who takes his fingers out of his ears is analogous to the farmhand or coachman who tries to witness the conjuring of a ghost, nearly causing the conjuring to fail (DS V 728). Here, the hunter is forced to chase the elf hags much further afield than he had intended. The payment the man receives for his assistance, despite its seeming banality, turns out to be extraordinary. This unusually high payment for services clearly parallels the payment the midwife to the mound dwellers receives for her help (1.11).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Jens J&#xE6;ger came riding one time. A man came walking from Ersted to &#xC5;restrup and two elf women came running quickly towards him, and they came in on the south side of the town and said to each other, "He won't catch us yet, because he isn't clean." Well, the man continued to walk on his way along the road. Then someone came riding up to him. Then the one who is riding says to him, "Did any one come the other way?"--"Yes, these two little ones came by running as fast as they could." -- "What did they say to each other?" he asked. "They said: he won't catch us yet, because he isn't clean." Then he pissed in his hand and wiped himself with it, and then he said to the man, "If you'll lie down and stick your fingers in your ears, I'll pay you well when I come back in a little bit." He did that too. But then he thought that it was taking quite a while and he wanted to take his fingers out of his ears. First he took one finger out, and he heard a shot but he thought it might be over by Hobro. Well, he lies down again for a little while. But then he got bored lying there, and he gets up and takes his fingers out. Then he hears another shot. That was as far away as Horsens. Well, then he puts his fingers back in his ears and he lies down again. Then he comes back with both of them, and they were tied together by their hair and they were hanging over the horse each on a side. Then he says, "You'll be paid well for this, but it could have been better; you took your fingers out of your ears." That had hindered him and he had had to ride from Hobro to Horsens to catch the last one. But his horse had lost a shoe along the way, and he could go and get it, then he'd have ample payment, since it turned out to be a gold shoe when the man got out there and found it.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The motif of dogs accompanying the wild hunter is widely attested, although mention of puppies is less frequent, probably because puppies are not that suited to hunting. The wild hunter's dogs are usually red; that the hunter is described as green (and not wearing green clothes) is unusual. The puppies are cute, drinking the farm wife's wort, and eating her bread, but they also compromise her work in the kitchen for the day. In some variants, the hunter compensates the woman for her loss in a manner analogous to the compensation that the midwife to the fairies receives (DS II C 68). 

     Houses generally did not have doors on either end; instead, doors were likely to be staggered along the lengths of the building.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens's story is an elaborate variant of the widely attested story of the witch riding a farmhand to the Witch's Sabbath (DS VII 443). The farmhand appeals to a local cunning man, and the advice he receives is sound. In the resolution, the witch is revealed to be the dean's wife. 

     The implicit connection in this story between the dean and Satan can be interpreted in several ways. On the one hand, that the dean is married to a witch suggests a profound degree of corruption and hypocrisy in the high church officer's own home. On the other hand, the marriage to the well-concealed witch--and by extension the devil--may suggest that this Satanic threat has reached the innermost circle of the church undetected, and thus threatens the very foundations of the community.

      The boy's symptoms are similar to those of people who have been ridden by the mare; the witch's ride is an analogous phenomenon (KMP 1.37; DS II F 90, 93-95). In this story, the boy, transformed into a horse, is able to turn the tables on the witch, and have her shod before revealing her identity. Revealing the identity of the witch often included public humiliation (JPP 1.05).

      Troms cathedral in Norway was the Danish tradition dominant for the location of the witches' sabbath. Bloksbj&#xE6;rg, a mountain in an unspecified, yet distant location, is also widely attested as the location of this gathering (DS VII 335 and 336). Both Voldborg (Valborg) eve (May 1), and St. Hans eve (June 23) are widely attested as the night that the witches ride to Troms&#xF8;.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was one from Jens Adals family, a witch rode on him to Troms church, it was the dean's wife from Smoddup (Ravnkilde parish). Then he talked to a witch master about this, he didn't know what to do. It had come one night and ridden him and he'd thought that he was a horse and he'd gone past both Aalborg and Sundby and was so far away that he didn't know how far it was. Well, he'd give him some good advice for that. It was probably Skt. Hans eve but I think they also ride on Voldborg eve. Then he says to him, "When it's Voldborg eve, you mustn't fall asleep. She'll come again." He got sick from that, and he got something from the witch master to get better. Well, then on Voldborg eve she came again, and he's lying there wide awake, and she comes and puts a bridle on him. The witchmaster had told him what would happen. When he got to Troms church and she'd tied him up or let him loose, I can't remember what it was she did, he was supposed to push the bridle off and when she came out again, he was supposed to put it on her, then she'd turn into a horse and then he was to get up and ride on her. Well, she did what the witch master said she would and she rode on him all the way to Trom's church and went in along with the others and they were many. Then he stands there and pushes the bridle off and when she came out and was going to ride home on him he put the bridle on her and she turned into a horse and he rode home to where he came from. When day broke, he rode to Store-Arden and had her shod both front and back. When that was done, he took the bridle off of her and it was the dean's wife, she stood there shaking them. Then one time when he went to Brorstrup church to see her, and he thanked her for their last meeting.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The improper use of the witch's rake or broom is widely attested in Scandinavian tradition, and Christiansen catalogs these stories as ML3045, "Following the witch." In Jens's story, it is a beggar who has received quarter in the farm who witlessly tries to mimic the witch's ride. In other variants, it is a hired girl (DS VII 436) or a farmhand (DS VII 435). The witch's formula is a key element in the story, and numerous variants of the formula exist. The unwitting rider always makes an amusing substitution in directional adverbs. Jens adds the substitution of the unlikely destination of Hasseris, a town just west of Aalborg. These stories often have a humorous, rather than tragic, ending.</annotation>

    <annotation>Werewolves, in both of the stories published as a single record, pose a fairly obvious threat to the fertility of the community, being intimately linked in the first story to childbirth and, in the second story, to a couple clearly at the start of a relationship that will likely lead to child rearing. The werewolf is also a threat to the physical well-being of the insiders. In some accounts, the only way a werewolf can become free of the curse is to eat the heart of an unborn child, solidifying the werewolf's role as a threat to fertility (DS II F 2).

     The werewolf in the first of Jens's stories is unusual, since werewolves are predominantly men. Women were said to perform the described ritual, usually involving a horse placenta rather than a horse hide, to avoid the pains of childbirth (DS II F 1). If the child was a boy, he would become a werewolf, and if the child a girl, she would become a mare. The horse's placenta offers a direct connection (contagious magic) to the riding of the mare, while the goal of an easy of childbirth--"as easy as a horse giving birth" (DS II F 4)--is related to the mimicking of childbirth in the action of passing through the placenta (sympathetic magic). The ritual is also reminiscent of the failed blood-brotherhood ritual described in G&#xED;sla saga, where a piece of sod is raised on poles for the intended brothers to pass underneath. 

      The second story, a variant of a widely attested story of recognizing the werewolf and thereby eliminating the curse, includes the more common male werewolf. Threads or pieces of cloth caught in the farmhand's teeth are the most common tokens revealing his identity as a werewolf (DS II F 18).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>My father told that there were once two hags who pulled off their clothes and climbed through a horse skin they'd hung up on a pole and they were pregnant. They were naked and then their babies became werewolves. They were human most of the time. They'd tear apart the first thing they encountered regardless of what it was. Then there was a farmhand here in the area who was out driving on the heath to gather heather with a girl and they were boyfriend and girlfriend. Then they get to a dale or a low place out there on the heath, the farmhand gets down and says to the girl: "If a wolf comes up to you, don't stick it with the pitchfork." -- "Well, what should I do with it then?" Well, she could pull her apron off and hit it with that. As soon as he'd gone, a wolf comes up to her, and it wanted to jump on her. But she grabbed her apron and hit it. It snapped at the apron and tore it into tiny pieces, and then it ran away, and once the wolf had disappeared the farmhand came back. "A wolf was just here... you were gone for so long." He laughed a bit about that. It was a blue apron with some white stripes. When the farmhand began to laugh, she could see the threads between his teeth. "It was you because I can see the threads between your teeth." Then he never became a werewolf again, because now he'd been revealed.</english_manuscript>

Ja, hun kunde h&#xE6;gte hendes forkl&#xE6;de af og sl&#xE5; den i det. Straks han var heng&#xE5;et, kommer der ogs&#xE5; en ulv til hende, og den vilde have sprunget p&#xE5; hende. Men hun greb forkl&#xE6;det og slog efter den. Den snappede det og splittede i ene sm&#xE5; stumper, og s&#xE5; rendte den sin vej. Lidt efter kom karlen igjen. "Der har v&#xE6;ret en ulv her og villet splitte mig &#xE6;d, og du biede s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge." Han lo noget &#xE6;d det. Hendes forkl&#xE6;de var bl&#xE5;t med nogle hvide striber i. Den gang karlen nu gav sig til at le, kunde hun se tr&#xE5;dene imellem hans t&#xE6;nd. "Det var jo dig," siger hun, "for a kan se tr&#xE6;vlerne imellem dine t&#xE6;nd." S&#xE5; blev han aldrig til varulv mere, for nu var han r&#xF8;bet.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>My father told a story that there were once two hags who pulled off their clothes and climbed through a horse hide they&#x2019;d hung up on a pole. They were pregnant and they were naked and then their babies became werewolves. But they were people most of the time. When they were wolves, they&#x2019;d tear apart the first thing they encountered regardless of what it was. A farmhand at home here was out driving on the heath with a girl and they were boyfriend and girlfriend. When they got to a dale or a low place out there on the heath, the farmhand gets down and says to the girl: &#x201C;If a wolf comes up to you, don&#x2019;t stick it with the pitchfork.&#x201D; -- &#x201C;Well, what should I do with it then?&#x201D; Well, she could pull off her apron and hit it with that. As soon as he&#x2019;d gone, a wolf comes up to her and it wanted to jump on her. But she grabbed her apron and hit it. It snapped at it and tore it into tiny pieces, and then it ran away. A little later, the farmhand comes back. &#x201C;A wolf was just here and wanted to tear me apart, and you were gone for so long.&#x201D; He laughed a bit about that. Her apron was blue with some white stripes. When the farmhand began to laugh, she could see the threads between his teeth. &#x201C;It was you,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;because I can see the threads between your teeth.&#x201D; Then he never became a werewolf again, because now he&#x2019;d been revealed.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen did not publish this short summary. Instead he incorporated it into the end of an earlier telling of the same story (BJK 1.15). Jens's remarks do not summarize the story, but rather add some additional detail. It is possible that Jens retold the story, and Tang Kristensen only decided to record this information; or it could be that Jens simply added this information in response to a query about that earlier story.  Since it is the first story told in this third collecting session, it may be that Jens had remembered something that he wanted to make sure to tell Tang Kristensen.</annotation>

    <annotation>Getting a ride from the devil is widely attested in Scandinavian legend tradition (ML3025). According to Christiansen, the devil often reveals his real errand to his traveling companion, and asks that he not reveal it (1992, 35-8). The devil's errand in this case is to assist in an infanticide. More often, the devil is on an errand to collect a soul owed him for a previously sworn pact. Stories of averted infanticide are also common (DS VI 427). The devil, tricked by the girl's swell of maternal feelings for her intended victim, regrets having helped her during childbirth.  

    Tang Kristensen eliminates the coda that appears in the manuscript, attributing the story to Peder B&#xF8;dker. The only other person named B&#xF8;dker who appears in Jens's stories is Anders B&#xF8;dker, a cunning man (BJK 1.35). Sixty Danish miles is roughly equivalent to 280 US miles.</annotation>

    <annotation>Legend tradition often proposes that people whose normal senses are compromised have second sight. In this widely attested story, a deaf mute reacts incongruously to the death of two people (DS II G 266). Whereas in other stories like this one, the devil and angels appear to carry off the soul of the deceased, here the dove represents an ascension into heaven, and the raven a descent into hell. The story relies on the inability of the deaf mute to explain his response. Jens carefully adds that the coachman had not learned sign language. The minister, puzzled by the incongruity of the coachman's reactions, prays and his coachman's speech is miraculously restored.

     Jens's coda, insisting on the truth of the account, is uncharacteristic for him. It may suggest that he doubted many of the other stories he told. Or it may indicate that the account is to him so unbelievable that he has to narratively counteract that, by emphasizing its truth.

     Sign language first made in roads in Denmark when Dr. P. A. Castberg opened his school for the deaf in 1807. By the 1880s, sign language was no longer the preferred method of teaching the deaf in Denmark; instead, the goal was to have the deaf learn to speak. It is unlikely that the development of education for the deaf influences Jens's story in any way.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Kirketorup minister had a mute coachman. They drove once and were supposed to go to Bislev, and the coachman couldn't say anything and hadn't learned any finger language or anything like that as they do now. They were to give the last sacrament to a woman, and she died too, while they were there. The coachman cried for her, because it was terrible, but the minister couldn't understand that, because he thought it was a good death. Then they drove to the parish and this was during the winter and they drove down Ejdrup hill. A man came driving towards them and one of the horses kicks out, and cleaves the man's forehead so he falls backwards out of the sleigh and was dead at once. The coachman laughed so hard over this, and the minister thought that this was strange that he could laugh at that. Then the minister prayed from the pulpit for seven years that his coachman could talk, so he could tell him why he cried when the woman died such a good normal, peaceful death in her bed and laughed when the man died so poorly. Then he said that the raven took her soul, while the dove took his soul, and that's what amused him. This isn't a story, it's a true incident, but it happened a long time ago.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen did not publish this fairytale in any of his collections, a variant of ATU 910b, "The Servants Good Counsels." In the fair copy collection, this story is indexed as "The three pieces of good advice."

    The episodes in the story all have analogs in jocular tales or legend. The first episode is akin to legends about peddlers or other merchants being accosted by robbers in forests, and the second episode is similar to widely attested stories about robbers' dens. The third episode conflates stories of the minister as adulterer and stories of the devil taking guilty people who swear their innocence in court using the name of the devil as part of their oath. The final episode includes the invocation of Christian symbolism to counteract the instructions of the devil. Although the initial opening with vreifiable place name referents suggests that the story is a believable account, the final closing formula confirms that the story is a folktale.</annotation>

siger h. For naar de kom hjem (R&#xF8;verne var
ikke hjemme det var ikke uden de gl. h.
snakkede og spiste med) s. tog de ham af
med Livet. Men der var et Reb som h&#xE6;ngte der, lag mig
binde paa dig og s. hidse[de] dig ned ad
et Vindue. Det gjorde hun og s. gik
h. derfra og kom v&#xE6;k. Der kom h. s. til
at losere i en anden Grd Natten efter
igien. Der gik en gl. Mand i Gaarden.
H. sp&#xF8;rg. om h. kan faa Kvarter. Ja
det kunde h. gj&#xE6;rne. H. kunde gaa ind

Ja, det kunde h. da ikke vide. Jo, da var det
saadan. Ja s. skulde h. arresteres s. M. og der

og kom to M&#xE6;nd til at sidde og passe
paa ham. Men hen ad Natten faldt de
i S&#xF8;vn, men Arrest. sov ikke. S. kom der
en til Vinduet og h. s. til ham: Ja i Mor-
gen skulde h. kj&#xF8;res til Herredsfog og i
Forh&#xF8;r. Men alt det du siger, det tror
de ikke og siger det er L&#xF8;gn. Ham der
havde v&#xE6;ret paa Konen, det var deres Pr&#xE6;st.
Men s. skulde h. sige: Det skal h. vidne

S. s. Karlen, idet h. peger paa Pr&#xE6;sten, at
det var den Person, der kom imod ham med

der gik her uden for, om h. maatte ikke ha-
ve Lov at kalde ad ham. Jo det maatte
h. godt og [Herredsf.] Karlen gaar hen til Vinduet og kalder
og kalder ad ham og sp.
om h. kan v&#xE6;re Vidne til det h. sagde.
H. s. jo til. S. bandte baade Pr. og Konen
Fanden tage sig paa, at det var L&#xF8;gn og s.
tog h. den ene paa Armene og den anden paa

4091b
Nakken og rejste af med dem. S. kunde de se
det var sandt og h. kunde gaa hjem. Da
h. kommer til Hjemmet kjendte Konen ham
jo ikke. H. sp. om h. kunde ikke blive der.
Jo h. kunde gj&#xE6;rne blive, men hu havde
ingen Steder at l&#xE6;gge ham, for hun hav-
de ikke uden en Seng. Ja, h. kunde sidde
paa en Stol om Natten. Da det bliver
sengetid kommer der en ung Person og l&#xE6;g
ger sig ved Konen i Sengen. Hen ad Natten
kommer der en til Vinduet igien og pikker
og siger, Den Person der ligger, har ligget 
med din Kone hver Nat siden du rejst.
og dersom det var mig som dig, s. gik a 
hen og slog Hovedet i Stykker paa ham
eller skar Halsen over paa ham. Ja h.
var ogsaa der henne og vilde have sk&#xE5;ret
Halsen over. Men s. kommer h. i Tanker 
om at l&#xE6;se hans Herrens B&#xF8;n. S. vaagner
Personen og s. Aa Moder a dr&#xF8;mte
min Fader var her hjemme og var her hen

det er 18 Aar siden, a har set ham, h.
er nok d&#xF8;d for l&#xE6;nge siden. S. h&#xF8;rte h. jo det,
var [det] hans S&#xF8;n. S. havde h. ikke stedt de

4092A
Penge ilde, h. gav for det Raad, ellers hav
de h. jo Skaaret Halsen over paa egen
S&#xF8;n. Om Morg. vilde h. have S&#xF8;nnen til 
at gaa hen og hente en P&#xE6;gl til sig. Ja
det gjorde h. ogsaa. S. vilde h. ogsaa have
ham til at drikke den med sig. Men s. 
sagde Moderen: nej det maatte h. ikke,
for ha. skulde hen og [have] i hans Tjeneste
S sagde h. dem hvem h. var og s. skar
h. Hul paa Kagen og der var alle Penge-

    <english_manuscript>A farmhand and a girl worked together in S&#xF8;nder Tranders Heath farms. There was a young husband and a young wife there, and their pensioners had died, and the pensioners' house stood vacant. Then the farmhand seduced the girl and then she asked the husband if she couldn't stay in the pensioner's house and have her child and he was going to drive the cattle down to Holsten. It was in the spring time as was the custom in the old days. The girl and the farmhand got married, and then he set off on his trip. Then she gave birth to a boy, it was [probably] before he set off, because when the child was brought to the church, they had their wedding at the same time. When he now gets up to Holsten and had gotten rid of the cattle, he stayed there and he started working for a man, but he wouldn't pay him until he saw how he well he worked and whether they could get along with each other. Well, that was OK by him. One week after another went by and he didn't offer him anything and the farmhand didn't demand anything, but he got everything that he needed, and he went about as if he was one of their own, and he stayed there for eighteen years. Then he said to the man one day: Tomorrow I'm going to go home and see to my wife and son. What, are you married? Yes, he was. He had started to think about going home. And so they decided to have a happy day together that day, and so they began drinking. Then he'd put all his earnings together and it amounted to 300 daler, that was a lot of money in the old days. Now, if you'll give me 100 daler, I'll give you a piece of advice that will help you, because you've got a long journey ahead of you. He wasn't to take any shortcuts, but follow the actual road. They had a few more drams. If he'd give him another 100 daler, he'd give him another piece of advice. He shouldn't take lodgings there where the fox had built over the crow, he'd run into trouble there. They continued on like that for so long, that he gave him all his money. Don't take lodgings where there's an old man and a young woman, he'd run into trouble there too. There was another piece of advice. Don't do any deeds that he didn't know were good, unless he'd recited [read] the Our Father three times. Then the wife said: Well, now our father wasted your time today, and I'll waste your time tomorrow, I'm going to bake and you're going to get a nice cake for the trip. He got the nice cake and he wasn't to cut into it until he got home, and if his wife was dead, he was to come back and bring the cake back, and he promised that. The first day that he was out traveling, he ran into a peddler [kr&#xE6;mmer] and they came to a forest, and the peddler says there that they should go this way, since it was a bit shorter than the road. He thinks about it a little bit, but then he says no, he wants to follow the road. When the peddler had gone a little way, he began to cry and scream, robbers had come after him. Then he thought to himself, the money he'd spent on the good advice wasn't wasted. Then he came to a lonely place in the forest and it was evening and he goes and asks for lodgings, and he certainly could stay. That evening they ate dinner and there was an old man by the table and he had red hair and a black beard. Then he thought, I'm going to run into trouble here. Then there was a girl who was supposed to show him to his room upstairs, and then she said that she really was sorry for him. Why, he says. Because when they get home (the robbers weren't home except for the old man with whom he'd talked and eaten), then they'd kill him. But there was a rope hanging there, let me tie it around you and then let you down out the window. She did that, and then he walked away from there and got away. Then he found lodgings in another farm the next night. There was an old man there in the farm. He asks him if he could have lodgings. Yes, he certainly could. He could go in to his wife. So he did and someone comes running at him with his pants down around his ankles, and then he saw that there was a young wife, and when he sees this he thinks, I'm going to run into trouble here. Then the old man comes in. Then she says, What kind of a person was it you sent in to me, he wanted to get up on top of me like the Devil. Yes, he couldn't have known that. Well, that's how it was. Yes, well he should be arrested, said the man, and they send for the parish bailiff. [In Torsted, they say T&#xE5;ste, st&#xE5;rk, but here they say T&#xF8;ste, st&#xF8;rk] and two men came to sit and watch over him. But during the night they fell asleep, but the prisoner didn't. Then someone came up to the window and he said to him: Tomorrow he was to be driven to the district bailiff and be tried. But they won't believe anything you say and they'll say it's a lie. The one who was on top of the wife, that was their minister. But then he was to say: He should witness, the one who is walking outside here. You can see me, but the others can't. He was to say it as it was. Then they get to the courthouse and the trial. I'm sure he was there to help the wife, the minister was, and he was also there to witness. Then the farmhand says, while pointing at the minister, that that was the person, who came at him with his pants down around his ankles, and the one who was standing outside would bear witness to that, and could he be allowed to call him. Yes, he may and the farmhand goes over to the window, and calls and calls to him and asks if he could bear witness to that which he said. He said yes. Then the minister and the wife both swore, the Devil may take them, that it was a lie and then he took the one by the arm and the other by the neck and took off with them. When he gets home, his wife didn't recognize him. He asks if he couldn't stay there. Yes, he could certainly stay, but she didn't have any place for him to lie down, since she only had one bed. Yes, he could sit on a stool at night. When it gets to being bedtime, a young person comes and lies down in the bed next to the wife. Some time out into the night, someone comes and raps on the window and says, the person who is lying there has lain with your wife every night since you left., and if I were you, I'd go over and smash his head in or slit his throat. Yes, he also went over there and was going to slit his throat. But then he remembered that he should say the Our Father. Then the person wakes up and says, Oh, mother, I dreamed that my father was here and he was here next to the bed, and wanted to slit my throat. Oh, your father, she said, it's been eighteen years since I last saw him, he's probably been dead for a long time. Then he heard that it was his son. Then he hadn't spent the money poorly for that piece of advice, otherwise he would have slit the throat of his own son. The next morning he wanted his son to go get a pitcher of ale for him. He did it too. Then he also wanted him to drink it with him. But then the mother said, no, he may not, because he was to go to work. Then he told them who he was, and then he cut into the cake and there was all the money and they're living well to this very day. The last time I was there, I got scalded beer on a sausage, the sausage skin is still sitting on my nose.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der tjente en Karl og en Pige sammen i S&#xF8;nder Tranders Hedegaarde, og det var et Par ringe Folk, de var ved. Deres Aft&#xE6;gtsfolk var d&#xF8;de, og Aft&#xE6;gtshuset stod ledigt. Saa gaar Karlen hen og lokker Pigen. Hun gaar da til Manden og fort&#xE6;ller ham, hvordan det var, og sp&#xF8;rger ham, om hun kan ikke faa Lov til at sidde der i Huset og faa Barnet, for hendes Kj&#xE6;reste vilde drive ad Holsten med Stude, og det var jo i Foraarstiden, han skulde afsted, som det nu var Skik i gammel Tid. Det faar hun og Lov til, men Karlen og Pigen blev da gift, inden han rejste. Men Barnet var da f&#xF8;dt forinden, og det var en Dreng, og det var ogsaa i Kirke, for de gjorde Bryllup med det samme. Altsaa rejste han af. Da han nu kommer op ad Holsten og var bleven skilt ved Studene, saa blev han der oppe med det samme og kom til at tjene en Mand der. Han vilde ikke give ham nogen L&#xF8;n, inden han fik at se, hvordan han var, og hvordan de kunde komme afsted med hverandre. Ja, det var denher Studedriver ogsaa godt forn&#xF8;jet med. Der gik en Uge hen efter en anden, og Manden tilb&#xF8;d ham intet, og Karlen forlangte heller intet, men hvad han tr&#xE6;ngte til, det fik han, og saadan blev han ved at gaa der i 18 Aar og gik der som deres egen. Saa siger han til Manden en Dag: &#x201D;I Morgen vil a hjem og se til min Kone og min S&#xF8;n,&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Hvad, er du gift?&#x201D; siger Manden. Ja, han var, og nu var han komme i Tanker om at ville hjem, for han l&#xE6;ngtes. &#x201D;Ja, saa vil vi have os en glad Dag i Dag,&#x201D; siger Manden, og saa satte de dem til at svire. Han havde sanket hans L&#xF8;n sammen, som han vilde give ham, og det var bleven til 300 Daler, det var store Penge i gammel Tid. De sidder saa og snakker og drikker, og saa siger Manden: &#x201D;Du staar en lang Rejse for, og dersom du vil give mig 100 Daler, saa vil a give dig et godt Raad, som du kan have stor Nytte af.&#x201D; Ja, det vilde han godt, og de gj&#xF8;r den Handel. Raadet det var, at han maatte ikke gaa nogen Gjenvej, men skulde f&#xF8;lge den rele Landevej. Saa fik de nogle flere Dramme, og saa siger Manden: &#x201D;Vil du give mig 100 Daler til, saa skal a l&#xE6;re dig nok et godt Raad.&#x201D; Ja, det gik han ind paa. &#x201D;Du maa ikk tage Kvarter, hvor R&#xE6;ven bygger over Ravnen, for der kommer du skidt afsted.&#x201D; Han blev saa ved med ham saa l&#xE6;nge, til han gav ham alle Penge efter, og saa skulde han have et Raad til, og det var, at han ikke maatte tage Kvarter, hvor der var en gammel Mang og en ung Kone, for det kom han ogsaa skidt fra. Og saa vilde han give ham endnu et godt Raad i Tilgift, og det var, at han ikke maatte tage sig nogen Gj&#xE6;rninger for, som han ikke vidste var gode, f&#xF8;rend han havde l&#xE6;st hans Herrens B&#xF8;n tre gange. Saa siger Konen: &#x201D;Ja, nu har vor Faaer t&#xF8;dt dig i Dag, men nu vil a t&#xF8;de dig i Morgen, for a skal til at bage, og saa skal du faa en fin Kage med dig paa Rejsen.&#x201D; Den fine Kage fik han, og Konen sagde til ham, at han maatte ikke skj&#xE6;re Hul paa den, inden han kom hjem, og hvis hans Kone var d&#xF8;d, saa skulde han komme igjen og levere Kagen tilbage. Det lovede han, og saa rejste han. Den f&#xF8;rste Dag han var ude at rejse, da kom han til en Kr&#xE6;mmer og kom til at f&#xF8;lges med ham, for de skulde &#xE9;n vej. Saa kommer de til en Skov, og saa siger Kr&#xE6;mmeren: &#x201D;Her gaar en Vej ind igjennem som er meget n&#xE6;rere end Landevejen.&#x201D; Han bet&#xE6;nker sig en bitte Krumme, men saa siger han nej, han vilde f&#xF8;lge Landevejen. Men Kr&#xE6;mmeren vilde den anden Vej, og saa skiltes de paa det. Da Kr&#xE6;mmeren saa var kommen et bitte Stykke ind i Skoven, saa begynder han at hv&#xE6;lle og skrige, for der var kommen R&#xF8;vere efter ham. Saa t&#xE6;nkte Karlen ved sig selv: &#x201D;Da stedte a ikke de Penge ilde, a gav for det f&#xF8;rste gode Raad.&#x201D; Han kommer saa omsider til et enligt Sted inde i Skoven, og da var det blevet Aften, og han gaar saa dertil og beder om Kvarter. Det kunde han saa meget vel faa. Som de saa sidder og siser N&#xE6;tter om Aftenen, saa sidder der en gammel Mand ved Bordet, og han havde r&#xF8;dt Haar og sort Skj&#xE6;g. Saa t&#xE6;nker Karlen: &#x201D;Det kommer a nok skidt afsted med.&#x201D; Der var saa en Pige, der skulde vise ham op paa et Kammer oppe ovenpaa, og saa siger hun: &#x201D;A har saa ondt af det for dig.&#x201D; &#x201D;Hvad for det?&#x201D; siger han. &#x201D;Jo, for R&#xF8;verne de er ikke hjemme, det er jo en R&#xF8;verkule, du er kommen til, og det er ikke uden de gamle, du har siddet og spist med og snakket med, naar de kommer hjem, saa tager de dig af med Livet. Men her h&#xE6;nger et Stykke Reb, lad mig binde det paa dig, saa kan du selv hejse dig ud af et Vindue og ned til Jorden.&#x201D; Han takkede hende og fik Rebet, og saa hejsede han sig ned og gik derfra og kom v&#xE6;k. Han gaar nu videre den Nat og den n&#xE6;ste Dag, og saa kommer hamn til at losere i en anden Gaard Natten efter. Der gik en gammel Man ude i Gaarden, og han gik jo hen til ham og spurgte, om han han kunde faa Kvarter. Jo, det kunde han gj&#xE6;rne. Han kunde gaa ind til Konen, saa skulde han nok selv komme ind til ham, naar han var f&#xE6;rdig med at r&#xF8;gte ud. Han gik ogsaa, og da han kommer ind, saa kommer der et Karlfolk springende imod ham med Bugserne om H&#xE6;lene. Han saa nu, det var en ung Kone, og saa t&#xE6;nkte han: &#x201D;Dether kommer a nok ogsaa skidt fra.&#x201D; Naa, saa kommer den gamle Mand ind. Saa siger hun: &#x201D;Hvad var det for en Person, du viste her ind til mig, han vilde med Dj&#xE6;vels Gevalt have v&#xE6;ret &#xE6;paa mig.&#x201D; &#x201D;Ja, det kunde han da ikke vide.&#x201D; &#x201D;Jo, det er sandt,&#x201D; siger hun, &#x201D; det var da saadan.&#x201D; Ja, saa skulde han arresteres, siger Manden, og der kom Bud efter Sognefogden, og der kom to M&#xE6;nd til at sidde og passe paa Karlen. Hen ad Natten faldt de i S&#xF8;vn, men Arrestanten sov ikke. Saa kommer der en til Vinduet, og han siger til ham: &#x201D;Ja, i Morgen skal du jo kj&#xF8;res til Herresfogden og i Forh&#xF8;r.&#x201D; Ja, det skulde han vel. &#x201D;Men de tror ikke noget af det, du siger, de siger hele Tiden, det er L&#xF8;gn. Men saa skal du sige: Det skal han bevidne, der gaar her inden for.&#x201D; Du kan se mig, men det kan de andre ikke, og saa skal a nok komme og sige det, som det er.&#x201D; Men ham, der havde v&#xE6;ret paa Konen og kom med Bugserne om H&#xE6;lene, det var netop deres Pr&#xE6;st, og a tror saa galt han skulde hj&#xE6;lpe Konen til Rette med at vidne for hende, nok er det, han var da med som Vidne. Naa, saa kommer Tiden, han skal i Forh&#xF8;r, og de kommer saa derind paa Raadstuen. Karlen siger saa, idet han peger paa Pr&#xE6;sten, at der var den Person, der kom imod ham med Bugserne om H&#xE6;lene. De sagde jo, det var L&#xF8;gn. Men saa siger Karlen: &#x201D;Det skal han vidne, der gaar her udenfor,&#x201D; om han maatte ikke have Lov at kalde ad ham. Jo, det maatte han godt. Karlen gaar saa hen til Vinduet og kalder paa ham og sp&#xF8;rger, om han kan v&#xE6;re Vidne til det, han sagde. Det sagde han jo til. Saa bandt baade Pr&#xE6;sten og Konen Fanden tage sig paa, at det var L&#xF8;gn, men saa tog denher fremmede Person den ene paa Armene og den anden paa Nakken, og saa rejste han af med dem, for det var jo Fanden selv. Saa kunde de skj&#xF8;nne, det var sandt, Karlen sagde, og saa kunde han faa Lov til at gaa hans Vej. Han rejste saa videre af ad Hjemmet til. Kr&#xE6;mmeren, som han havde fulgtes med den f&#xF8;rste Dag, ham havde R&#xF8;verne undlivet, og ham h&#xF8;rer vi saa ikke mere til. Naa, saa kommer han endelig til Hjemmet, og Konen kjendte ham jo ikke. Han sp&#xF8;rger, om han kunde ikke blive der. Ja-a, han kunde jo gj&#xE6;rne blive, men hun havde ingen Steder at l&#xE6;gge ham, for hun havde ikke uden en Seng. Ja, han kunde godt sidde paa en Stol om Natten, og han bliver der saa. Da det saa bliver ved Sengetid, gaar Konen til Sengs, og han s&#xE6;tter sig paa Stolen. Saa kommer der en ung Person og l&#xE6;gger sig ved Konen i Sengen. Hen ad Natten kommer der en til Vinduet og pikker paa og siger til Karlen&#x2014;og han kunde h&#xF8;re, det var den samme, der f&#xF8;r havde talt til ham: &#x201D;Den Person, der ligger, han har ligget ved din Kone hver Nat, siden du rejste, og dersom det var mig som dig, saa gik a hen og slog Hovedet i Stykker paa ham eller skar Halsen over paa ham.&#x201D; Ja, han bliver jo ogsaa opirret og var der henne og vilde have skaaret hans Hals over. Men saa kommer han i Tanker om, hvad hans Husbond havde sagt til ham, at han ikke maatte tage sig nogle Gjerninger for, som han ikke vidste var gode, inden han havde l&#xE6;st hans Herrens B&#xF8;n tre Gange, og saa gj&#xF8;r han ogsaa det. Da vaagner Personen i det samme og siger: &#x201D;Aa, Moder a dr&#xF8;mte, min Fader var kommen her hjem og var her henne ved Sengen og vilde have skaaret Halsen over paa mig.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Aa, din Fader,&#x201D; siger hun, &#x201D;det er 18 Aar siden, a har set ham, han er nok d&#xF8;d for l&#xE6;nge siden.&#x201D; Det stod han jo og h&#xF8;rte paa, og saa kunde han jo skj&#xF8;nne, det var hans S&#xF8;n, han vilde have undlivet. &#x201D;Nej, a stedte ikke de Penge ilde, som a gav for det Raad,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;ellers havde a jo skaaret Halsen over paa min egen S&#xF8;n,&#x201D; og saa satte han sig stille hen i Stolen igjen, og ham uden for Vinduet han fik saa ingen Magt med det Raad han gav ham. Om Morgenen, da S&#xF8;nnen kommer op, saa vilde Faderen have ham til at gaa hen og hente en P&#xE6;gl til sig, og det gjorde han ogsaa, men saa vilde han ogsaa have ham til at drikke den med sig. Saa siger Moderen: &#x201D;Nej, det maa han ikke, han skal hen og i hans Tjeneste, for han tjener om Dagen og ligger her hjemme om Natten.&#x201D; Saa sagde han dem, hvem han var, og de var jo sv&#xE6;rt glade ved hverandre. Han fik saa Kagen frem, som han havde gaaet og baaret paa hele Vejen, og fik skaaret Hul paa den, og saa var der alle de Penge, han skulde have i L&#xF8;n, alle de 300 Daler, de var bagt ind i Kagen. Saa lever de godt ved hverandre den Dag i Dag er, og det sidste a var der, da fik a skold &#xD8;l paa en P&#xF8;lse, og Skindet sidder paa min N&#xE6;se endnu.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A girl and a boy worked together at S&#xF8;nder Tranders Hedeg&#xE5;rd (Heath farm), and it was a couple of humble people they worked for there. These people's pensioners were dead, and the pensioners' house stood vacant. Then the farmhand goes and seduces the girl. She goes to the husband and tells him how things were and asks him if she could have permission to stay there in the pensioners' house and have the child, because her beloved wanted to drive the cattle to Holsten , and it was in the spring he was to leave, that was the custom in the old days. She gets permission to do that, but the farmhand and the girl get married before he left. But the child was born before that and it was a boy, and it was also brought to the church since they had gotten married right away. Well, he went off . When he gets to Holsten and had gotten rid of the cattle, he stayed up there and started to work for a man there. The man didn&#x2019;t want to pay him any wages before he saw how he was and how they hit it off with each other. Well, this cattle driver was happy with that as well. One week after another went by, and the man offered him nothing, and the farmhand didn&#x2019;t ask for anything either except for what he needed, he got that, and they went on like that for eighteen years and he stayed there as if he was their own child. Then he says to the man one day: &#x201C;Tomorrow I want to go home and see my wife and my son.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;What, you&#x2019;re married?&#x201D; says the man. Yes, he was, and now he&#x2019;d decided that he wanted to go home, since he missed it. &#x201C;Well, then we&#x2019;ll have us a happy day today,&#x201D; says the man, and they sat down to celebrate. The man had put all the farmhand's wages together and he wanted to give them to him and it amounted to three hundred daler, that was big money in the old days. So they&#x2019;re sitting there and talking and drinking and then the man says: &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got a long journey ahead of you, and if you&#x2019;ll give me a hundred daler, I&#x2019;ll give you a good piece of advice that will serve you well.&#x201D; Sure, he&#x2019;d gladly do that, and they make the deal. The advice was that he must not take any shortcuts, but should follow the true country road. Then they had a few more drams, and then the farmer says: &#x201C;If you&#x2019;ll give me another hundred daler, then I&#x2019;ll give you another piece of advice.&#x201D; Sure, he&#x2019;d go along with that. &#x201C;You must not take lodgings where the fox builds over the raven, because things will go bad for you there.&#x201D; The farmhand keeps drinking with the man so long that he winds up giving him all his money back, and then he was to have one final piece of advice, and that was he must not take lodgings where there was a very old husband and a young wife, because things would go bad for him there. And then he wanted to give him another piece of good advice as a bonus, and that was that he shouldn&#x2019;t do any deed that he wasn&#x2019;t sure was a good deed before he had said the Lord&#x2019;s prayer three times. Then the man&#x2019;s wife says, &#x201C;Yes, now our father has wasted your time today, but I want to waste a bit of your time tomorrow, since I&#x2019;m going to bake and you are going to get a nice cake along with you on your trip.&#x201D; He got the nice cake and the wife told him that he must not cut into it before he got home and if his wife was dead then he was to come back and give the cake back. He promised her that and then he left. The first day he was out on his journey, he came to a peddler and followed along with him because they were going the same way. Then they come to a forest and then the peddler says: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a road through here, which is much shorter than the country road.&#x201D; He thinks a bit about this, but then he says no, he wants to follow the country road. But the peddler wants to go the other way, and so they split up there. When the peddler had gotten a little ways into the forest, he begins to shout and scream because robbers had come after him. Then the farmhand thought to himself: &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t waste that money that I paid for the first piece of good advice.&#x201D; He comes a little later to an isolated house in the forest and since it had become evening, he goes up there and asks for lodgings. He could certainly stay there. As they sit there eating dinner that night, there&#x2019;s an old man sitting at the table with red hair and a black beard. Then the farmhand thinks: &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t going to turn out well for me.&#x201D; There was a girl who was to show him up to a room upstairs, and then she says: &#x201C;I feel bad for you.&#x201D; &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Well, the robbers aren&#x2019;t home, this is a robbers&#x2019; den you&#x2019;ve come to, and there&#x2019;s no one here but the old guy you sat and ate with and talked to. When they come home, they&#x2019;ll kill you. But there&#x2019;s a piece of rope hanging here, let me tie it around you, then you can let yourself down out the window and down to the ground.&#x201D; He thanked her and took the rope, and then he hoisted himself down and went away from there and got away. He keeps going that night and the next day he comes to stay at another farm. There was an old man out in the courtyard and he went over to him and asked if he couldn&#x2019;t have lodgings. Sure, he certainly could. He could go inside to his wife and then he&#x2019;d come in himself, when he was done mucking out. He went in, too, and, when he gets inside, another man comes running toward him with his pants around his heels. He saw now that there was a young wife there and then he thought: &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t going to turn out well for me either.&#x201D; Then the old man comes in. Then she says: &#x201C;What kind of a person was that you sent in to me, he wanted to get up on top of me like the devil.&#x201D; Well, he couldn&#x2019;t have known that. &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s true,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;that&#x2019;s how it was.&#x201D; Well, then he was to be arrested, says the man, and they sent for the parish bailiff, and two men came to sit and watch the farmhand. During the night, they fell asleep but the prisoner didn&#x2019;t sleep. Then someone comes to the window, and says to the farmhand: "Well, tomorrow you are going to be driven to the district bailiff and be tried." Yes, he certainly was. &#x201C;But they won&#x2019;t believe anything you say, they&#x2019;ll say the whole time it is a lie. But then you are to say: The one walking outside here shall witness to that. You can see me, but the others can&#x2019;t, and then I&#x2019;ll come and tell it like it is. The one who had been on top of the wife and came running out with his pants around his heels, that was their minister, and I doubt that he&#x2019;ll help out the wife by witnessing for her, it will be enough that he is there as a witness." Well then the time comes, he is to be tried, and they go in there to the courtroom. The farmhand says, as he points at the minister, that he was the one who came at him with his pants around his heels. They said that was a lie. But then the farmhand says: &#x201C;He will witness to it, the one who is walking outside,&#x201D; couldn&#x2019;t he be allowed to call him? Well, yes he was allowed to. The farmhand goes over to the window and calls to him and asks if he can witness to what he had said. He said yes to that. Then the minister and the wife swore for the devil to take them, it was a lie, but then this stranger took one under one arm and the other by the neck and then he went off with them, because it was the devil himself. Then they could see that it was true what the farmhand had said, and then he was given permission to go on his way. He went along on his way home. The peddler whom he had accompanied the first day had been killed by the robbers and we don&#x2019;t hear anymore about him. Well, then he finally gets home and his wife didn&#x2019;t recognize him. He asks if he can&#x2019;t stay there. Well, he could stay, but she had no place for him to lie because she only had one bed. Well, he could sit in a chair at night, and so he stays there. When it gets to be bedtime, the wife goes to bed and he sits down in the chair. Then a young man comes in and lies down by the wife in the bed. During the night, someone comes to the window and raps on it and says to the farmhand--and he can hear that it was the same person who had spoken to him before: &#x201C;That person who is lying there has lain with your wife every night since you left, and if it were me, I&#x2019;d go over and knock his head off or cut his throat.&#x201D; Well, he gets provoked, too, and went over there and was going to cut his throat. But then he remembers what his master had said to him, that he mustn&#x2019;t do any deed that he didn&#x2019;t know was good before he had said the Lord&#x2019;s prayer three times, and so he did that, too. Then the person wakes up at once and says: &#x201C;Oh mother, I dreamed that my father had come home and was here by the bed and wanted to cut my throat.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh, your father,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;it is eighteen years since I&#x2019;ve seen him, he probably died a long time ago.&#x201D; He stood and listened to that, and then he could easily figure out that it was his son that he was about to kill. &#x201C;No, I didn&#x2019;t waste the money that I paid for that advice,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;otherwise I would have cut my own son&#x2019;s throat,&#x201D; and then he sat down quietly in the chair again, and the one outside the window gained no power with the advice he&#x2019;d given him. The next morning, when the son gets up, the father wants him to go and get a half pint for him and he did that, too, but then he wanted him to drink it with him, too. Then the mother says: &#x201C;No, he may not, he has to go to his work, because he works during the day and lies here at night.&#x201D; Then he told them who he was and they were very happy with each other. He took the cake out that he had been carrying the whole way and cut into it and then all the money that he was to have in wages, all three hundred daler, had been baked into the cake. So they live happily together even to this very day, and the last time I was there, I got scalded beer on a sausage and the sausage skin is still sitting on my nose.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This recording is another of Tang Kristensen's annotations concerning regional differences in pronunciation. Some of these annotations were made during the recording of other stories as is the case here. The annotation appears at the top of the page and comes in the middle of a fairytale performance (BJK 3.05). 

     It is unclear why Tang Kristensen, in the published version, changed the pronunciation in Ersted from t&#xF8;ste to toste. He used oe to designate &#xF8; in the second example.</annotation>

    <annotation>This folktale is cataloged in the fair copy collection as "The Robbers' Den" and indexed as ATU 956, "Hot Chamber in the House of Robbers (previously Robbers' Heads Cut off One by One as they Enter House)". The opening is somewhat tentative, but Jens quickly finds his rhythm.

     The girl--presumably also a kidnap victim--acts the role of the magical helper, and helps the knight defeat the otherwise overwhelming force of robbers. The helpful girl resonates with the previous story of the three good pieces of advice (BJK 3.05). The old hag in this story is perhaps most akin to a witch, although she has no overtly supernatural powers. 

     Although the bet is for one thousand dj&#xE6;vler, or devils, it is quite likely that Tang Kristensen misheard--daler would be a more likely thing to wager.

     Interestingly, the knight marries neither of the damsels in distress, and instead arranges a marriage for the first girl with one of his colleagues.

     Other stories of robbers that include a robber named Daniel usually single him out for being the worst of all (JPP 2.10). In an interesting twist, this Daniel is quite helpful, and is rewarded with ownership of the fort for his assistance.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a knight who came to a lonely place. I think that he'd been in league with some people there in the forest and had fled from them. Then he wanted to go in there and hide and stay there the night. Then he sees an old hag who is standing there with a young woman and is putting a necklace on her neck and she said that she had a pain in her neck. It hurt in the front and it hurt in the back and it was a horrible pain she had. This young woman was then to come and serve him and she wrote on the table, look out for me, I'm going to come again, and she served him with wine that had a sleeping potion in it but she threw it down onto the ground and then she said: That's right, my lord, drink it all, we have more. It pleased her, that he would drink so much. Everything so that the hag wouldn't notice anything. She gave him a note explaining how everything was to go. Then he settled down and he put a dead body in the bed. Then when they'd come home, the old hag was to light a light for them. Then the master of the fort who'd opened up for him, came and he was to stab him to death, but then the knight was standing behind the door with his sword drawn. When they came home, they'd taken a maiden in the forest, they had gotten a hold of her and she was his sweetheart, and then they'd eaten and gotten so drunk that it was frightening. The old hag's son had always had the first girl as a night friend, but now he wanted to have the new one instead. He bet 1000 devils with each one over who was to have her, the one felt he had more right to her than the next. The first girl sneaked out with a light and was going to check to see if he was asleep and she came back and said that he was sleeping now. So the fort master was to go and stab him to death. He went in there and shoved his dagger into him. That was well placed, said the old hag, it made such a deep "oh" sound. Then the knight came out and chopped off the head first of the fort master and then the hag but he didn't harm the girl. Then she ran in to the strongest of the men and said that he should go in and talk to the master and he came and stuck his head in the door and said some drivel, while the knight lashed out and his last words rolled across the floor. There was one named Daniel, and she asked for him. She had often seen him sitting crying in a corner with his wine because he had to be a robber. He was so strong. Then she called to him, he should come. When he came he put the sword right up to his chest, but didn't harm him. He said that now the holy woman [saved him] had kept her word, because he'd dreamed that a holy woman had saved him from this prison. Then he took a chair and broke the back off of it and went with that and killed all of them, because they were all so drunk. When he'd killed the fort master and the hag, he had gone to a place where the lord was, and he heard from inside there a hoarse woman's voice say: Yes, you have my life but you will never get my honor. Then he knocked down the door and went in and killed him. They were all killed all except for this Daniel. He put him in charge of it (the fort). The maiden got married, he got her one of the court's knights to be her husband.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en Ridder, a tror nok, han havde v&#xE6;ret i Forlegenhed med nogle R&#xF8;vere i en Skov, som han red igjennem, og han flygtede saa fra dem og kom hen til et enligt Sted, hvor han vilde tage ind og blive om Natten, for der troede han, han kunde hytte sig for dem. Da ser han en gammel Kj&#xE6;lling, der staar ved et ungt Kvindfolk og binder en Halskj&#xE6;de om Halsen af hende. Hun sagde, at det var Halspine, hun havde, og det plagede hende &#xE6;for, og det plagede hende &#xE6;bag, og det var en Fandens Pine. Denher unge Kvinde skulde saa hen og varte ham op. Men da skrev hun paa Bordet, uden at den gamle Kj&#xE6;lling m&#xE6;rkede det: Giv Agt paa mig, jeg kommer igjen. Hun skulde nu f&#xF8;rst bev&#xE6;rte ham med Vin, men den h&#xE6;ldte hun i Hemmelighed ned i Jorden, og saa sagde hun: &#x201D;Det var Ret, min Herre, drik saadan ud, vi har mere, det forn&#xF8;jer mig, at du vil saadan drikke.&#x201D; Det sagde hun jo altsammen, for at Kj&#xE6;llingen ikke skulde m&#xE6;rke noget. Der var nemlig Sovedrik i den Vin, hun gav ham, og hun vilde jo frelse ham. Saa gav hun ham en Seddel paa, hvordan han skulde b&#xE6;re sig ad i det hele. Han begj&#xE6;rede saa at komme til Ro, og den gamle Kj&#xE6;lling viste ham, hvor han skulde ligge. Han tog saa en d&#xF8;d Krop og lagde i Sengen, og selv stillede han sig bag ved D&#xF8;ren med hans dragne Sabel. Det var jo selve R&#xF8;verkulen, han var kommen til, og kort efter kom R&#xF8;verne hjem. De havde en Fr&#xF8;ken med sig, som de havde faaet fat paa inde i Skoven, og det var netop Ridderens Kj&#xE6;reste. Da de saa havde spist, drak de dem saa fulde, at det var forskr&#xE6;kkeligt. Den gamle Kj&#xE6;llings S&#xF8;n havde haft den f&#xF8;rste Pige til Natteven, men nu vilde han jo have den nye i Steden for. De sad og snakkede og v&#xE6;ddede med hverandre om tusende Dj&#xE6;vle, hvem der skulde have hende. Den ene mente, han havde mere Rettighed end den anden. Saa listede den f&#xF8;rste Pige sig ud med Lys og sagde, hun skulde hen at se, om den fremmede sov, og hun kom igjen og sagde: Nu sov han godt. Saa skulde Bargfogden hen og stikke ham ihjel, det var ham, der havde lukket ham ind, og den gamle Kj&#xE6;lling var med, hun skulde jo lyse for ham. Han gaar saa hen til Sengen og jager hans Dolk i ham. &#x201D;Det var godt truffet,&#x201D; sagde den gamle Kj&#xE6;lling, det gav saadan et dybt Ak. Men saa kom Ridderen, der stod bag ved D&#xF8;ren frem, og han hug Hovedet f&#xF8;rst af Bargfogden og siden af Kj&#xE6;llingen, men Pigen gjorde han jo ingen Fortr&#xE6;d. Hun l&#xF8;ber saa ind til den st&#xE6;rkeste af Karlene og siger til ham, at han skulde ind og snakke med Herren. Han kom ogsaa og stak Hovedet ind ad D&#xF8;ren og sagde noget sk&#xF8;ns Sludder, men Ridderen hug til, og Hovedet rullede hen ad Gulvet med det sidste Ord i Munden. Der var &#xE9;n af R&#xF8;verne, der hed Daniel, ham bad Pigen for. Hun havde saa tit set ham sidde i en Krog ved hans Vin og gr&#xE6;de for det, han skulde v&#xE6;re R&#xF8;ver. Saa kaldte hun ad ham, han skulde komme, og da han kom, satte Ridderen lige Sv&#xE6;rdet for Brystet af ham, men gjorde ham ingen Fortr&#xE6;d. Da sagde han, at nu havde den hellige Kvinde holdt hendes Ord, for han havde dr&#xF8;mt, at en hellig Kvinde havde reddet ham ud at dether F&#xE6;ngsel. Han var nu saa st&#xE6;rk, og saa skulde han gj&#xF8;re det af med de andre R&#xF8;vere. Han tog en Stol og vred (brej) lige Bagelaget af og saa gik han ind med det og slog dem allesammen ihjel, for de var jo saa fulde til Hobe. Imens det nu gik for sig, da gik Ridderen hen til det Sted, hvor Herren var inde, det var jo den gamle Kj&#xE6;llings S&#xF8;n, og han var jo kommen ind i et Kammer for sig selv tillige med den Jomfru, de nu sidst havde fanget. Da Ridderen kom til D&#xF8;ren, h&#xF8;rer han en h&#xE6;s Kvindestemme sige inden for: &#x201D;Ja, mit Liv har I, men min &#xC6;re faar I dog aldig.&#x201D; Ridderen spr&#xE6;ngte saa D&#xF8;ren og kom ind og slog R&#xF8;veranf&#xF8;reren ihjel. Nu var de blevne slaaede ihjel allesammen saa n&#xE6;r som Daniel. Han satte Ridderen saa til at have Opsyn med Ejendommen der, og han drog saa af med hans Kj&#xE6;reste, men Pigen, som havde frelst ham, hende skaffede han en af F&#xE6;stningens Riddere til Mand.

    <annotation>Jens's amusing ballad of the cobbler who seduces the miller's daughter has certain affinities with folktales in which a boy disguises himself to gain entry to the princess's bedroom (AMJ 1.08). It also resonates with folktales in which husbands are duped by their wives and lovers (see ATU 1355, "The Man Hidden under the Bed").

    As with BJK 1.22, Tang Kristensen based his main published version on a concatenation of collected variants, noting, "Alle de af mig indsamlede 12 opskrifter af visen (eller brudstykker deraf) har jeg sammenarbejdet til f&#xF8;lgende opskrift" [I have combined the twelve recordings of this ballad (or fragments of it) that I have collected into the following recording] (Kristensen DSk, 154). Fortunately, Tang Kristensen also included Jens's version in unedited form. There is a significant difference in length between Jens's version and the concatenated version presented at the end of this annotation. Tang Kristensen did not delete the obscene reference from the published version but did offer an alternate ending that substitutes crafts for the three children--mirroring the three crafts in the tale--rather than criminal behavior and execution. Jens, in his variant, ends his song with the miller's wife sinking into the mill stream. 

     The concatenated version reads as follows:

The cobbler and tailor hatched a plan,
they wanted to go to the miller&#x2019;s daughter

The cobbler stuffed the tailor into a sack
and carried him off to the mill stream

The cobbler carried the tailor to the mill dam,
and there stood the miller damming the water

And when he came to the mill bridge,
there stood the miller in his silver buckled shoes

&#x201C;And listen miller, both fair and fine,
can you mill my grain without charging me?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Listen, dear farmer, what is in your sack,
that you want to forbid me my fee?&#x201D;

&#x201C;On top is barley, and on the bottom is wheat,
and the little mice really want to eat that.

In the sack there is both barley and wheat,
and where can I put it, where it will be safe?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Well I&#x2019;ll store your mill sack
so it will be protected from rats and mice.

Put it up in my mill loft
tomorrow I will mill it as fine as dust.&#x201D;

&#x201C;No, I won&#x2019;t put my bag in your loft,
because rats and mice could eat it up.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Well then put it by our daughter&#x2019;s bed,
there aren&#x2019;t any mice running there.&#x201D;

Late at night, when the dew it fell,
the sack began to crawl and walk.

&#x201C;And listen, dear father, light a candle,
I think there are thieves in our house.&#x201D;

Then he patted her on her snowwhite cheek
&#x201C;Be quiet, it is your beloved.&#x201D;

She shouted: &#x201C;Dear father, blow out the candle,
it was only a cat that caught a mouse.&#x201D;

The old hag woke up in the corner:
&#x201C;I think the cat has boots on.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Listen, you hag, in the corner you lay,
tomorrow you&#x2019;re going out into the mill stream.

Shut up you hag, or you&#x2019;ll be shamed,
tomorrow your going into the mill pond.&#x201D;

Early in the morning that tailor he got up,
he tossed the hag into the mill pond&#x2019;s high water

Yes, the miller he stood on the driest land,
the hag lay out in the water and sang.

The hag sank, and the sack floated,
and all of her flour turned into porridge.

Yes, it wasn&#x2019;t strange that the hag was heavy,
since her cunt and ass weighed a hundred pounds.

The miller with his thick waist
was afraid he was going to lose his life.

The miller he had such a crooked tooth
he hooked that into the hag and pulled her to land.

That&#x2019;s what our daughter got for the mouse&#x2019;s walk,
she got two cradles by her bed.

There stood cradles by her bed,
the one was a girl and the other a boy.

And they grew up, and got so big,
the one became a thief and the other became a whore.

The one was hanged, and the other was burned
-Tyrilus out in l&#xF6;ndum
and there my ballad has an end.
-Since tonight we were so merry.

Another ending is not so bad and a bit more innocent:

It went on for five months
Our miller&#x2019;s daughter became uncomfortable

Yes, it went on for nine months,
she gave birth to two sons, had one more, and it was three

They stayed there for eighteen years,
You better believe they were happy in the miller&#x2019;s farm

The one became a cobbler, the other became a smith,
it went so bad, they had one who became a tailor</annotation>

    <annotation>This recording is Jens's second performance of this popular ballad (BJK 1.08). This variant was never published. The two recordings of the ballad are remarkably similar, with only minor changes in words. Tang Kristensen did not record some of Rosenillen's verses, particularly where she tells Nilwe the punishments in store for them, replacing them with ellipses. While it is conceivable that Tang Kristensen used this recording for JFm X, both the index to that work and the index to DgF refer to the previous version. On the other hand, the order of verses 6 and 7 in the published version corresponds with this later recording. Also, verse 8 corresponds with the prose mention in this recording of Rosenille going off to tell her beloved of her mother's reaction.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Rosenillen dances on the floor with vigor
so the milk sprang from her breast
-Haahaahaaha!

Listen, Rosenillen, dear daughter mine!
why does milk spring from your breasts?&#x201D;

It isn&#x2019;t milk, even though it looks it,
it is the wine we drank yesterday.

No, milk is white and wine is red,
the two are unlike each other.
The fox goes and sniffs
[He became somewhat picky and rooted about in the food] 

Dear mother, I cannot hide from you,
the young Mr. Nilwe has seduced me.

I will have him fried and burned
and send you far off to distant lands.

I&#x2019;ll have him hung from a branch,
and you yourself shall be sunk in a violent current.

Then she went and told her beloved
My mother will have you fried and burned
and me...

My mother...
......

Now pack all the red gold in a chest,
while I saddle my grey mare.

Then they rode their way.
When they got into Rosenslund,
Rosenillen wanted to rest a while.

I can&#x2019;t call for a midwife
Then she had to tie a blindfold over his eyes, 
and then he would do it without a midwife

No before a man shall learn of a woman&#x2019;s sufferings,
I would rather first die out here in Rosenslund.&#x201D;

Then [she] he lay out his cape so blue,
and she gave birth to two living sons on it.

Through Rosenslund there runs a stream,
Christ would I like a drink from that [them]

Mr. Nilwe was so true to [his] Rosenille,
that he got her water in his silver-buckled shoes.

He gave her water as he had no wine,
and therefore he lost his most beloved.

He dug a grave so wide and so broad,
and then he lay Rosenille in it first

He lay Rosenille out in the grave with comfort,
he lay the two living ones up to her breast.

Then he rode so far out into the woods,
he heard that the two living ones cry under the cover.

Then he placed his spear against a rock,
so that the point did great injury to his heart.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Second sight is not only reserved for the physically disabled in Jens's legends. Here, the unwitting poacher gets a magical seed in his shoes and acquires second sight. In this story, he witnesses the witches churning butter, no doubt from the cream of all the cows in the parish. Numerous stories attest to the magical qualities of bregnefr&#xF8; [bracken seed] harvested on a liminal night, generally the night of the witches' ride to the sabbath (Valborg or St. Hans eve) (AMJ 3.09). Part of the magic resides in the fact that bracken, as ferns, do not produce seeds but rather spores. Consequently bracken seeds, a biological impossibility, would necessarily be magical.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens's story of the brutality of a manor lord resonates with many other similar stories of overly cruel manor lords and the response of tenants to their demands and punishments. Among the reforms that came with the constitution in 1849 was a prohibition on the use of corporal punishment on tenants. 

     In this story, the capricious nature of Speitzer's punishments and the harsh demands of villeinage lead to the peasants' assault on him. Unlike other stories of cruel manor lords, the punishment in Jens's story does not take a supernatural form, such as being carried away by the devil  (JPP 2.05), a motif that does appear in other variants describing Speitzer's death (JAH II 254). Instead, the punishment is utterly of this world and verges on being a small scale peasant revolt. The story of Speitzer's beating is also mentioned in other stories (JAH II 254 and 255), and in their description, they emphasize that the assailants crushed Speitzer's right hand between two stones. 

     Jens's story about Speitzer is more elaborate than many other variants. He expands the story to include the apparent escape of at least one of the assailants. The little child nearly reveals the hiding place of the hidden assailant, but the child's speech is confusing enough that the scouts do not discover him. Hiding the assailant suggests a conspiracy among the peasants to protect their own against a fundamentally unjust system. The unjustness of the manor farm system, of course, lay at the root of the constitutional reforms of 1849; this story stands in part as one about the "bad old days," and the resourcefulness of the peasants in the face of that system.

     In the second part of the story, Jens returns his focus to Speitzer, and relates another incident that emphasizes Speitzer's arrogance and his cruelty. His refusal to confess to the minister underscores his unwillingness to be part of the (human) community. The lecherous manor lord is a motif found in other stories of cruel manor lords as well (PJ 2.01).

     Other stories suggest that Speitzer owned Aggersborgg&#xE5;rd, V&#xE5;r and &#xD8;rndrup. These three large holdings form a triangle with Aggersborgg&#xE5;rd in the northwest, V&#xE5;r twelve kilometers to the east, and &#xD8;rndrup seventeen kilometers to the south. &#xD8;rndrup is approximately twenty-four kilometers west of Ersted. When Speitzer offers one of the farms to Per Skytte, it is implicit that it is one of these three farms. Early records indicate that the Speitzer family owned Aggersborgg&#xE5;rd during that period, and that Mads Speitzer was the oldest son of Christen Madsen Speitzer (d. 2.5.1767) and Anna Margrethe Lund. Tang Kristensen normalizes the spelling from Speisser in the manuscript to Speitzer in the published version, basing his spelling on other stories about the manor lord.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Per Skytte and Kr&#xE6;n Gatten broke all Speisser&#x2019;s ribs. He was really bad about beating his tenants. The day before he&#x2019;d beaten a big boy who was the brother of Kr&#xE6;n Gatten. Kr&#xE6;n Hornum from Vester-Hornum said that he saw it. The next day, when Kr&#xE6;n Gatten was at the farm doing his villeinage, and they were raking and they&#x2019;d finished harvesting, he stayed back a little bit, so that Speisser would come over to him. It was down in a little depression in the field. Then Speisser comes over and says, &#x201C;Listen, Kr&#xE6;sten, can you give me a light?&#x201D; Then he asked him, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give you hell. What did you do to my brother yesterday?&#x201D; He began to lash out at him with his staff and said, &#x201C;Yeah, you can get some too, my good man.&#x201D; Then he [Kristen] jumped on him but he couldn&#x2019;t knock him over and then along comes Per Skytte and he [Kr&#xE6;n Gatten] says, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re a brave guy, then you&#x2019;ll help me.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;No, help me,&#x201D; said Speisser, &#x201C;then I&#x2019;ll give you one of my manor farms.&#x201D; His hat had come off and he was bald, Speisser was. &#x201C;OK, I&#x2019;ll help you,&#x201D; says Per Skytte and he smashed his rake down on his head, so that blood poured out of him, and then they knocked him out cold and then they stood on either side of him and kicked him on both sides and broke all his ribs. And when he stopped moving, they thought that he was dead. Then they ran off, but at that moment he lifted his head. &#x201C;Haven&#x2019;t you had enough yet? We&#x2019;ll give you some more,&#x201D; and they took a stone and put his right hand on it and took another stone and smashed his hand with it. Then they each took a horse and rode off. 
    Then scouts were sent out to find them. They also got so close to them, they came to a place where one of them was, it was probably Skytten. They had a little baby, who was crawling about on the floor, and when they came in there to search, they put him into a closet. Then this little child says, &#x201C;Man in the cave, man in the cave,&#x201D; The mother grabbed the child and got it out of the way, so they didn&#x2019;t find him. Then they went up to Holsten and got away. They say that Skytten later wound up living on Funen.
     Then they sent for the minister for this Speisser, or perhaps he came by himself. Then he says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve told you before Speisser, if you&#x2019;ve got anything on your conscience, tell me, because you&#x2019;ll probably not survive.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;ll confess only to my God in Heaven, and not to you.&#x201D; But he got better and then he said goodbye to the farm and traveled off to some place else. But his right hand never got better. He&#x2019;d lost his right hand, he said, but he&#x2019;d deserved Hell. The madam wanted so badly for him to die, but it didn&#x2019;t happen. When he called for her, or for the mistress and they didn&#x2019;t come, then he&#x2019;d finally have to call for the cleaning woman with whom he&#x2019;d lie and have sex with, and if nobody else would come, she would.
     Kirsten Hornum said that blood poured out of him for more than half an acre, since he was a beast, so fat and so strong, that Speisser.
     One time, all the peasants were all lying around sleeping, they didn&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d come. But then he came and he didn&#x2019;t say anything to them, but started to thrash them, and he continued to do so until they&#x2019;d all gotten some. Then one of them said, &#x201C;Usually lightning comes before thunder, but this time it thundered before the lightning.&#x201D;</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Speitzer var s&#xE5; slem til at banke hans hovfolk. S&#xE5; havde han en dag banket en stor dreng. Det var broder til Kr&#xE6;n Gatten. Kram Hornum fra Vester-Hornum har fortalt, at han s&#xE5; det. Dagen efter, da Kr&#xE6;n Gatten var til hove, og de havde oph&#xF6;stet og gik og rev, holdt han sig noget tilbage, for det Speitzer skulde komme hen til ham. Det var s&#xE5;dan i en lavning. Sa kommer Speitzer og siger:
"H&#xF8;r, Kristen, du kan vel sl&#xE5; mig en nist ild." &#x2014; "Du skal have Fanden, hvad var det du gjorde ved min broder i g&#xE5;r?" Han begyndte da at h&#xF8;de ad ham med kj&#xE6;ppen og sagde: "Ja, du kan f&#xE5; noget med, god karl." S&#xE5; sprang Kristen p&#xE5; ham, men han kunde ikke v&#xE6;lte ham, for det var et b&#xE6;st s&#xE5; tykt og s&#xE5; st&#xE6;rkt, denher Speitzer. I det samme kommer Per Skytte til. S&#xE5; siger Kr&#xE6; Gatten: "Er du en brav karl, sa hj&#xE6;lper du nu mig!" &#x2014; "Nej, hj&#xE6;lp du mig," sagde Speitzer, "s&#xE5; vil jeg give dig min ene herreg&#xE5;rd." &#x2014; "Ja, a skal hj&#xE6;lpe dig," sagde Per Skytte. Luen var kommen af Speitzer, og han var skaldhovedet, og s&#xE5; hug Per riven ned i hovedet af ham, te blodet det strittede lige ud af ham, og s&#xE5; hug de ham om kuld og stod ved hver side af ham og sparkede ham begge to ind i siden og gr&#xF6;ttede alle hans sideben. S&#xE5; troede de nu, han var d&#xF8;d, den gang han vilde ikke r&#xF8;re sig l&#xE6;ngere, og s&#xE5; rendte de. Men i det samme lettede han hovedet lige i vejret. "Har du ikke f&#xE5;et nok endnu," siger de, "da skal du endda f&#xE5;," og s&#xE5; tog de en sten og lagde hans h&#xF6;jre h&#xE5;nd p&#xE5; og tog en anden sten og gr&#xF6;ttede handen med p&#xE5; stenen. Dern&#xE6;st tog de hver en hest og red deres vej.
     S&#xE5; blev der sendt spejdere ud for at skulle have dem fundet. De kom ogs&#xE5; s&#xE5; n&#xE6;r til dem, at de kom til et sted, hvor den ene af dem var. Det var nok Skytten. S&#xE5; jog de ham ind i et kl&#xE6;deskab. De havde et bitte barn, der gik p&#xE5; gulvet, og da spejderne nu kom derind at s&#xF8;ge, s&#xE5; gik dether bitte barn og sagde: "Mand i kave, mand i kave."   Men de forstod det ikke rigtig, og moderen tog barnet og l&#xF8;b ud af vejen med det, s&#xE5; de fandt ham ikke. Flygtningerne tog op ad Holsten og kom da fra det. Skytten kom siden til at bo i Fyen, sagde de.
     Men nu var det Speitzer, vi skulde h&#xF8;re om. Pr&#xE6;sten kom til ham, eller ogs&#xE5; der blev sendt bud efter ham, og han sagde: "Ja, jeg har nok sagt Dem det, Speitzer. Har De nu noget p&#xE5; samvittigheden, s&#xE5; bekjend det for mig, for De kommer nok ikke fra det?" &#x2014; "Nej, jeg bekjender for min Gud i Himlen og ikke for Dem." Han kom sig dog nok igjen, men hans h&#xF6;jre h&#xE5;nd blev aldrig rask mere. Hans h&#xF6;jre h&#xE5;nd havde han mist, sagde man, men Helvede havde han tjent. S&#xE5; sagde han g&#xE5;rden farvel og rejste anden steds hen. Madammen vilde s&#xE5; gj&#xE6;rne, han skulde have d&#xF8;d, men det kunde nu ikke blive til noget. N&#xE5;r han kaldte p&#xE5; hende eller p&#xE5; jomfruen, og de kom ikke, s&#xE5; m&#xE5;tte han til sidst kalde p&#xE5; hans husholderske, som han l&#xE5; og h&#xE6;kkede med, og vilde ingen anden komme, s&#xE5; kom hun.
     Kristen Hornum sagde, at blodet l&#xF8;b af ham over en halv ager, da han skulde f&#xF8;res hjem.
     En gang havde alle hovfolkene lagt sig til at sove, for de troede ikke, han kom. Men s&#xE5; var han ved dem, inden de t&#xE6;nkte et ord af, han sagde ingen ting til dem, men begyndte at prygle l&#xF8;s p&#xE5; dem, og det blev han ved med, til de havde f&#xE5;et noget alle sammen. S&#xE5; var der en, der sagde: "Det plejer altid at lysne, f&#xF6;r det tordner, men denne gang tordnede det, f&#xF6;r det lysnede."</danish_publication>

    <annotation>Jens includes the interesting observation in this story that those who rose out of the peasant class became the worst tormentors of that class--Tang Kristensen moved this statement up to the very beginning of the story in the published version.

     Jens recounts several events that emphasize the harshness of Knud Tejl: he treats his brother as if he were a beggar; he forcibly conscripts a farmer, forcing his family into poverty; and he sentences a girl who has abandoned her baby to death. The capriciousness of his punishments and the callousness of his actions resonate with the previous story of the cruel manor lord (BJK 3.13). That Tejl commits suicide--an act closely linked to Satan--is not terribly surprising, given stories that tell not only of Satan coming to get a cruel, high status peasant-tormentor but also of him convincing people to commit suicide.

     The position of birkedommer, or independent district judge, was a position closely connected to manor farms. The birk was a jurisdiction sanctioned by the crown and independent from the district. Control of a birk allowed a manor lord and his appointed magistrates a great degree of power over the administration of the peasants who lived on the estate. The establishment of these independent judicial districts ended in 1809, and they were eliminated in 1849, insuring a more even-handed and consistent national approach to the courts and justice. Nevertheless, it was not until 1919 that the title of "birkedommer" was eliminated.

     In Tang Kristensen's field diary, the last story was separated from the rest of the record by a small line, an indication that Tang Kristensen interpreted it as a separate story. However, it is clearly connected to the previous story, and he published all of the stories that dealt with Judge Tejl together.</annotation>

His brother came to visit him once, for some reason or other, they put out a chair for him, but when he got up again, the madame said to the daughter she said that she should take a brush and brush off the chair, because she thought that he looked so slovenly. Then he left and she had the daughter run out to him with an eight shilling coin to give him. He said no thanks, he wasn&#x2019;t a beggar. The old ones said that there&#x2019;s no worse peasant tormentor than a peasant son. 
     There was an office in Aarestrup. A farmer from Oplev, Farmer Lars Jensen, went down to Torstedlund to borrow a barrel of oats and the district judge beat him so badly that blood flowed down his arms. Then they threw him into a chicken coop and he lay in there until they drove him to Aalborg and he was put into the army for eight years. His wife and children went to &#xC5;restrup to seek shelter, and then she went about begging. She had to do that. Her husband came home once in his uniform to visit his family, and they also went to church. He met the district judge there, but he wouldn&#x2019;t greet him.
     Later the district judge went to Hjedsb&#xE6;k, when he wasn&#x2019;t going to be judge any more, and he hung himself with his sheets. He lay there and he said, &#x201C;These are some damn long days.&#x201D; His daughter came in and saw that he was hanging there by the sheets and she was really shaken up by that. He was the manager of the manor farm there in Torstedlund.
     Two men were out walking near a little kj&#xE6;rv&#xE6;rk (stone wall) near a stream in the woods, they were from Skorup. Then one of them says, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s this lying here?&#x201D; The other one says, &#x201C;Well its probably some droppings from a cow.&#x201D; &#x201C;No, it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; He pushed it aside a bit with his staff, and there was a child inside it. And they say to each other, &#x201C;What should we say about that girl who is lying sick (pregnant) up there in Sk&#xE5;rup?&#x201D; They could do nothing other than report this and then the girl was brought to the court in &#xC5;restrup. She was so sick when they drove off with her that she couldn&#x2019;t take the wagon moving beneath her, and they had quite a time getting out there in time. Then Tejl sentenced her and then he supposedly said, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve now judged her head from her body, and if the king wants to put it back on, then he can.&#x201D;</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>    De gamle sagde, at der er ingen v&#xE6;rre bondeplager end en bondes&#xF8;n. Birkedommeren Knud Tejl i Torstedlund var ogs&#xE5; et slemt b&#xE6;st ved b&#xF8;nderne, og han var endda fra Tejlhus dernede p&#xE5; Skj&#xF6;rping mark. Han var tillige godsforvalter der i Torstedlund, og s&#xE5; var der skrivestue i &#xC5;restrup. Han havde en broder, der boede i hjemmet der i Skj&#xF6;rping, og han var en gang kommen hen at bes&#xF8;ge ham. De satte en stol til ham, men da han rejste sig igjen, sagde madammen til datteren, at hun skulde tage en b&#xF6;rste og b&#xF6;rste stolen af, for hun tykte, den mand s&#xE5; s&#xE5; snalleret ud, og da han s&#xE5; gik, lod hun datteren l&#xF8;be ud med en otteskilling til ham for at give ham. Han sagde nej tak, han var ingen tigger. Ja, det var en kj&#xF6;n behandling at f&#xE5; i sin broders hus.
     En g&#xE5;rdmand fra Oplev, Lars Jensen hed han, gik ned til Torstedlund for at l&#xE5;ne en t&#xF8;nde havre. Men s&#xE5; bankede birkedommeren ham s&#xE5;dan, at blodet l&#xF8;b ned ad hans arme. Dern&#xE6;st smed de ham ned ad et h&#xF6;nsehus, og der l&#xE5; han s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge, indtil han blev kj&#xF8;rt hen til Aalborg og blev gjort til soldat i 8 &#xE5;r. Konen og b&#xF6;rnene kom s&#xE5; til &#xC5;restrup at fa husly, og s&#xE5; kunde hun g&#xE5; og tigge. Det var hun jo n&#xF8;dt til. Manden kom en gang hjem i hans milit&#xE6;rkl&#xE6;der for at bes&#xF8;ge hans familie, og s&#xE5; var han ogs&#xE5; til kirke. Der m&#xF6;dte han birkedommeren, men han vilde ikke hilse p&#xE5; ham.
     Da Knud Tejl ikke skulde v&#xE6;re birkedommer l&#xE6;ngere, kom han til Hjedsb&#xE6;k, men det var nogle Fandens lange dage, han havde der, for han blev syg og sengeliggende og l&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge. Endelig h&#xE6;ngte han sig i hans sengeb&#xE5;nd. Hans datter der kom ind og s&#xE5;, han h&#xE6;ngte der, hun fik et r&#xF6;relse efter det.
     Fra den birkedommers tid kan a fort&#xE6;lle endnu en historie. To m&#xE6;nd fra Sk&#xE5;rup gik ude ved noget kj&#xE6;rv&#xE6;rk ved en b&#xE6;k i skoven. S&#xE5; siger den ene: "Hvad er det, her ligger?" Den anden siger: "Tu, det er vel noget skarn af et hoved. Nej, det er ikke." Han pirrede til side med hans kj&#xE6;p, og da var der et barn inde i det. S&#xE5; siger de til hinanden: "Hvad mon vi skal sige om den pige, der ligger her oppe og er syg i Sk&#xE5;rup." Det kunde jo ikke v&#xE6;re andet, end dether m&#xE5;tte m&#xE6;ldes, og s&#xE5; blev pigen kj&#xF8;rt til tinget i &#xC5;restrup. Hun var s&#xE5; syg, den gang de kj&#xF8;rte med hende, at hun kunde ikke t&#xE5;le, vognen gik under hende, og manden d&#xF6;jede s&#xE5;dan med at komme derud til tiden. S&#xE5; d&#xF6;mte Tejl hende til d&#xF8;den, og da skal han have sagt: "Nu har vi d&#xF6;mt hende hovedet fra, vil kongen nu s&#xE6;tte hende det p&#xE5; igjen, s&#xE5; kan han."</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The old people said that there&#x2019;s no worse tormentor of peasants than the son of a peasant. The district judge Knud Tejl from Torstedlund was also a terrible beast to the peasants, and he was himself from Tejlhus down there near Skj&#xF6;rping field. At that time, he was also the foreman over there in Torstedlund and he also had an office over in &#xC5;restrup. He had a brother who lived at home there in Skj&#xF6;rping, and he once had gone to visit him. They put out a chair for him, but when he stood up again, the lady of the house said to her daughter that she should take a brush and brush off the chair, because she thought that he looked so slovenly, and then when he left, she had her daughter run out with an eight shilling coin to give to him. He said no thanks, he wasn&#x2019;t a beggar. Yeah, that was nice treatment to get in your own brother&#x2019;s house.
     A farmer from Oplev, he was called Lars Jensen. He went down to Torstedlund to borrow a barrel of oats. But then the district judge beat him so badly that blood flowed down his arm. Then they threw him into a chicken coop and he lay in there for quite a while until they drove him to Aalborg and he was put into the army for eight years. His wife and children went to &#xC5;restrup to seek shelter, and then she went about begging. She had to do that. Her husband came home once in his uniform to visit his family, and they also went to church. He met the district judge there, but he wouldn&#x2019;t greet him.
     When Knud Tejl was no longer to be the district judge, he went to Hjedsb&#xE6;k, but he had some really long days there, because he took ill and lay in bed for quite a while. He finally hung himself with his bedsheets. His daughter, who came in and saw him hanging there, was really shaken up by that.
     I can tell another story from the time of that district judge. Two men were out walking near a little stone wall near a stream in the woods. Then one of them says, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s this lying here?&#x201D; The other one says, &#x201C;Well its probably some droppings from a cow."

She was so sick when they drove off with her that she couldn&#x2019;t take the wagon moving beneath her, and the coachman had quite a time getting out there in time. Then Tejl sentenced her to death and then he supposedly said, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve now judged her head from her body, and if the king wants to put it back on, then he can.&#x201D;</english_publication>

    <annotation>Stories of seducing hired girls are not very common in Danish tradition. It is interesting to note that in this story the wife forces the girl--rather than her husband--into a position of public humiliation. Jens provided no explanation as to why the wife may have put her husband up to seducing the girl, and less reason for her accompanying the girl to confession. The public humiliation seems complete when the wife lifts the girl's skirt as they leave the church. Yet one can just as easily read the wife's action as one of solidarity--she supports the girl when she confesses her affair to the minister, and then crudely insults the curious villagers who have come to hear the minister scold the girl. The wife's insult is, of course, the narrative focus of the story.

     The published version of the story does not include the introduction that mentions Judge Kalmar, a clear narrative link between this story and the preceding one (BJK 3.14). Similarly, the published version does not include the ambiguous reference to "Sara." Since the name "Sara" does not appear in any of Jens's other stories, he must be either referring to a person both he and Tang Kristensen knew or, as is more likely the case, referring to the young girl who abandoned her child in the preceding story and was sentenced to die.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a district judge Kalmar here in Torstedlund and he was buried here in the church. There were no graves with inscriptions on them here in the churchyard except for one for a forest ranger who'd seduced a girl, it might have been his own wife who'd put him up to it. She herself accompanied the girl to the church and opened the door for her when they went to confession. There were a lot of people in the church who wanted to hear how the minister would scold them. When they left the church, the wife put her arm around the girl and accompanied her down through the churchyard gate, and then she grabbed hold of the back of her skirt and lifted it up a bit and said, "Now you've seen her from the front, and now you've seen her from behind, now you can see her right in the ass." So now they had that. Pretty soon it went just like it went with Sara with her. That forest ranger was Jens Rebild over in Espelund which now is usually called Skovhuset.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Although this story is set in the historical past--a time before the dissolution of the birkeret (manor farm controlled judicial regions)--it does bring to the fore the questions concerning care for the poor that were an important focus of local political debates until the beginning of the twentieth century (and, in fact, continuing to the current time).

     One of the main philosophies of Danish poverty assistance was that each parish should be responsible for their own poor. Debates raged for many years over what constituted "belonging" in a parish, and the standard became five years residence (as opposed to the conservative position of birth parish). Poor people who tried to collect assistance in a parish other than their own were deported back to their parish. Beggars were subject to punishment, although in most cases they were simply returned to their home parish. Kalmar's punishment of Sidsel was unusually harsh. 

     The poor woman, Sidsel, gets her nickname "heel" in a typical fashion: a physical or personal trait becomes the basis for the moniker. In other cases, such as in the case of cunning folk, place names are appended as the nickname.</annotation>

They called her Sidsel H&#xE6;ls because she'd tied her heel up to her ass. It was the custom back then to drive around with the poor and the one who had the "poor staff" had to do that. It was a seat plank with a large number of loads counted out on it, and when one man had driven he'd hand it off to his neighbor. But this here Sidsel couldn't do this in the areas where they knew her, and then she'd gone all the way over to Store-Restrup to beg. The foreman at the manor asked her where she was from, and she admitted that she was from &#xC5;restrup so then he wrote to Kalmar and teased him a bit that he allowed people like that go around begging. There weren't any cripples like that on his manor. Finally they figured out that this had to be her, and so she wound up being forced to ride the wooden horse. She was there for so long that she'd almost died, that was a nice welcome for a woman. Soon after that, Kalmar got sick and died.

    <annotation>The wandering tailor is a well known figure in Danish legend tradition (KMP 1.23), and they were often subject to ridicule (KMP 1.28, 2.18 and 2.19). Here, the tailor is described as unusually shy around women to the extent that he even refuses to measure them.

     Labeling the tailor a beggar is somewhat unfair, since his possession of the poor board indicates clearly that his assistance was being supervised by the local authorities.   Prior to reforms in the poverty assistance laws in 1803, the most common form of care for the poor was "omgangsfors&#xF8;rgelsen" [revolving assistance]. Under this system, a person was assigned to a series of farms, and they would go from one farm to the next listed on their stakkelsfj&#xE6;l (poor board) to receive help  (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940 (1979), 10-11). After the land reforms of the late 1780s and the subsequent physical relocation of farms out onto the newly apportioned fields, the system was no longer sustainable since the distances between farms had become quite large. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, revolving assistance had been replaced by direct assistance, both in kind and monetary assistance, and the establishment of poor houses and, later, poor farms.

   
     The lengths to which Hjorde-Jens and then Truukr&#xE6;n go to avoid paying for the tailor's burial are morbidly comical. In that sense, the story parallels folktales in which corpses are posed to look like the living (PJ 1.02).The cost of burying those receiving poor help accrued to the local parish board, and not to the individual farmer who happened to be housing the person at the time of their death (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940). The story is apocryphal: since Jens apparently knew Truukr&#xE6;n, the events described here cannot have happened earlier than the 1820s, even though the system of assistance described here ended in the first decades of the century (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940, 11).

     The manuscript makes no distinction between the preceding story and this one. In the published version of this story, Tang Kristensen changed the order of events, describing the tailor's death first. He also editorialized on Jens's performance of the story, noting: "It was quite funny to hear my informant pronounce the tailor's Jutish sentences, since he comes from &#xC5;restrup and always uses "w" in his speech, used "v" here to make it clear that the tailor was from Rold, where they use that sound." Although Tang Kristensen was primarily commenting on differences in local pronunciation, he inadvertently provided helpful information concerning the performance of the story. Because of this note, one can more easily imagine Jens switching voices and even speech patterns as he told the story, particularly when relating direct speech.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>When a beggar had gone through a town and asked for alms, then the townsfolk were supposed to drive them to the nearest town. Each town had their own "poor board." There was an old tailor from Rold who died at our neighbor's house, and the man who lived in the farm to the west he was an alderman. Now, the town in which he died had to pay for his burial. The tailor was the brother of the parish bailiff in Rold, and he went around sewing for people, but by the end he just went about begging, they called him the Rold Tailor, he was shy around women. At one place, he was sitting on the table sewing and the children were standing on the floor rocking a baby, while their mother was out milking at the moment, and they tipped over the cradle and it landed on top of the baby. But the tailor wasn't man enough to go over and help the little baby up, because it was a girl. When the mother came back in she said, "Couldn't you have done the baby a favor and picked the cradle up, it could have lain there and suffocated?" But he answered, "Nah, I won't mess with that shit, no sirree. If that shit had been a boy, then it would have been a totally different story." Kold-Jen's old mother wanted him to sew a dress for her, and she wanted him to measure her. But he answered, "Get out of here, I can make it fit you." She wanted it to be a bit nice and pretty and she stood and wriggled her shoulders. But he said, "Get out of here," and he didn't want to touch her. He could get all the town's dogs to follow along behind him in a line and he patted them and called out to them, "Are you coming over here, my friend, you are my only friend in the world. Do you remember the time I helped you out when you'd stolen all those wonderful herrings, I knew it, but I didn't say anything." Then he lay there and died at Hjorde-Jens's, and then he went over to Old Per, that was his neighbor, and he got him to help him carry him out and they placed him up next to a stone wall that was pretty tall, and tied his bag on him, and put his staff in his hand. It was early in the morning, before dawn. When daylight came, Hjorde-Jens came out and found him there and went over to the alderman, they called him Truukr&#xE6;n, and told him that. "Well," he says, "that's really bad," and he told his farmhand that he should harness the two gray horses to a dung wagon and go over and get him and then they drove him over to Rold over to the parish bailiff's farm. "I've brought your brother," said Truukr&#xE6;n, "he's dead." Well, then they could take him with them again, and bury him. But then Truukr&#xE6;n jumped off the wagon and took hold of the one dung board and Byrri-Niels took hold of the other, and then they dumped the tailor out of the wagon with his bag, and his basket and his things, and he fell down onto the ground, and then they jumped back up into the wagon and rode off. When they got to Tryss&#xF8;, they could hear that they were beating on the drum in Rold, they were going to gather and talk about what they should do with the tailor.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>N&#xE5;r en tigger havde g&#xE5;et byen her omkring og kr&#xE6;vet ind, s&#xE5; skulde folkene kj&#xF8;re ham til n&#xE6;rmeste by, og det skulde den, der havde "stakkelsfj&#xE6;len". Det var en s&#xE6;defj&#xE6;l, der var s&#xE5; megen l&#xE6;sning t&#xE6;llet ud i. Hver by havde sin fj&#xE6;l, og n&#xE5;r en mand havde kj&#xF8;rt, s&#xE5; flyede han den hen til hans nabo. N&#xE5;r en tigger d&#xF8;de p&#xE5; hans vandring, skulde den by, hvori han d&#xF8;de, koste hans begravelse. S&#xE5; var der en gammel skr&#xE6;dder fra Rold, der d&#xF8;de her inde ved vor nabo, han var broder til sognefogden i Rold, den samme skr&#xE6;dder. Hjorde-Jens, som han var d&#xF8;d ved, kom ind til Gamle-Per, der var nabo til ham ved den anden side, og fik ham til at hj&#xE6;lpe sig med at b&#xE6;re skr&#xE6;dderen ud, og de fik ham stillet an op til et kalgudige, fik hans pose bunden p&#xE5; ham og hans kj&#xE6;p i hans h&#xE5;nd. Stedet l&#xE5; skikkelig h&#xF6;jt, s&#xE5; det var nemt at f&#xE5; ham at se. Dether gik nu for sig om morgenen f&#xF6;r dag, og da det s&#xE5; blev dag, kom Hjorde-Jens jo ud og fandt ham &#x2014; skulde det forestille &#x2014; og han hen til oldermanden, de kaldte ham Truukr&#xE6;en, og fortalte ham om Rold-skr&#xE6;dderen, som sad der henne. "N&#xE5;", siger han, "det var d&#xF8;d og pine slemt". Han befaler hans karl, at han skal sp&#xE6;nde de to gr&#xE5; for en mogvogn og kj&#xF8;re hen og hente ham. S&#xE5; kj&#xF8;rte de til Rold med ham og ind til sognefogdens. "A kommer med din broder", sagde Truukr&#xE6;en, "han er d&#xF8;d". Ja, s&#xE5; kunde de tage ham med dem igjen og lade ham begrave. Men s&#xE5; sprang Truukr&#xE6;en ud til vognen, og han tog i den ene mogfj&#xE6;l og Byrri-Niels, der var med ham, i den anden, og s&#xE5; sk&#xF8;d de skr&#xE6;dderen af vognen med hans pose og hans kurv og hans sager, s&#xE5; han faldt ned p&#xE5; jorden, og s&#xE5; de op p&#xE5; vognen og af sted. Da de kom til Trys-s&#xF8;, da kunde de h&#xF8;re, der blev sl&#xE5;et p&#xE5; trommen i Rold, for s&#xE5; skulde m&#xE6;ndene jo samles og snakkes ved om, hvad de skulde have gjort ved skr&#xE6;dderen.
     Denher skr&#xE6;dder gik om og syede for folk, men til sidst gik han og tiggede. Han var sky for kvindfolk. Et sted han sad p&#xE5; bordet og syede, og b&#xF6;rnene stod p&#xE5; gulvet og bissede et barn, mens moderen lige i tiden var ude at malke, s&#xE5; fik de vuggen v&#xE6;ltet, og den kom oven p&#xE5; barnet. Men skr&#xE6;dderen var ikke karl for at turde g&#xE5; hen og hj&#xE6;lpe barnet op igjen, for det det var et pigebarn. Da moderen kom ind, sagde hun: "Kunde du ikke have gjort det s&#xF6;lle barn den tjeneste at have rejst bissen op, det kunde jo have ligget og kvaltes". Men han svarade: "Vild a r&#xE6;&#xE6;r ve de skit, nej s&#xE5;gu vild a ek. Havde det v&#xE6;ret et drengebarn, s&#xE5; havde det v&#xE6;ret noget andet". Kold-Jenses gamle moder vilde have ham til at sy en tr&#xF6;je til sig, og s&#xE5; skulde han tage m&#xE5;l af hende. Men han svarede: "&#xC5; vejen m&#xE6; d&#xE6;, a ka s&#xE5;gu gjaan paes ed". Han vilde ikke r&#xF8;re ved hende. Samme skr&#xE6;dder kunde godt f&#xE5; alle en bys hunde til at komme i en r&#xE6;kke bag efter sig. Han snakkede godt med dem og klappede dem, idet han sagde: "Kommer du her, min ven, du er mi ven i verden. Kan du howw, den gang a h&#xF8;lld &#xE5; d&#xF8;lld m&#xE6; d&#xE6; di manne gowe sild du stael, a vist ed n&#xE5;k, m&#xE6;n a vild et s&#xE6;jj ed".</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>When a beggar had gone through a town and gotten alms, then the townsfolk were supposed to drive him to the nearest town, and the one who had the &#x201C;poor board" had to do that. It was a seat plank on which had been counted a number of loads. Each town had their own plank, and when a man had driven he&#x2019;d give the plank to his neighbor. If a beggar died on his wanderings, his burial had to be paid for by the town in which he died. There was an old tailor from Rold who died at our neighbor&#x2019;s, he was the brother of the parish bailiff in Rold, that tailor. Hjorde-Jens, the guy whose house he&#x2019;d died at, got his neighbor on the other side, Old Per, to help him carry the tailor out and they placed him up next to a stone wall, tied his bag on, and put a staff in his hand. The place was fairly high and so it was easy to see him. This happened early in the morning, before daylight, and when it became daylight, Hjorde-Jens came out and found him &#x2013; at least it was supposed to appear that way &#x2013; and he went to the alderman, they called him Truukr&#xE6;n, and told him about the Rold tailor, how it was. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;that&#x2019;s really bad.&#x201D; He told his farmhand that he should harness the two gray horses to the dung wagon and drive off and get him. Then they drove him over to Rold and into the parish bailiff&#x2019;s farm. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve brought your brother,&#x201D; said Truukr&#xE6;n, &#x201C;he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201D; Well, the parish bailiff said, then they could take him back with them, and bury him. But then Truukr&#xE6;n jumped off the wagon and took hold of the one dung board and Byrri-Niels, who was with him, took hold of the other, and then they dumped the tailor out of the wagon with his bag, and his basket and his things, so that he fell down onto the ground, and then they jumped back up into the wagon and rode off. When they got to Try lake, they could hear that the drum was being beaten in Rold, so that the men could gather and talk about what they should do with the tailor. 
     This here tailor went around sewing for people, but in the end he went around begging. He was shy with women. One place, he was sitting on the table sewing and the children were standing on the floor rocking a baby, while their mother was just out milking, and they tipped over her cradle and it landed on top of the baby.

    <annotation>Jens provides a short account of a hostile interaction between local farmers and immigrant workers. The outsiders are described as immoral--dancing and gambling (details that Tang Kristensen deleted in the published version). To make matters worse, they criticize the locals' clothes.

     The published version of the account differs somewhat from the manuscript: the order of certain unbound, descriptive clauses (such as mention of the Norwegian and German workers' arrival) have been changed, and Jens's correction of Truukr&#xE6;n's comments about where he had seen the Norwegian workers has been eliminated.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens continues with his description of local characters, focusing on two local drunks. In addition to their very small holdings, the men supplement their income with making wooden clogs, a not uncommon practice (see chapters on Bitte Jens and Jens Peter). S&#xF8;ren &#xD8;sterg&#xE5;rd appears in one other story that Jens tells, witnessing Old Villads's attempt to meet the mound dwellers (BJK 1.23). 

     Br&#xE6;ndevin (distilled spirits) was often distilled illegally in local stills. Stories describe the various strategies people used to avoid detection by the authorities charged with the regulation of stills (KMP 3.12).

     The published version only includes part of the complete manuscript record, the rest of the record appearing in another published account (BJK 3.22). Tang Kristensen used the story in part to explain and record aspects of local folk speech and pronunciation.</annotation>

    <annotation>In his published collections, Tang Kristensen split the previous record (BJK 3.21) into two stories, appending BJK 3.24 to this record to complete the description of the vagabonds/thugs hiding out in the forest near Ersted. The clothing described is old-fashioned, and similar to descriptions of the clothing of rakkere (rakker means executioner's assistant and, later, nightman or refuse collector; it was often used as slang to denote a vagabond). "Langovrede tr&#xE6;sko" were clogs with a long front worn primarily by men in contradistinction to women's "kortovrede tr&#xE6;sko" with a short front, more in keeping with modern clogs. "Basarer" are also known as "nisse tr&#xE6;sko". This type of clog turns up in a point at the front. There is nothing to suggest that Jens Ingvorsen and S&#xF8;ren &#xD8;sterg&#xE5;rd were anything other than two local farmers given to drink.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens continues with stories about S&#xF8;ren &#xD8;sterg&#xE5;rd, focusing here on the absurd antics of the drunk man (BJK 3.21; also BJK 1.23). In the previous story, he rode on his friend, spewing obscenities, while in this story he is so drunk he does not realize that his wife is along in the wagon. 

     Alcoholism was a significant problem in rural Denmark. Attempts to start a temperance society were already underway in 1841. In 1879, the first of these societies came into being, closely related to the work of evangelical movements. Although the drunk man's antics are amusing, there is also a certain tension informing the story, as his drunkenness threatens to upset the fragile household economy.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>S&#xF6;ren &#xD6;sterg&#xE5;rd once went to Nibe market, and he'd gotten a load of herring and he'd bought some containers down there, platters and things like that. Then he'd gotten drunk and he tipped over, the roads weren't like they are now. His wife was with him and his brother too. "What should we do now? The plates have broken." - "Lets put the pieces of the plates in between the herring, and then we'll tell our Ane that the herring crushed the plates." - "Sure, we can do that." She was there with them. When they start driving again, he falls over backwards with his head in her lap, and then the brother has to take over the driving. "Hurry up so we can come home to my Ane, she always has wonderfully warm cabbage when I come home." He didn't remember she was with them and he was lying in her lap.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen published this short description of local expressions along with BJK 3.22 above, despite its location in the manuscript.  "Langovrede tr&#xE6;sko" were clogs with a long front worn primarily by men in contradistinction to women's "kortovrede tr&#xE6;sko" with a short front, more in keeping with modern clogs. "Basarer" are also known as "nisse tr&#xE6;sko". This type of clog turns up in a point at the front.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories of witch's stealing milk are widely attested. Here, the witch's magic relies on a form of contagion, the rope having been in close contact with the cows. In other stories, the witch steals milk by reciting a formula (DS VII 609), placing a piece of paper with writing on it in the churn (JPP 4.39; DS VII 612), or by using a milking stick (DS VII 592), a threshing tooth (DS VII 577) or even a finger of a glove (DS VII 591). 

     The threat to the entire community posed by the witch is made apparent in this tale. The witch directs her economic malice not at an individual farmer, but rather at the entire community. It can only be a form of poetic justice that an otherwise poor woman reaps the bounty of the witch's malice. One can perhaps read the story as a reference to the newly emergent form of assistance to the poor, where all the community members contributed to the support of the local poor.

     Prior to the land reforms in the late 1780s, it was common for the town to employ a single shepherd to herd and graze all the cattle in a single village. The system provided an economy of scale, since individual herds (a generous term) rarely consisted of more than two or three cows. Once communal farming was eliminated, the position of village shepherd also disappeared.</annotation>

As soon as she starts churning, the band falls off of it, it had stood there and gotten too dry, it was a pileb&#xE5;nd (willow band). So now she takes this piece of rope and ties it around the churn instead of the band, and now she churns away at the cream. But she gets so much cream, she poured it off and poured it off and the churn filled up again just as much and she got really scared and tells her neighbor that she should come and see this sight with all this cream. It was a witch who had put the piece of rope down so that all the town's cattle would walk over it, and then she'd come and take it and tie it around her churn, but now this other one got it instead.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Prior to the reform of the trade laws in 1857, it was illegal for people to sell provisions outside of the market towns. The new law still governed trade within a seven and a half kilometer radius around market towns. This prohibition contributed to a wide scale barter economy, black market sales, the fairly common phenomenon of wandering peddlers and, at the end of the century, the emergence of the purchasing cooperatives. This latter development allowed rural populations more control and much greater access to provisions, even during the late winter and early spring.</annotation>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen did not publish any of these very short annotations. The first is probably a note he made reminding himself  to ask Jens to tell the story of Niels Mortensen (BJK 3.36). The next two annotations are less clear. There is no other mention of Jens Larsen and it is quite possible that Jens was simply recounting a noteworthy event. The last account has two components to it. The first part, mentioning that the hay and the chicks, is told in dialect, while the second part, refers to practices concerning the first sheaf (Sydow 1948).</annotation>

    <annotation>Skjel-Jens's refusal to drive wood for the manor lord leads to calamity for his unusually large family. He is sentenced to incarceration, where he subsequently dies, while his wife and children are forced from their home. Presumably, the wife and children were forced onto the parish poverty assistance rolls. Application to the king was a possible recourse in cases such as this, although as noted here, the king was reluctant to get involved in matters that were considered to be of a local nature and under the jurisdiction of the manor farm (possibly a birk). 

     Villeinage was one of the main flash-points for political engagement among the smallholders. Although this story is set further back in time--prior to the constitution and the dissolution of the absolute monarchy--the smallholder's refusal to work for the manor lord resonates well up through the nineteenth century.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>The farmer ordered that every man on the manor farm was to drive half a cord of wood to Hobro, and Skjel-Jens refused. Then they came one afternoon when they were baking and threw them out of their house, they had eighteen living children. And they threw all their possessions and the children's clothing out. They put the husband in jail, he was supposed to be there for two months, but he didn't want to go home again, because he had a real bitch at home and all these children, and so he stayed and half a year later he died there in the jail. They took a really nice grate for roasting herring, and the old lady said, "Yeah, you take that, Satan will roast your soul on it in Hell." She said to Rommedal, the foreman, that she'd go to Copenhagen and talk to the king about this. He said he could accomplish more with his writing in two hours than she could accomplish in Copenhagen in two years. She really did travel to Copenhagen and also managed to talk to the king, but didn't get anything out of it. He answered that he wasn't the absolute monarch. He in fact was, but he probably believed that he wasn't the only one who made decisions. It was strange that he wouldn't drive, he had two large, strong horses, but it was his old lady's fault. She said that she had eighteen children and that she could have had eighteen more, if she could have made them. He lived in what they now call Mylenbj&#xE6;rg, they called it Skjelhusene then. Rommedal had an office in Rold and came there once in a while, but which manor farm it was I don't know. That same old lady she had her children go up to the foreman's office when he was there and shout, "J&#xF6;rgen Petersen, Palteren, Pommerg&#xE5;lten!" and then they'd swear at him to boot. All the children lived in the hall room in Tveden at my grandfather, the brother of Sjel-Jens, Skjel-Peder's place.</english_manuscript>

Han havde rigtig nok et par store, st&#xE6;rke b&#xE6;ster, men det var kj&#xE6;llingen, der fik ham til det, for hun var noget gal i det. S&#xE5; kom forvalteren en dag, de var ved at bage, og smed dem ud og alle deres sager og b&#xF6;rnenes kl&#xE6;der med. De havde atten levende b&#xF6;rn. Konen kom s&#xE5; til at sidde henne hos Skjel-Peder i Tveden, der var min gamlefader, der sad de alle sammen b&#xE5;de hun og b&#xF6;rnene i deres gangkammer.

Til forvalteren sagde hun, at hun skulde nok rejse til Kj&#xF6;benhavn og snakke med kongen om det. Han svarte, at han kunde udrette lige s&#xE5; meget ved hans skriven i to timer, som hun kunde udrette i Kj&#xF6;benhavn i to &#xE5;r. Hun rejste virkelig til Kj&#xF6;benhavn og fik ogs&#xE5; talt med kongen, men fik ikke noget ud af det. Han svarte nok, te han var ikke enevoldsherre. Det var han jo dog alligevel, men han mente vel, at han var ikke ene om at st&#xE5; for det.
      Den samme kj&#xE6;lling sagde, at hun havde atten b&#xF6;rn, og hun kunde have f&#xE5;et atten til, dersom hun kunde have f&#xE5;et dem lavet. Hun fik hendes b&#xF6;rn til at g&#xE5; hen til vinduerne p&#xE5; forvalterens skriverstue, og r&#xE5;be, n&#xE5;r han var der: "J&#xF6;rgen Petersen, Paltersen, Pommerg&#xE5;lten!" og s&#xE5; bandte de ham oven i kj&#xF8;bet. Den forvalter boede i Hobro og hed J&#xF6;rgen Peter Rommedahl, men han havde en skriverstue i Rold og kom dertil en gang imellem, men hvad gods han var forvalter p&#xE5;, v&#xE9;d a ikke. Manden, de jog v&#xE6;k, boede i Skjelhusene, det, de nu kalder Mylenbj&#xE6;rg.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The manor lord ordered every man on the manor farm to drive half a cord of wood to Hobro, and Skjel-Jens refused. He had, sure enough, two large, strong horses, but it was his old lady who probably made him do it, she was a bit crazy. Then the foreman came one day when they were baking and threw them out of their house, along with all their possessions, even the children&#x2019;s clothing. They had eighteen living children. The wife wound up staying over with Skjel-Peder in Tveden, he was my grandfather, and there she sat with all the children in their hallway. They put the husband in jail; he was supposed to be there for two months, but he didn&#x2019;t want to go home again, since he could imagine how bad things were, and so he stayed and died half a year later there in the jail.
     When they threw their possessions out, they also took a really nice grate for roasting herring, and the old lady said, &#x201C;Yeah, you take that, Satan will roast your soul on it in hell.&#x201D; She said to the foreman that she&#x2019;d go to Copenhagen and talk to the king about this. He said he could accomplish more with his writing in two hours than she could accomplish in Copenhagen in two years. She really did travel to Copenhagen and also managed to talk to the king, but didn&#x2019;t get anything out of it. He answered that he wasn't an absolute monarch. He in fact was, but he probably believed that he wasn&#x2019;t the only one who made decisions.
     The same old lady said that she had eighteen children and that she could have had eighteen more, if she could have had made them. She had her children go up to the foreman&#x2019;s office when he was there and shout, "J&#xF6;rgen Petersen, Palteren, Pommerg&#xE5;lten!&#x201D; and then in addition they swore at him. This foreman lived in Hobro and was called J&#xF6;rgen Peter Rommedahl, but he had an office in Rold and went there once in a while, but I don&#x2019;t know for which manor farm he was the foreman. The man whom they chased away lived in Skjelhusene, the place that they call Mylenbj&#xE6;rg these days.</english_publication>

    <annotation>These are two verses of a widely attested ballad, cataloged in DgF as 258, "Skj&#xF8;n Anna" [Pretty Anna]. Grundtvig proposed that the ballad came to Denmark via northern Germany, and was no older than the fifteenth century. It was widely circulated as a broadside, and was published as number 17 in Peder Syv's collection. The version that Jens knows is based on a broadside, with an earliest attestation of 1648. Jens's two verses correspond to a concatenation of the first four verses of the F variant.

     Tang Kristensen did not publish this fragment nor do the verses appear in DgF. The annotation in DgF mentions solely that the fragment was collected by Tang Kristensen from Jens (DgF X, 637).</annotation>

    <annotation>The "Bird ballad" Jens mentions here does not appear in the field diaries. Instead, Jens provides a description of how the song came to be and the performance contexts for the ballad. The ballad describes in humorous tones a wedding celebration held by birds (owls, storks, crows, eagles, etc.) where many of the guests get fall-down drunk. The humor lies in the anthropomorphism of the birds, and their actions and statements while drunk. Jens appears to be familiar with the ballad, but not so familiar with it that he counts it in his active repertoire. Instead, Jens emerges as a passive participant in this ballad tradition.

     In Gamle Danske Sk&#xE6;mteviser, Tang Kristensen published two versions, an "A" version collected from Niels Madsen in Bratten, and a "B" version, concatenated from 10 fragments. In a brief forward to the ballad, Tang Kristensen noted: "This ballad is well attested all over Europe. It is also printed in Skattegraveren I, 836. A quite simple form has found its way to many of our ballad books, and has become known from there, yes, even published as a beautifully illustrated children's book. Compare with the Faroese, Svabo I 113. The ballad is found in German (Uhland and others), Serbian, Slavic, Russian, Slovenian, Lithuanian and similar ballads in Estonian, Dutch, and French. The construction of the ballad indicates that it comes from abroad, but came here quite early and has become quite popular. I know of no variants from Sweden or Norway." 

     Tang Kristensen did not refer to Jens's remarks as constituting a variant, but rather suggested that the description be taken "for hvad den er" [for what it is].</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens sings a song that accompanies the procession that occurs during Hellig Tre Kongers (Feast of the Magi) [January 6]. In many villages, either groups of men or a man would wander from house to house with a picture of a star or a lantern with a star shaped lens, and sing a ballad known as the "Star Ballad." The ballad Jens sang is unlike most of the other ballads associated with this practice and much more like a church hymn. The ballad is not included in DgF.

    In the manuscript, there is an odd parenthetical interruption where Tang Kristensen has recorded several phrases that have nothing to do with the ballad. It is unclear exactly what these two lines mean. The published version adds additional detail in the final verse that is not found in the manuscript.</annotation>

    <annotation>The first day of May was widely celebrated as the advent of summer. The days had gotten longer and the crops had been sown. Mayday celebrations are attested throughout Scandinavia and often include various symbolic expressions linked to fertility.

     As an introduction to the ballad, Jens describes a mumming tradition in which two local farmhands play the role of the two seasons. The people who accompany the two mummers ask for food or other handouts--a form of sanctioned begging, much like Halloween in the United States.</annotation>

they sit in shit and can&#x2019;t go anywhere

In Rold, they&#x2019;d sing the following verse after the ninth one:
Ham hocks are such a terrible fare
we&#x2019;d much rather have an old cheese

But if we can&#x2019;t have the old cheese
we&#x2019;ll put the knife to the ham hocks

They rode on Whitsun, and the party was held that afternoon.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens continues to talk about the celebration of "riding summer" (BJK 3.34),  but links these celebrations to a legend about the mound dwellers. The celebrating youth apparently disrupt the peace of the mound dwellers' home who take swift retributive action. Preparing food out in the fields is somewhat unusual, except at harvest and planting time, and the mound dwellers' actions force a return to normalcy, a normalcy that the mumming and the celebration have disrupted.</annotation>

    <annotation>The story of Niels Mortensen plays on the notion that external appearances can be deceiving. Niels may well have worn the ragged clothing as a way to divert attention from himself, given the rather large amount of money that he was carrying. As such, his actions might have been informed by stories about robbers. Jens engages in an interesting narrative ploy, allowing two characters in his story to comment on the outward appearance of Niels.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is a more complete version of the home invasion robbery story that Jens had told during a previous session (BJK 1.37). The story emphasizes the cruelty of the robbers, as well as the almost miraculous escape of the farmer's wife. Interestingly, the story does not relate what happened to the robbers--whether they were captured or not--and leaves open the threat of their possible return.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Peder Hjort, Skj&#xE6;rslipper-Lassen and Bitte-Fanden robbed him once. There were two wallets, which were on their sides in the closet and they were both as thick as psalm books, and they weren't locked.

They got a hold of her kerchief, and they bound her hands with it, but didn't pay attention whether it was in front of her or not. She got loose, and they grabbed her by the neck and banged her three times against the floor, and then said, "Now she's had enough." They'd baked the day before, and the breads were laying on the bench in front of the table, but they'd fallen, and she was lying there with all the bread and she crept away and got out wearing only her nightshirt. She ran over the ice in her bare feet to a man who lived a bit to the south. They beat up her husband who was lying in bed, they'd taken a piece of fencepost and they beat him with it so hard that there was both skin and hair hanging off of it. There were no fewer than thirty-six stab wounds in his thigh. They wanted to tie his hands behind his back, but couldn't, in part because he was too strong, and in part because his arms were too stiff, they couldn't bend them. Then they discovered that the wife was gone, and they grabbed the money and got out of there.

    <annotation>Jens's brief account of Kr&#xE6;n Hyldg&#xE5;rd's interaction with the aristocracy and the aristocrat's main judicial officer, the birkedommer, refracts many of the tensions that existed between the clearly defined classes. Kr&#xE6;n's insult of the manor lord's servant should trigger fairly severe punishment, an indication of the disparity between those in direct employ at the manor and day laborers in general. Kr&#xE6;n espouses decidedly egalitarian (read post constitution) values in his response to the judge. His forthrightness and the lingering threat of retaliation--a metonymic representation of the increasing threat of outright revolt that contributed to the constitutional reforms--allow him to walk out with his dignity and his hide intact.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens's next story confirms that Kr&#xE6;n Hyldg&#xE5;rd "wasn't so nuts," as proposed in the preceding account (BJK 3.38). The tithe referred to in the story is an in-kind payment, in addition to villeinage, that accrued to lease- and copyholders on the large manor farms. Refusal to pay would be akin to not paying rent, and could lead to eviction. Many smallholders found that between the capricious demands of villeinage and the inflexibility of their tithes, there was little chance for economic advancement or even economic stability. 

      Kr&#xE6;n's response to the lady at the manor takes her by surprise, and she reveals a degree of compassion--misplaced in this case--that otherwise is not attributed to the aristocracy. The ability of the peasant to trick the aristocracy resonates with other stories about the interactions between peasants and their landlords (JPP 2.05).

      Tang Kristensen added the commentary on Kr&#xE6;n Hyldg&#xE5;rd's misrepresentation to the lady in the published version of the story.</annotation>

    <annotation>Charcoal burning was a source of ready income for those who lived near the forest and had permission to do so. Ash was far less valuable than charcoal. Kr&#xE6;n's receipts from his sale of charcoal and ash were equivalent to one and a half marks. He reacts in typical fashion to his neighbors attempted derision, proposing that his neighbor had received a windfall for ash (rather than charcoal). In all the stories about Kr&#xE6;n Hylg&#xE5;rd, Jens focuses on the quick, witty verbal response of Kr&#xE6;n to criticism or threat.

Up until the currency reform of 1873 (implemented in 1875), several different currencies were used in Denmark. After 1873, the Danish monetary system was aligned with that of Norway and Sweden, with the "krone" or crown as the main currency. This currency was based on the gold standard. The new system was a decimal system (as opposed to one based on 12) and consisted of crowns and &#xF8;re. Prior to the reform, two systems, the "courant" and the "specie," based on a silver standard, were used. 

The "rigsdaler" used from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries was similar to the currency in use at the time in Holland, German and Sweden. The Danish currency system, first instituted in 1625, and reformed after the financial crisis in 1813, had the following equivalents: 
12 penning = 1 skilling
16 skilling = 1 mark
6 mark = 1 rigsdaler or daler (sometimes referred to in English as the "rixdollar")
8 mark = 1 krone
In 1873, the rigsdaler was set as equivalent to two crowns. 
The word "daler" is a shortened form of the name of a Czech silver coin, the Joachimstaler from 1518.

    <annotation>This short saying is a pun on the word "call," which can be used both to describe the call of a shepherd (or any other type of call) and a particular type of paid office, here the benefice of a minister. Jens delights in many of his stories in puns, double entendres, and other verbal dexterity. The statement also acts as a humorous lead-in to the next story.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens's story of the minister in Rold is a variant of a widely attested tale, ATU 922, "The Shepherd Substituting for the Clergyman Answers the King's Questions." Aarne and Thompson list forty-nine Danish variants of this tale alone (ATU 922). The best known scholarly treatment of this tale is Walter Anderson's Kaiser und Abt (1923, 182ff). In the folktale fair copy collection, one finds another variant of this tale from the immediate area placing Rold minister in the role of foolish minister (&#xC6;v.1361b told by Kirsten Kristensdatter, Aarestrup). The closeness of the variants suggests that the Rold minister was a local tradition dominant for the foolish minister.

     The "Blue maiden" was a much discussed torture device (Stevnsborg 1992). Feilberg offers the following description: "There were three steps up to the maiden; when the sinner stepped on the first step, she smiled; on the second step, she opened her arms; on the third she closed her arms around him and strangled him or cut his head off" (Feilberg 2, 43). It is closely related to the "Iron Maiden," the best known example of which was destroyed during the air raids in Nuremberg during World War II.

     The manuscript is somewhat confusing since BJK 3.43 is interpolated in the midst of the story. The manuscript is also remarkably spare, and Tang Kristensen fills out the narrative considerably in the published version.</annotation>

    <english_publication>The minister in Rold wrote over his door that he lived without sorrow or adversity. One time, the king came through there and when he saw that inscription he said to the minister that he was to come to an audience with him and answer three questions, otherwise, if he couldn&#x2019;t, he was to kiss the blue virgin. The first question was what the king&#x2019;s chair was worth, the second, what he himself was worth, and the third, what he was thinking. The minister was quite surprised by this and went about and was only half a person with worry. But then he falls into conversation with the town shepherd who said that if the minister would give him some new clothes and some traveling money, then he&#x2019;d travel over to Copenhagen and meet with the king in his stead. Yes, he&#x2019;d gladly do that and then the shepherd journeyed off. When he comes in to the king, the king is sitting on a gold chair. The king asks him first what the chair is worth. &#x201C;Oh, it isn&#x2019;t worth more than what a good May rain can pay,&#x201D; says the shepherd. &#x201C;Well then what am I worth?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, they paid thirty silver coins for our savior, so if you paid twenty-nine for your majesty, then you&#x2019;ve been well paid for.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;OK, then what am I thinking about?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, the king is thinking that you&#x2019;re talking to Rold Minister, but in fact it is their town shepherd.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s how he got out of it well.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The next two stories in Jens's repertoire (BJK 3.44 and BJK 3.45) play on the foolishness of the minister in Rold alluded to in the previous humorous statement (BJK 3.41). In this story, the parish clerk plays a prank on the minister, highlighting the perceived tension that existed between the parish clerk and the minister. The minister, caught off guard, loses his most important possession, first to the soup pot and then to the dog. The story also plays on the motif of the devil in dog form (Woods 1958), but this dog is hardly Satanic. 

     The minister's amusing sermon to the parish relies on the common formulation "falde til F&#xF8;je og Takke," [submit and be thankful], but adds the absurd proposition that God's words are found in a dog's behind, a literal representation of what had happened but utterly incomprehensible--in fact blasphemous--in the context of a sermon. In that sense, the Rold minister's statement is reminiscent of the minister who described the antics of a runaway cow during a funeral (JPP 1.03).

     This story is broken up in the manuscript, appearing unexpectedly after the episode in the preceding storyin which the shepherd agrees to stand in for the minister in Rold (BJK 3.42). It is likely that Jens digressed from his original story to tell this story, and then picked up with the shepherd confronting the king. The beginning of this story is not set off from the preceding in the manuscript, but after it ends, there is a short dash, before the other story begins once again.</annotation>

    <english_publication>Rold minister didn&#x2019;t know how the time went, and didn't remember when he was supposed to be in church. Then he figured out a system. He'd make himself a birch bundle each day while he went out there and worked on the farm, and when he had seven, then he knew that it was Sunday. The parish clerk discovers what was going on, and so he goes and steals one of the bundles from him. Since the minister counts his bundles every morning, he thinks that it is Saturday and it is actually Sunday. Now when he gets down to the alder meadow with the cattle and begins to cut away at the birch trees, the parish clerk begins ringing. He gets surprised and has to drop everything and runs home. He hurries into his vestments and gets his book under his arm. But he needed a little to eat before he goes up to the church, and since the girl was cooking cabbage, she has to ladle some out for him, he could stand there and swallow a bit. The dish was standing beside the cabbage pot and while he was slurping it up, his book fell into the pot. He fished it out again and then he put it on a three-legged stool. At that moment a hungry dog came and snapped it up, since it was soaked through with fat. When he got to the church, he said that they should submit and be thankful, since God&#x2019;s true words were in a dog&#x2019;s behind.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens's next story continues to focus on the unusual and foolish behavior of the Rold minister mentioned in previous stories (BJK 3.44). Here, the post officer uses the normal phrasing of the minister in legends of the would-be ghost (ML3005) when he confronts the prone figure of the priest. In those stories, the lack of response leads to the minister conjuring the farmhand. Here, the post officer with the same intentions as the minister in ML3005 to consign the devil to the realm of the dead takes aim with his rifle but the gun conveniently jams. The amusingly positive outcome is attributed to divine intervention.

     The second part of the story plays on the concept of the minister speaking directly to the minister. Here, the minister, apparently slow on the uptake, wonders to whom the Lord is speaking, as Per is a common name (short for Peder or Peter).

     Tang Kristensen provided a historical annotation in the published version, noting that P.T. Karmark was minister in Rold from 1721-1750. His successor was also named Karmark (S. P. Karmark), although it is unclear if there was a familial relationship between the two. By situating the stories far back in time, Jens reveals a startling degree of local historical knowledge, and diminishes the bite of the derision directed as the Rold minister in particular and ministers in general.</annotation>

    <annotation>The next series of stories in Jens's repertoire focus on the "Skalken fra Mjels" or the "Rogue from Mjels." The rogue's willingness to appear in court in lieu of the minister is reminiscent of the story of the Rold minister and the shepherd (BJK 3.42), while the accusation against the minister is a standard accusation of theft that ghosts and Satan often level at ministers during conjuring sessions (KMP 1.05; DS V 694).

     The story also plays on an increasingly litigious aspect of Danish society in the aftermath of the land and constitutional reforms. Personal property and personal initiative to prosecute torts had become concerns of people far down the social ladder; prior to these reforms, few people had any real or personal property to protect. The rogue's clever reply to the claimants, both in the first case and in the second case (against the minister), clearly form the narrative crux of these accounts. This emphasis on oratorical skill appears frequently in Jens's stories.

     The second part of the story dealing with the falling out between the minister and the rogue, and the subsequent court case, incorporates an element of sex--something that appears frequently in many of Jens's other stories and songs. The rogue's initial criticism of the minister and his stupidity, comparing him to the horse for slipping into a "hole", leads to their confrontation in court. There, the rogue plays the minister for a fool, relying again on double entendres and imprecise information to score a rhetorical victory.

     The recording in the manuscript is confusing. For the sake of readability, I have marked the section that actually appears at the end of the manuscript record in brackets. It is unclear why Tang Kristensen began writing half-way down the page (4107a). It is possible that Jens decided to explain the underlying cause for the libel case between the minister and the rogue by telling the story of the minister's seduction and then returning to the story of the case.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>The Rogue from Mjels was a farm owner who lived there. He saved their minister, when he was to pay a huge amount of money (stor Kapital). He'd attended the Latin school in Aalborg, and one time he'd gone into a restaurant and had eaten three eggs that he hadn't paid for. This was left unresolved until he was minister in Ferslev and a bill came for the three eggs... three chickens could have laid so many eggs ... and so on until it was a bill so big that the minister couldn't pay it. He had no idea what he should do, and was in really bad straits. He'd been summoned for it. Then the rogue says he could meet up for him and then he'd set things in order. The minister thought this was great. Travels off to Aalborg. He is supposed to appear at a certain time but he he doesn't, he waits a half hour longer. Is he the one who was to meet up for the minister. Yes, he was. Why did he wait so long? Yes, please excuse him, he had a barrel of boiled peas and he absolutely had to get them planted. "What? Cooked peas can't grow." "Oh yeah." They began reading up the case to him. "Permission to ask a question, weren't the eggs prepared, boiled or fried?" Yes, they were boiled. "You said that boiled peas couldn't grow, how could you get chicks from boiled eggs?" Yes, they had to admit that that couldn't happen. Well you're welcome to reach an agreement with the minister, because otherwise they'd have him to deal with. So they had to give money to the minister instead. Then a while passed and he and the minister were great friends, but then they had a falling out, him and the minister. But the rogue was the rogue and he made himself so deathly ill, and the minister was sent for to give him the last rites. Then the minister asks if he has something on his conscience and it would be for the best ... Yes he did, he had taken life from his first wife. Lord save us. Had he done anything else? Yes, he had screwed seven dogs to death. The minister heard him out. Then he got better, the rogue did, and then they were going to start their case. The rogue was a fine upstanding person and he'd [never hurt anyone. "What did you admit to me when you were sick?" Yes, he hadn't done anything to be ashamed over. The minister continued to prod him and then he says it. It was really bad weather and his wife was going to deliver, but they couldn't get a midwife, and so he did it himself. So that was the life he'd taken. Then there were these dogs. His dog had had seven puppies and they lay under the bed. Then he'd fucked his wife and the bottom of the bed had fallen out, and they had crushed all the puppies to death. That's what had happened. The minister wasn't supposed to make this public and so he lost his position because of that. He proved to the judge that the nag was wiser than the minister too and the judge agreed with him.] The minister had seduced one of his hired girls and had gotten into bad difficulties to avoid being called Father. But the next year he seduced two. The rogue had ridden down to the minister with rye for his bread (br&#xF8;drug), but he got too close to a water hole and his nag slips into it. The next year he was riding the same way on the same nag, and then he couldn't get near that hole and so he said that his nag was wiser than the minister and that was what he was suing him for and was mad about.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Skalken fra Mjels var en Gaardmand, som boede der. Han reddede en Gang deres Pr&#xE6;st, der var kommen i en slem Forlegenhed. Han havde i sin Tid gaaet i Latinskolen i Aalborg, og der var han kommen ind til en Spisev&#xE6;rt og havde spist tre &#xC6;g, som han ikke havde betalt. Det stod saa hen, til han var bleven Pr&#xE6;st i Ferslev. Da kom der en Regning til ham paa de tre &#xC6;g, og der stod, at der af de tre &#xC6;g kunde v&#xE6;re kommet tre Kyllinger, og de kunde have lagt saa mange &#xC6;g, og saadan blev de ved at stille det frem, til det blev en Regning saa stor, at Pr&#xE6;sten han kunde ikke betale den. Nu vidste han aldrig, hvad han skulde gj&#xF8;re, og var i en saadan Forlegenhed, for han blev jo st&#xE6;vnet for det. Da siger Skalken til ham en Dag, at han kunde m&#xF8;de for ham, saa skulde han nok gj&#xF8;re den Ting i Orden. Det syntes Pr&#xE6;sten grusselig godt om. Skalken rejser altsaa til Aalborg den bestemte Dag. Han skal m&#xF8;de til en vis Tid, men venter en halv Times Tid l&#xE6;ngere. Da han nu kommer ind, siger de, om det var &#xE9;n, der skulde m&#xF8;de for Pr&#xE6;sten. Ja, det var. Hvorfor han bej saa l&#xE6;nge? Ja, de maatte have ham undskyldt, han havde en T&#xF8;nde kogte &#xC6;rter, og dem skulde han absolut have saaet. "Hvad? kogte &#xC6;rter de kan jo ikke gro", og de begyndte at l&#xE6;se op for ham. "Mig Tilladelse at sp&#xF8;rge", siger han saa, "var de &#xC6;g ikke kogte eller stegte eller lavede til?" Jo, de var kogte. "De sagde, at kogte &#xC6;rter kunde ikke gro, hvordan kan der da blive Kyllinger af kogte &#xC6;g?" Ja, det maatte de tilstaa, der kunde heller ikke. Saa fik de v&#xE6;re saa god at gj&#xF8;re Forlig med Pr&#xE6;sten, sagde Skalken, for ellers fik de med ham at bestille. De maatte saa til at give Pr&#xE6;sten Penge i Stedet for at faa. Det stod nu hen en Tid, og han og Pr&#xE6;sten var store Venner. Men saa kom de i Ustand. Skalken var jo Skalken, og han gjorde sig saa d&#xF8;delig syg, og Pr&#xE6;sten blev hentet og skulde berette ham til D&#xF8;den. Saa sp&#xF8;rger Pr&#xE6;sten, om han havde noget paa Samvittigheden, for saa var det bedst, han fik den lettet og fortalte ham det. Ja, han havde, han havde taget Livet af hans f&#xF8;rste Kone. Gudbevares, det var da en skr&#xE6;kkelig Synd. Om han havde gjort mere? Ja, han havde p . . . . syv hunde ihjel. Se, Pr&#xE6;sten han h&#xF8;rte jo ud. "Ja, du er en forf&#xE6;rdelig Synder, du maa se at omvende dig, det er paa Tiden, hvis der da er Omvendelse for saadan en Synder." Saa kom han sig igjen, det gjorde Skalken, han havde jo slet ikke v&#xE6;ret syg. En Tid efter rider han ned til Pr&#xE6;sten med hans Br&#xF8;drug, men kom for n&#xE6;r til et V&#xE6;ldhul, og der slapper &#xD8;get i for ham. Aaret efter red han den samme Vej paa det samme &#xD8;g, og da kunde han ikke komme n&#xE6;r om ved det hul. Saa sagde han, at &#xD8;get var klogere end deres Pr&#xE6;st. Det fik Pr&#xE6;sten at h&#xF8;re, og saa sags&#xF8;gte han ham for det. Da de skal nu til at begynde deres Proces, saa siger Skalken, at han havde aldrig gjort ham nogen Fortr&#xE6;d eller sagt nogen L&#xF8;gn om ham. "Hvad har du da bekjendt for mig, da du var syg?" Ja, han havde ikke gjort noget, han beh&#xF8;vede at skamme sig ved. Pr&#xE6;sten bliver ved at praje ham, og han siger saa, hvordan det har sig.  Det var saa forf&#xE6;rdelig ondt Vejr, og hans Kone Skulde gj&#xF8;re Barsel, men de kunde ikke faa Jordemoder, og saa gjorde han det selv ud. Det var det Liv, han havde taget. Det var nu det, men saa begynder Pr&#xE6;sten at tale om den anden Forbrydelse, han havde begaaet. Hans hund havde faaet Syv hvalpe, og de laa under Sengen. Saa havde han en Nat ...... hans Kone, og da Slap Bunden af Sengen, og de havde klemt alle hvalpene ihjel. Saadan var det gaaet til. Saa maa Pr&#xE6;sten til at tage fat paa den Beskyldning, at hans gamle &#xD8;g var klogere end Pr&#xE6;sten. Ja, Skalken begynder saa med at fort&#xE6;lle, at han var saadan et oprigtigt Menneske, og nu var han da n&#xF8;dt til at fort&#xE6;lle det, som det var. Pr&#xE6;sten havde lokket en af hans piger og var kommen i en slem Forlegenhed for at blive fri for at kaldes Faaer. Men Aaret efter lokkede han Pigen anden Gang. Om Dommeren tykte saa ikke, han havde haft Ret i at sige, at Pr&#xE6;sten ikke var saa klog som &#xD8;get, da han var kommen i ..... anden Gang. Det maatte Dommeren give ham Ret i. Endelig vilde han sige, at det, Pr&#xE6;sten havde f&#xF8;rt frem for Retten, det var noget, han ellers ikke maatte aabenbare, og nu forlangte han, at Dommeren Skulde domme ham fra hans Embede for det. Det skete ogsaa, saa Skalken var ikke saa nem at tr&#xE6;kkes med.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The "Rogue from Mjels" was a farm owner who lived there in Mjels. One time he saved their minister, who&#x2019;d run into really bad difficulties. In his day he&#x2019;d attended the Latin school in Aalborg, and there he&#x2019;d gone into a restaurant and had eaten three eggs that he hadn&#x2019;t paid for. This was left unresolved until he was minister in Ferslev. Then a bill came to him for three eggs, and it said that from the three eggs there could have come three chickens, and they could have laid so many eggs, and they continued like that figuring forward, until it was a bill so big that the minister couldn&#x2019;t pay it. Now he had no idea what he should do, and was in really bad straits since he&#x2019;d been summoned for it. Then one day the rogue says to him that he&#x2019;d meet up for him and he&#x2019;d set things in order. The minister thought this was great. The rogue travels off to Aalborg on the appointed day. He is supposed to appear at a certain time but he waits a half hour longer. When he finally goes in, they ask if he was the one who was to meet up for the minister. Yes, he was. Why did he wait so long? Yes, please excuse him, he had a barrel of boiled peas and he absolutely had to get them planted. &#x201C;What? Cooked peas can&#x2019;t grow,&#x201D; and they began reading up the case to him. &#x201C;Permission to ask a question,&#x201D; he says then, &#x201C;weren&#x2019;t the eggs boiled or fried or otherwise prepared?&#x201D; Yes, they were boiled. &#x201C;You said that boiled peas couldn&#x2019;t grow, so how could you get chicks from boiled eggs?&#x201D; Yes, they had to admit that that couldn&#x2019;t happen. Well you&#x2019;re welcome to reach an agreement with the minister, said the rogue, because otherwise they&#x2019;d have him to deal with. So they had to give money to the minister instead of getting money from him. Then a while passed and he and the minister were great friends. But then they had a falling out. The rogue was the rogue and he made himself so deathly ill, and the minister was sent for to give him the last rites. Then the minister asks if he has something on his conscience and it would be for the best if he relieved his mind and told him. Yes he did, he had taken life from his first wife. Lord save us, that was a terrible sin. Had he done anything else? Yes, he had p... (pulet &#x2013;  screwed) seven dogs to death. You see the minister heard him out. &#x201C;Yes, you are a horrible sinner, you must see about turning your life around, it is about time, if there is to be a conversion of such a sinner.&#x201D; Then he got better, the rogue did, he hadn&#x2019;t been sick at all. A little later he rides down to the minister with rye for his bread, but he got too close to a watering hole and his nag slips into it. The next year he was riding the same way on the same nag, and then he couldn&#x2019;t get near that hole. Then he said that his nag was wiser than the minister. The minister heard that, and he sued him for slander over that. When they were about to start the case, the rogue says that he&#x2019;s never hurt him or told any lies about him. &#x201C;What did you admit to me when you were sick?&#x201D; Yes, he hadn&#x2019;t done anything to be ashamed over. The minister continued to prod him and then he told him how things were. It was really bad weather and his wife was going to deliver, but they couldn&#x2019;t get a midwife, and so he did it himself. That was the life he&#x2019;d taken. That was that, but then the minister starts talking about the other crime he had committed. His dog had had seven puppies and they lay under the bed. Then one night he&#x2019;d been screwing his wife and the bottom of the bed fell out, and they had crushed all the puppies to death. That&#x2019;s what had happened. Then the minister had to start in on the complaint that his old nag was wiser than the minister. Yes, the rogue begins to explain that he was a fine upstanding person, and now he had to tell it as it was. The minister had seduced one of his hired girls and had gotten into serious difficulties to avoid being called father. But the next year he seduced the girl a second time. If the judge didn&#x2019;t think then that he&#x2019;d been right to say that the minister wasn&#x2019;t as wise as the nag when he&#x2019;d gotten into the ..... (presumably hole, although this is edited from the ms) a second time. The judge had to agree with him. Finally he said that what the minister had brought before the court were things that he otherwise wasn&#x2019;t allowed to make public, and now he requested that the judge remove him from his position as minister because of that. That happened too, so the rogue wasn&#x2019;t an easy one to deal with.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens continues with stories of the rogue from Mjels mentioned in the previous story (BJK 3.46), comparing him in part to Satan, who is also wont to give people rides in his carriage (BJK 3.02). The story also includes an intriguing meta-narrative element, with the girl telling the rogue stories that she had heard about him.

    <annotation>Sand drifts were a threat to many Jutlandic villages, particularly in the north. Even though older maps do not make any clear annotation of an old town north of the parsonage in Torup (which is approximately a kilometer south of the village of Torup itself), there could well have been abandoned farms in the area. It is unclear if sand movements and drifts were common in the area. Perhaps the best known structure destroyed by drifting sand in Denmark is a church in Skagen that was closed in 1795 because it had become covered by drifting sand.</annotation>

    <annotation>The story plays on well known stories of treasure hunting, where the treasure disappears out of reach because someone talks. In this case, though, the man actually gets the treasure and the kettle in which it is held. But, as in other stories of interactions with the mound dwellers, their fortune appears as valueless. Here, there is no recourse to recover the lost treasure (as in some stories of midwife to the mound dwellers). Instead, he is left with the quite functional consolation prize of the coffee pot.
     In the published version, Tang Kristensen eliminated the frame narrative, in which a junk peddler told of the treasure hunter. He also deleted the reference to swearing, thus rendering the story incomplete.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A junk peddler said that a man from his district (&#xC5;by) was digging on a mound that he had on his field and he wanted to get rid of and he found a copper kettle. "Wow, I've found," boy could he swear, "a kettle full of money." But when he went to touch it, it was just shit and dung. He shouldn't have talked, then it would have been money.

    <annotation>This short account of the properties of rowan (mountain ash) continues the previous record. Oddly, it is not included in Tang Kristensen's published collections. "Flying Rowan" is considered to be particularly powerful since it does not grow out of the ground. Because it is not connected to the ground, witches do not have any power over it (Feilberg 1977 vol. 1, 320). A "Flying Rowan" tree or shrub grows from a rowan seed deposited by a bird or the wind in a crack in a wall, or in a fork or hollow in a tree. </annotation>

    <annotation>In this fairly typical story of curse / counter-curse, the witch has caused the farm to lose animals, and the witch master, or cunning man, is called to restore (economic) order. The farmhand reads the small note presumably with the expectation of finding something incomprehensible or sufficiently magical in nature but instead finds a mundane statement about animal care. Jens Ilder, as with the rest of the cunning folk to whom Jens refers, is not mentioned in R&#xF8;rbye's study of cunning folk.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens's story reflects many of the attitudes toward assistance to the poor, wanderers and beggars that animated much of the local political life of the time. There was a widespread belief in a free rider problem--that some people were using assistance to the poor because of their own unwillingness, and not inability, to work (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940). Similarly, there was a widespread sentiment that the poor were not sufficiently thankful for the assistance they received. Jens Smed's response--to beat the ungrateful beggar--reflects in short order the frustration that many smallholders felt over the requirement that they contribute, through taxation, to the support of the poor.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens's second story about the woman from Nysum also plays on the stories of wanderers (the first story appears as BJK 4.12). In this story, an old man craftily sneaks into the inn and steals not only alcohol but money as well. It is unclear if the old man is a vagabond or not, although his hiding place in the communal malt house, his thievery and the performance context, coming after two short stories of ungrateful beggars, seem to suggest this.

    <english_publication>My mother&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s father was from Nysum Inn and had been off serving the king for eleven years. He was called Jens Smed. Then his mother dreamed that he was going to come home. She sat down one evening and began carding. Her husband said to her, &#x201C;What, aren&#x2019;t you going to bed?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;No,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll sit here until our Jens comes home.&#x201D; He also came that same night, and they hadn&#x2019;t heard from him in all those years, since they couldn&#x2019;t write in those days.
     Yes, that innkeeper&#x2019;s wife was a good dreamer. One time, some of her coins had disappeared, she needed some to give people change with when they bought a half pint at her place. Then she asks her husband if he&#x2019;d taken her coins. He said that he hadn&#x2019;t taken any. But that night she dreamed how it had happened. One day during the harvest she&#x2019;d gone out to gather, an old man came in through the malt house, opened the kitchen door and went into the room. The innkeeper saw him, though, and followed behind him in stocking feet and wanted to see what he was doing. First he drank from one bottle, and then another, and then another. Finally he took some of the coins when he left, but he was caught by the innkeeper when he left. He shoved him around a bit, took the money from him and let him go. See, she&#x2019;d dreamed that, and now the innkeeper had to admit it, he didn&#x2019;t want to tell her about it before.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens turns from the stories of portentous dreams to his own experiences, confirming that such dreams can come true. It is somewhat surprising that this story is separated from the preceding in Tang Kristensen's published collections, as the preceding story stands as the impetus for its performance and, similarly, this story confirms the validity of the preceding. It is worth noting that Jens's wife was known in the local community for being gifted with second sight and having portentous dreams.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens tells a well known story about the soul out wandering as a mouse (ML4000). It follows directly on his stories and his own experiences of portentous dreams. In this variant, the wanderings of the mouse reveal the location of a buried treasure. Interestingly, and unlike many other stories of buried treasure, the farmhand who digs for the treasure is successful in his quest. Success in the treasure hunt may be related to earlier versions of this story that were known in Scandinavia (Chesnutt 1991).

    The story is first attested in the writings of Paul the Deacon [Paulus Diaconus] from the eighth century. In his writings, he recounts the story of Guntram, the Frankish king of Burgundy and Orl&#xE9;ans, (b.525-d.592). Variants of this story are accordingly referred to as the "Guntram legend" (Chesnutt 1991). In the Guntram legend, the king leaves his body as a snake, and his squire helps him cross a small stream by laying down his sword. The snake slithers into a hole and when the king awakens, he says he has dreamed of a magnificent treasure. When the hill is excavated, they discover a remarkable treasure--somewhat surprising given the snake's eye view that otherwise distorts the environment. Helinand of Froidmont (b.1160-d.1229) relates another variant of the story in his Chronicon (1211-1223), without the discovery of treasure. The animal in that story is a small white weasel-like creature.

     Jens's variant maintains the motif of the companion's assistance in crossing the stream, and the discovery of the treasure. The soul takes the form of the tradition dominant mouse, and the treasure is sufficiently modest in keeping with the questions of perspective and scale attributed to the mouse (DS II G 102).

     Christiansen notes that the story is widely attested, including a variant from Japan (Christiansen 1992, 47). In some Danish variants, the mouse returns and the farmhand is able to tell the news from home (DS II G 107), a phenomenon reminiscent of stories of Odin and his two ravens who keep him apprised of happenings in the world. In another variant, the farmhand's companion prevents the mouse from returning into the body of the sleeping farmhand, resulting in his death (DS II G 106).</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens continues with stories of portentous dreams and, somewhat unusually, successful treasure hunts. In these successful treasure hunt stories, such as this one and the preceding (BJK 4.17), the original hunter often reveals the location of his quest to an interlocutor, but gives up on the search himself. The interlocutor then acts on this information and recovers the treasure.

     Tang Kristensen did not publish this account. The account is somewhat unusual for Jens, because it departs from his usual intense focus on local history and geography. The chance encounter between the farmhand and the successful treasure hunter takes place in the center of Copenhagen on H&#xF8;jbro. It is unclear where in Copenhagen Trondal and Trondals Mark were located, if they existed at all.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens conflates several aspects of various stories in a legend that reflects aspects of class and perceived threat. The poor farmer fortunately recovers a treasure hidden presumably by robbers who pose a clear threat to the local economy (hence all the money). The man's discovery of the treasure is implicitly connected to his appeal to god, and the bargain that he strikes. When he begins the process of building the church--one of the few things that people can successfully do with found treasure since it represents a return of wealth to the community--he is approached by a wealthy local. The rich man, despite his promise, fails to build the other parts of the church, revealing the lack of trustworthiness of the wealthy. The rich man's failure to make good on his promise to build the bell tower potentially indicates a link between the rich man and the devil since, through his inaction, he damages the church. These actions are then used as part of an etiological tag to explain an unusual phenomenon in the man-made environment.

     Suldrup church is six and a half kilometers north west of Ersted. Photographs of the church reveal that the bell tower was not completed initially. In 1944, a half timber spire was added to the otherwise foreshortened tower.</annotation>

When he got home he began leveling the place where Suldrup church stands. A rich man in the town said, "What are you doing here? Why are you leveling this place?."-- "I think I'll build a church, it's so far for us to church." -- "Well, if you build the church, then I'll put up the tower, the altar and the choir."

    <annotation>Jens's cunning man, Jens Ilder, is able to stave off the incompetent attack directed at him by the girl. The girl's use of the witch's butter should be understood in the context of stories about the witch's milking and their theft from the community. The girl uses both contagious and sympathetic magic to inflict her curse. In other variants, "heksefedt" [witch's fat] is used to inflict the curse (DS VII 296); cunning folk are often called to counteract the effects of the curse. Jens Ilder counters the curse with the rifle shot, and the girl eventually submits to his request, in exchange for being cured. 

     Most witches who are shot are in the shape of a hare. The witch usually suffers a broken arm or leg (DS VII 268), and the cunning person does not offer to cure them. In this story, Jens Ilder seems to take into consideration that the girl does not herself appear to be a witch.

     St. Hans eve is widely attested as the time when the witches ride to their Sabbath. There does not seem to be consensus in tradition concerning the specific day on which witches churn their butter.</annotation>

    <annotation>Disturbing mound dwellers can lead to unusual calamity. Kold-Jens relies on his own personal experience with a piece of rope to influence the actions of his successors. The story is not so much about a threat made good as it is about potential threat, one informed by other stories of unfortunate interactions with mound dwellers. 

     Mounds were often leveled during the nineteenth century in a bid to increase arable land and for marl. Marl, coupled to better crop rotation policies, and improved drainage radically changed the yield of Danish fields up through the latter decades of the century (Bj&#xF8;rn and Dahlerup 1988, vol. 3).

     There are several prominent mounds in the area south of Ersted, although none of them are labeled Persh&#xF8;j on any maps. Local names for topographic features often did not make it on to maps, and Jens reveals here more of his knowledge of the topography of the immediate area.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is a variant of the widely attested legend of the mound dwellers' baking (KMP 1.20; DS I 381 and 382). In Jens' variant, the man is given bread--here described as flatbread, a treat usually given to children--and beer in return for repairing the peel-board. The beer is an unusual element, since the payment in variants of this story usually relates to the repaired baking implement. The man's invocation of Christian symbolism is understandable, yet it undermines the tit-for-tat nature of the barter arrangement--and the mound dweller points this transgression out to the man. Jens does not include any information on the outcome of eating the mound dweller's food, although presumably the outcome was not noteworthy (neither remarkably good nor remarkably bad). Instead, Jens focuses on the similarity and compatibility between the human world and the world of the mound dwellers.

The plow beam is the part of the plow that connects the plow handle to the plow share.</annotation>

Det var alts&#xE5; siden marken blev udskift, og hendes fader pl&#xF6;jede imod den. S&#xE5; viste han hans karl ud for at skulle kaste en rende omkring den, men da var den s&#xE5; forf&#xE6;rdelig stor, at fire heste kunde ikke tr&#xE6;kke den derfra, og han havde endda fire gode heste og vilde gj&#xE6;rne have haft den hjem til g&#xE5;rden, den kunde have lukket (lujt) et godt stykke p&#xE5; kringg&#xE5;rdsdiget.

Der var noget lyng omkring ved Bavnh&#xF6;j den gang, og det var ved at br&#xE6;kke op at min bedstefader st&#xF6;dte p&#xE5; den. Da karlen havde f&#xE5;et jorden kastet af den, var der s&#xE5; mange oph&#xF6;jede bogstaver p&#xE5; den, de var ikke huggede ned i den, men var ligesom klistrede p&#xE5;.

    <english_publication>On &#xC5;restrup field northwest of the church there&#x2019;s a rune stone, it's in the third field south of Bavnh&#xF8;j, that&#x2019;s what my mother said, she was born in 1792 and she wasn&#x2019;t more than a little girl when they found it. It was after the fields had been reapportioned and her father plowed into it. Then he got his farmhand out there to help him dig a ditch around it, but it was so big that four horses couldn&#x2019;t pull it up, and he had four good horses too and really wanted to bring it back to the farm, it could have closed up a big part of the stone wall around the farm. But when he realizes that it's too big to freight it off, they decide to bury it. Then they had to dig a hole below it that was big enough for them to push it in, and it had to be deep enough that they could plow over it; that wasn&#x2019;t too hard because it turned out there was some beautiful white sand there that was easy to dig. There was some heather near Bavnh&#xF8;j at that time, and it was starting to break up when my father ran into it. When the farmhand had gotten it dug out there were all sorts of raised letters on it, they weren&#x2019;t carved into it, more like they&#x2019;d been glued onto it. It was probably a stone that had stood over on Bavnh&#xF8;j in the old days. But it isn&#x2019;t so easy to find it again, because the fields have been turned completely around since that time.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens returns to the realm of folk remedies with this short description. Toothache was a significant worry in rural Denmark. Accordingly, anything that could stave off a toothache was likely to be well known and commonly practiced. Putting a dung beetle in one's mouth is hardly appetizing and conjures images of television shows such as Fear Factor. H.C. Andersen wrote perhaps the best account of the horror of the toothache in his short story "Tante Tandpine" (Auntie Toothache). The boy in that story dies from his abscessed tooth.

     This particular remedy remained unpublished. Other remedies for toothache include sucking on cemetery mud (DS IV 2015), or other more involved rituals with horseshoe nails (DS IV 2016) or other sharp sticks (DS IV 2018)--a form of sympathetic magic.</annotation>

    <annotation>Although this particular story is not as obscene as some of Jens's other stories, it does have obscene elements, particularly with the girl's response to the sixth commandment. The implication in her response to the fourth commandment is that her father was a serious criminal, likely a murderer, and that her mother was a witch (hence the burning). The order of the ten commandments follows that in Martin Luther's small catechism, and is based on Deuteronomy 5:6-21. Other versions of the commandments can be found in Exodus 20:2-17 and Exodus 34:12-26. The first volume of Kuri&#xF8;se Overh&#xF8;ringer does not number the stories. Accordingly, it can be difficult to find the proper story--this story appears on pp. 51-52, under the rubric, Pigen og de ti Bud [The Girl and the Ten Commandments].</annotation>

Fourth commandment. The one was hung and the other burned, and that wasn't worth any honor. Fifth commandment, do not kill. Didn't do that either, that's why they crawled on her back like sheep ticks. Sixth commandment, neither, because she saw them during the day, and they wouldn't get on top of her at night. Seventh commandment. No she didn't like to walk much during the day and not at all at night, and so she couldn't steal. Eighth commandment. False witness. She was pretty much sure to not be accused of that, since no one considered what she said worth much, she never came places like that. Ninth commandment. No wasn't so envious, as long as she could get some shelter to crawl in at night and if she couldn't herself, she'd be like the other beggars and ask for lodgings. The tenth commandment. She didn't like that either, as long as she had enough to eat for one sitting, she didn't want any more until she got hungry again.</english_manuscript>

    <english_publication>A minister was catechizing with the youngsters on the church floor. Then a girl was to read the first commandment, and the minister asks, if she didn&#x2019;t have any false gods. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a little bit like ours and not at all like the foreigners.&#x201D; Then she was to read the second commandment. &#x201C;Do you take God&#x2019;s name in vain?&#x201D; No, she didn&#x2019;t do that either, because she never mentioned him. Then she reads the third commandment. &#x201C;Do you honor the Sabbath as a rest day?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yeah, I don&#x2019;t want to do much on the regular days and nothing on the holy days.&#x201D; Then she recited the fourth commandment. &#x201C;Do you honor your father and mother?&#x201D; &#x201C;No, they weren&#x2019;t worth honoring, since the one was hung and the other was burned.&#x201D; Then she read the fifth commandment. &#x201C;Haven&#x2019;t you ever killed anyone?&#x201D; &#x201C;No, and I won&#x2019;t either, and that&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re crawling around on my back like sheep ticks.&#x201D; Then it was the sixth commandment, had she sinned against that. &#x201C;No, those who see me during the day don&#x2019;t want to have anything to do with me at night.&#x201D; Then she read the seventh commandment. Hadn&#x2019;t she stolen anything? &#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t like to go places during the day, and certainly not at night, and so I can&#x2019;t steal.&#x201D; Then came the eighth commandment. Hadn&#x2019;t she ever borne false witness. No, she&#x2019;d avoided that, she never went places where you had to witness, because no one considered what she said worth much. Next she read the ninth commandment. Hadn&#x2019;t she ever coveted her neighbor&#x2019;s house? No, she wasn&#x2019;t that envious, as long as she could get some shelter to crawl in at night and if she couldn&#x2019;t, then she did what the other beggars did and asked for lodgings. Finally, the tenth commandment came.

    <english_publication>Jens Kristensen (in daily speech, called Bitte-Jens) was born the third of June 1825 in Ersted town. His mother was from &#xC5;restrup but his father was from Tveden. He has always lived here in the area, and he was only eight or nine years old when he had to start helping his father drill out clogs. His father was a clog maker and he has always lived off of doing that. When he got strong enough to handle it, Jens worked during harvest time with the harvest work. He took part in the war of 1848 and lived for many years in a house in Ersted, that is where I visited him, and five or six years ago he moved to the northwest of &#xC5;restrup to Hovbakhusene (Hovbaks houses). His father owned but a small house with one cow and five or six sheep. He learned his ballads from his mother, but she sang them all to one melody. In contrast, the father was a good singer and he learned the melodies from him. He also knew some ballads. Jens has sung many a ballad with Johan Pingel, who was first a road worker and later a railroad guard over in Ellidsh&#xF8;j. Jens calls everything that he tells a bunch of nonsense and not worth listening to, but no shame, he does not mean anything with it. His wife does not like all this old rubbish, and he does not like to open up in her presence. Luckily, she goes off to the neighbors with regularity. He is well attuned to the old mindset and the way the old people lived and he tells about it eagerly.
      I have also been out to Johan Pingel, but regrettably he has forgotten far too much.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's story encapsulates many of the conflicting views of the rural poor at the end of the nineteenth century. On the one hand, there was great suspicion that many of the poor were free riders, getting something for nothing. On the other hand, there was a strong movement against the earlier, paternalistic poverty assistance programs that robbed the recipients of their dignity and their rights as citizens.

     That the minister is selling grain to the poor seems a bit unusual, as one of the minister's duties was to distribute assistance to the poor. The administration of assistance to the poor was, for the first half of the century, a direct responsibility of the minister. Many communities chose to provide assistance in kind, handing out specified amounts of grain on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, rather than give cash. With the reforms to the laws governing local administration in 1867, the administration of these services was assumed by the local parish council.

     The minister's sale of grain may fall outside official public assistance to the poor and may simply be part of his own attempts to make a living. All parsonage's had land attached to them, and the minister was expected to supplement his income with the produce from his land. Here, the minister can combine entrepreneurship with Christian charity.

     Tang Kristensen provided an annotation to the story, identifying the minister as Hr. Otto Rafn, minister in Harridslev from 1796-1821, a time when local assistance to the poor was handled by the minister.</annotation>

    <annotation>The witch in animal form is a well known motif in Danish tradition. In most cases, the witch takes the shape of a hare (DS VII 106). The witch as fox is a bit unusual, but the fox's actions are not: here she attacks the animals on the farm and kills them. One of the strategies of combating a witch is to shoot her with a silver bullet, or something else made out of silver; buttons are commonly attested (DS VII 268). Ironically, the main character in the story, the man from T&#xF8;rslev, is the local folk healer, and the witch's son is forced to ask him for the cure for his mother's ailment. Not surprisingly, given the damage the witch has done to the folk healer's farm, he demurs and the witch dies.

     Hunting for foxes would have been a risky undertaking for most people, since the hunting rights to forests were reserved by the large land owners or the Crown. While the use of hunting blinds was common practice, it is not clear whether rotting animal carcasses were normally used as lures and blinds.

     Jens Peter brings the account into his own immediate sphere, pointing out that he knew the son of the injured witch.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A man in Torslev kept himself occupied with curing things that were bewitched. He had a drag (a carcass that he dragged from one place to another) and he wanted to use it to shoot foxes. As he was watching it, a fox came and started to gnaw on the carcass. He shot, but it ran away. He goes into the house to reload while the carcass lay there behind the barn. There was some brushwood (alder, oak and all sorts of trees and bushes) there close to the farm. The fox ran down into the bushes while the man was inside. When he comes out again, the fox is gnawing again. He shoots another time, but it was the same story, it didn't get hurt. Then he's going to load a third time and he goes in to his wife and says, "Now I've shot a second time in vain, but I won't a third time." Then he took a silver button and loaded it with that and shot. But while he was inside loading, there was a huge ruckus in the cow barn. When he came out, the fox was gnawing again. Now when he shoots, it screams and it is wounded. Then he jumps out of his hiding place and he gets so close to it he can see that it has turned into a hag with a red skirt over her, and her one thigh had been shot to pieces. The next morning her son comes and asks the man to give him a remedy for the woman, she'd broken her thigh and that was the marrow of the right leg of the drag. But the man answered, "If you want it, then you can take it yourself." But they couldn't take it and she wound up staying in bed, and she lay there for an entire year before she died. I knew the son who went to get the remedy. When the man had shot the hag and gone back and went into the cow barn to see what had happened, he found that two of his calves lay there dead. Their necks had been wrung, and she'd been in to do that after he'd shot the second time. She was from Skjern in Torslev parish.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's humorous story reflects the tensions that inform the relationships between the minister and the parish clerk and between the minister and the parishioners. The humor in the story relies on the obvious disconnect between the minister's description of the actions of a runaway cow, and the mourners' impression that he is describing the journey of the soul of the dearly departed. The punch line plays on the expression, "nu rejser hun ad helvede til," which can mean literally, "Now she journey's off to hell" or, more figuratively and descriptively, "Now she takes off running like hellfire." The word "kirkegaard" literally means churchyard but, as all Danish churches are surrounded by their cemeteries, it can also be translated as cemetery.</annotation>

    <annotation>St&#xF8;v-Karen, one of the poor people in the parish, shows herself to be an overt threat to the well-being of the farm. Her request for milk borders on begging which, according to the reforms to the poverty assistance laws in 1803, was strictly forbidden. On the other hand, poverty assistance, in the form of in kind almisse (alms), were an important part of the support for the poor, and many poor people did receive milk from farmers throughout the parish, either as part of an agreement with the parish poverty administration, or through private agreement (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940, 316). Karen's request for milk can be read as a symbolic representation of the ongoing request for support of the poor that many smallholders and farmers found to be a significant economic burden. The refusal to give St&#xF8;v-Karen milk is explained in a later telling of this story: the husband will only eat milk-fed veal (JPP 4.14). The refusal is not based on the need to keep the farm functioning well, but rather to provide a luxury to the farm owner while the poor go hungry (or in this case, without milk).

     St&#xF8;v-Karen, whose nickname means "Dust Karen," acts the part of a witch in this story. In other stories, she is referred to as a cunning woman (JPP 1.06) (R&#xF8;rbye 1976; Tangherlini 2000). Her reaction to the initial refusal--bewitching the new calf so that it jumps about the barn--is extreme, and the death of the calf results in a far greater economic burden than her request for milk. Bewitching cows, or otherwise hurting the livestock, is a common antic of witches (DS VII 1179 and 1183). 

     The arrogance that Karen exhibits when she returns to the farm to collect milk is evident in the pitcher that she brings with her. While many poor might ask for a small pot of milk, Karen intends to walk off with an entire milk can, far more than a single person could hope to use before it would spoil, and reminiscent of the excessive supernatural milking described in other legends of witches (DS VII 591 and 592).

     The farmer decides to confront the witch directly and beat her, as opposed to appealing to another intermediary such as a cunning person (DS VII 1180) or a minister (DS VII 574), strategies which tend to be effective, at least in narrative tradition (Tangherlini 1999). Not all ministers were willing to act as mediators (DS VII 176). The threat is not successfully mediated in this story and ultimately the farmer acquiesces to Karen's demands in an attempt to keep her witchcraft at bay. Her ability to change shape, in this case into a dark bird of prey, confirms that she is a witch.

     After the rise of the collective dairies in the 1880s, many of the poor found that they no longer could count on getting milk from local farmers, as the dairies collected the milk each morning. In the seven short years following the establishment of the first cooperative dairy in 1882, six hundred additional cooperative dairies were established, primarily in Jutland. The result was that there was little or no excess milk production for the poor (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940, 316).

     Tang Kristensen reversed the order of certain phrases in the story's orientation in the published version. He also added the tag that Jens Peter's mother was at the farm when the episode with the calf occurred, a tag that actually appears on page 6193a at the end of a story about some sheep that had disappeared (JPP 1.06).</annotation>

    <annotation>The accusation of witchcraft in this story aims at the highest levels of local society, and Jens Peter no doubt takes pleasure in the humiliation associated with the revelation of the innkeeper's wife as a witch. Skytte-Kr&#xE6;n [Hunter Christian] is likely of much humbler origins than the merchant and innkeeper. He is quite possibly a cunning man, given both his nickname and the role he plays in this story (DS VII 144).

    In related stories, manor lords are accused of having a pact with Satan (BJK 1.15; PJ 3.08).  There are also many stories in which the minister's wife's is revealed to be a witch (DS VII 149). In all these cases, the goal is to link the economically well-off or the politically powerful with the devil and, in so doing, undermine the legitimacy of their social and economic standing.

     The accusation of witchcraft lost most legal power by the nineteenth century. By 1866 it was no longer possible to try someone in court for witchcraft (Johansen 1991, 25; Tangherlini 2000). The standard for proving an accusation of witchcraft was generally quite high, even during the seventeenth century when witchcraft trials were at a peak (Tangherlini 2000; Johansen 1991; Henningsen 1975). Changing shape from dog to human and back would likely have reached that standard. The black dog is a common shape for the devil and, given the close connection between the devil and witches, it is not hard to imagine a witch in dog form (Woods 1959; Valk 2001). Kristen Nielsen from Mosehuse, for example, also tells a variant in which the witch appears as a dog (DS VII 144). Otherwise, common animal shapes for the witch to assume are cats and hares (DS VII 141 and 145).

     The power of naming as a form of control over the supernatural is a widely attested belief. Naming the witch is closely linked to other stories in which the witch's identity is brought to light (DS VII 149). In numerous other stories, naming the witch leads to the same type of transformation found in this story. </annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter probes the boundaries between the cunning woman and the witch in this legend. St&#xF8;v-Karen straddles this thin line. In some stories she is maliciously inclined toward the community (a witch), and in other stories, she is a clear protector of the community and its economic interests (a cunning person). 

     In this account, St&#xF8;v-Karen is clearly working in the interests of the community. With her bell, she is able to "show again," a skill of the cunning folk (KMP 1.56 and 1.57; AMJ 1.06 and 2.07). Although the sheep have not been stolen, but rather simply strayed, having them returned is of considerable importance. In another variant, St&#xF8;v-Karen indicates that she is helping out because she likes the shepherd boy (JPP 4.14).

     This variant was not published. Instead, Tang Kristensen published a more elaborate series of stories about St&#xF8;v-Karen that he collected from Jens Peter when he visited him for the fourth time (JPP 4.14). In the coda, Jens Peter connects this story to his earlier story about the bewitched calf (JPP 1.04). Interestingly, Tang Kristensen included the statement about Jens's mother being present in the published version of JPP 1.04.

     The location of Vugdrup (Vogdrup) is unclear. It might be the name of a farm, or of a small grouping of houses that later disappeared after the sale or dissolution of the small holdings.</annotation>

    <annotation>The story of the would-be ghost is attested throughout Scandinavia (Christiansen 1958). Ghosts in the cemetery need to be conjured back into the ground, as they threaten to disrupt the world of the living. In a Lutheran accommodation of folk belief surrounding ghosts, ghosts were linked to manifestations of Satan (Tangherlini 1998). There could hardly be a more threatening figure than Satan in a Lutheran community, and one of the most common strategies for dealing with him was to call for the minister (Tangherlini 1998).

     Kathleen Stokker links this story to questions about the power of the minister, confession and salvation, focusing particularly on the "Black Book minister" of Norwegian tradition (Stokker 1992). She proposes that the minister is essentially powerless to stop the farmhand from sinking, and resorts to confession and extreme unction to at least guarantee the young man salvation. An alternate reading of these stories is less supportive of the minister: if he is powerful enough to conjure the young man, he should be powerful enough to unconjure him as it were. Instead, he continues with the conjuring--and effective burial--as a form of extreme punishment.

      The resolution of this story is stark--the farmhand is dead and the minister's wife has gone mad. So, while the farmhand intended only to restore the minister to the parsonage (and his wife) at night where under all other circumstances he rightfully belonged, his actions lead to a horrific dissolution of the minister's family.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter is fascinated by stories in which the devil, or one of his closely related spirits such as witches or ghosts, appears as a black dog. In this story, the guilty haunt returns as a dog and wreaks havoc on the farm (Pentik&#xE4;inen 1969). The desire to "take it with you" when you die comes across clearly here. 

     Eight hundred daler was a significant sum of money and would have represented a considerable estate for the wife and, presumably, her children. In most stories of ghosts that haunt for hidden money, the amounts are much more humble (DS V 1002). Usually, it is the owner who has hidden the money (DS V 1007), and he or she haunts to reveal its location. It makes little sense that the wife agrees to hide the money in the casket for her husband. Taking the money out of the household and local economy could hardly have been a good thing, and might account in part for the clear prohibition against hiding money in caskets. When he discovers the hidden money, the wise minister, Master Nielsen, insists on removing it, returning it to the wife and, by extension, the local economy. The discovery of the money prior to the man's burial, and his subsequent haunting because of that, distinguishes this story from other stories about haunts who return as solicitous haunts to reveal the location of money (DS V 972; Pentik&#xE4;inen 1969). The haunt in this story is hardly solicitous, appearing to reclaim his fortune rather than give it away. The dog's rampage through the farm is nearly as destructive as the man's attempt to take the money with him.

     The question also arises as to how the man had acquired this small fortune--the implication, given his return in the form of a destructive, black dog (read Satan) is that the money represents ill-gotten gains. Consequently, the haunt is not an innocent, solicitous haunt, but rather a guilty haunt; accordingly, it is far more dangerous to the community. 

     The minister confronts the haunt and forcibly conjures him down at a boundary zone, in this case the mill dam. Such conjuring, outside the bounds of the consecrated grounds of the church, is generally reserved for the devil and guilty haunts (DS IV 691).</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter concludes his session with Tang Kristensen on a pessimistic note with this legend of a nearly failed conjuring. Again, the haunt appears in the guise of a black dog (Woods 1959). The minister protects the children and then brings the dog outside to be conjured. Although he is successful, the conjuring leaves its mark on him (Tangherlini 1998). 

     In his story, Jens Peter engages in a bit of a rhetorical twist: the children promise not to say anything, but do so anyway. People then tell their stories to each other, keeping the minister out of the loop. This meta-performative remark describes a channel of communication in the parish where the minister, despite his centrality, was unaware of what the parishioners were talking about.

     Tang Kristensen added an annotation in the published version identifying Hr. Knud Schott Deichmann as the minister in Torslev from 1792-1823.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a minister in Torslev who was called Deichmann. He used to read to the confirmation candidates out on the church floor. One day as he was reading, a big black dog came in to the church. He kept pushing the children so they all wound up in the choir loft and the dog followed along behind. But then the minister left the church and the dog followed, but the children stayed inside. Then he was outside for half an hour and then he came back inside again. He was so changed then that the children didn't recognize him. Then the minister says to them that if when they got home they talked about what had happened in the church that day then they wouldn't be confirmed by him.

    <annotation>Stories of ambushes in wooded, hilly areas are widely attested. Some of the attacks are successful (DS IV 1467), and some not (DS IV 1478). In these stories, groups of robbers are frequently described as having dens from where they can monitor activity on the road through the use of a primitive alarm (DS IV 1447 and 1449).

     The horse dealer probably feels that the innkeeper's warning is suspect, since other stories attest to the villainy of larcenous innkeepers (DS IV 1376 and JPP 2.14). 

     The horse dealer's escape from the robber is not unusual, and Jens Peter's next story continues in the same vein (JPP 2.02). Although the robbery is initially successful, the horse dealer is able to appeal for help from the local manor farm's huntsman. The thief is killed and the money recovered--essentially reestablishing the economic order that was in peril at the beginning of the story. Because robbers often worked in groups, the inability to further question the robber implies a continuing threat there in the woods.

     The robber's use of the long knife relates him to another famous Danish thief, Jens Langkniv [Longknife] who, in some stories, appears as a Danish Robin Hood (DS IV 1466) (Jensen 1993). Langkniv was an alias of Jens Olesen who was the subject of numerous legends, a novel by Jeppe Aakj&#xE6;r (1915), and a film in the 1940s directed by Per Knutzon and Peter Lind (considered by some film critics to be among the very worst films ever made).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a horse dealer who came from the south over the fjord and wanted to go to market down here. He arrived at an inn which is called Langbro (Long Bridge) Inn north of Sundby--at the time the road went over Jerslev bridge. Then the innkeeper said--he'd sat down inside and was having a bite to eat: "It's not worth it, leaving here tonight. It's a mighty thick weather, and a guy we don't trust too well just left here." "Well," answers the horse dealer, he was pretty well armed and had two good pistols. He'd told him, the horse dealer, that he had 4000 rigsdaler on him that he was going to go down and buy horses with and the robber had heard that. Then he leaves. When he got down to the &#xD8;stbj&#xE6;rg hills east of Tylstrup--that's where the road went through--there was a woods which he also had to go through and in there just next to the road there was a dale, which was called Tyrens (the Bull's) dale. The robber lived there and he had a den along with ropes across the road with a bell down in the den so he could hear when somebody traveled along the road. The robber comes at him and takes the money from him along with a big white homespun sweater like the ones they used in the olden days with big silver buttons on it. He shot his pistols well enough, but didn't hit him. The man fled when he got away from the thief and arrived at Gammel-Vr&#xE5;, where he got the huntsman to come with him. He told him what had happened and then he armed himself. When they got down into the dale, the robber was sitting down and had spread the homespun sweater out and was counting the money. The huntsman yells to him to give himself up otherwise he'd shoot. But the robber jumped up and threw his long knife, the blade of which was a foot long, and he wanted to hit the huntsman; but he didn't hit him but hit the saddle just in front of him instead and it stuck there. Then he shot him immediately, that's how mad he was. But he regretted it as long as he lived that he had to shoot him on the spot because they got no more information from him. My grandfather worked as the coachman at Gammel-Vr&#xE5; and he knew the huntsman, so this really had happened. A lot of people were plundered there at that spot.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Many legends attest to the presence of robbers in the &#xD8;stbjerg hills. The soldier stands as a clear representative of both the peasant class and the protection of the nation from outside threat. Not surprisingly, when he finds himself at the center of an ambush, he is able to defeat his attackers, despite overwhelming odds.

     The figure of the soldier is most commonly interpreted as a protector of the country. This notion had considerable currency in the aftermath of the Danish victories in the Three Years War and the valiant defense put up during the defeats in 1867. But in this story, the soldier plays a different role, protecting the economic fortunes of a single farmer, and by extension, the entire peasant class, rather than protecting the country. 

     The amputation of the robber's finger is an intriguing element of this story, and could be read as a metaphor for castration. The robber is permanently marked by the failed ambush, whereas the soldier and the farmer come through essentially unscathed (Tangherlini 1995).</annotation>

    <annotation>In this story of people being ambushed, a variant closely related to Jens Peter's first two stories (JPP 2.01 and 2.02), Jens Peter reveals how characters can be substituted with ease into motifemic slots to create slightly different stories (Dundes 1964). The essential features are the same: a person, carrying a large sum of money, is attacked by robbers in the hills. By his own quick action and strength, or through the intervention of a person with training in fighting (be it a huntsman or a soldier), the attack is averted and the robbers are punished.</annotation>

    <annotation>In many of Jens Peter's stories about robbers, they actually get away. If they do not manage to get away (JPP 2.01 above), they are in no condition to reveal the location of their fellow robbers. Jens Peter uses this short account as a way to wrap up his stories about robbers hiding out in the woods.

     An interesting feature of this story is the reference to a &#x201C;sv&#xE6;r krat&#x201D; or thick woods in the telling&#x2014;south of Amdal Mill, there is a farm noted on maps from the 1880s, named Tykskovg&#xE5;rd or &#x201C;Thick Woods Farm,&#x201D; even though the woods are no longer there.</annotation>

    <annotation>The tension between the peasants, who had to do villeinage at the manor farm, and the large land owners, who leased land to the peasants, informs this story. Here, the two farmers' amusing speculation about how different the rich really are leads the one farmer to put his money (or at least his horse and wagon) where his mouth is. Double entendres add significant humor to the story. The man's final evaluation of the countess as no different from anyone else is an endorsement of the liberal policies that had taken root in the peasant class--as well as among the urban elite--that people were equal, regardless of social class and wealth. It was this liberal thinking that ushered in an era of broad social and political change, from the democratic constitution of the mid nineteenth century to increasingly progressive social policies up through the early years of the twentieth century.

     The leaseholds under Baggesvogn were sold at the beginning of the nineteenth century, although many of these sales included villeinage. Villeinage was seen unanimously by farmers and smallholders alike to be an undue burden. One of the main goals of the Venstre party in the period after the promulgation of the constitution was to pass legislation that would substitute cash payments for the in-kind work of villeinage.

    Baggesvogn is five kilometers north of Sindal and was originally built in the fifteenth century. The main building was built in 1744. The dating of the legend is a bit off, as the Count Feer alluded to in the story was probably Peter Chr. de F&#xE6;dder, who owned Baggesvogn from 1799-1803. He married Kirstine Gleerup (d. 1826), who was the daughter of the previous owner, Mourids Gleerup (d. 1820). From 1803-1812, Baggesvogn was owned by Georg  Moltke-Rosenkrantz, who in turn sold the estate to Michael Aagaard, who went bankrupt in 1820. In the more than five hundred years since it was first mentioned in the historical record, Baggesvogn has had 38 owners. </annotation>

    <english_manuscript>In 1806, there was a count named Feer at Baggesvogn. He was quite hard on his peasants and he tormented and harassed them with work. One day all the peasants were gathered for villeinage and were supposed to drive the grain. There were two peasants who accompanied each other from Sindal and the countess was out walking in the woods. The one says to the other, "That's a beautiful woman." - "Yes," says the other, "that's a beautiful woman, it must be fantastic to sleep with one like that." Then the first one says that he'd gladly give his horses and wagon in exchange for the chance. The countess out in the garden hears this. As soon as they had unloaded their wagons and were going to drive off again, the man gets a message that he should go up to her. Would he stand by what he'd said? Yes, he sure would, he says. What was it he'd said? Yes, he'd give his horses and wagon to sleep with her. Then she tells the servant that he should unharness the man's horses and drive the wagon down into the courtyard. Then the man went in with her a little bit, it really wasn't too long, and then he thought he was going to get his horses and wagon back, but he didn't get them. Now he has to walk home, and so he's walking along and complaining, saying: Well, the one was pretty much like the other, he didn't notice that there was any great change, it was still the same. Then he comes to the count who was out in the field and he scolds him, why was he walking along and why didn't he have horses or a wagon. "Well," he says, "the countess took it from me, because she said that my load was smaller than the others', but I couldn't tell that there was any difference, I thought my load was just as big as theirs." "I see," says the count, "that's no good, you can follow me home to the farm, then you'll get your horses and your wagon back." Then they accompanied each other and come in to the countess. "Listen here, my dear wife," says the count, "is it true that you took the horses and wagon from this man?" "Yes, it is true." "He says that his load was smaller than the others'." "Yes, it was, too." "Yes, but you can't be that strict," says the count. "He is to have his horses and wagon back." "OK, OK, he'll get them too." He got his things and he could start driving grain again, and then that was done with. The count died a year later.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's story is a variant of legends about inexperienced use of the black book. Although Christiansen (1958) describes legends in which the devil is set to an innocuous task (for example making ropes of sand) while the person waits for assistance from a person more skilled in magic, there is no such salvation for the countess in this story.

     One can read the countess's grisly death at the hands of the devil as a form of narrative retribution. In the previous legend, Jens Peter told of the poor treatment that the peasants received from the count, as well as the lax morals of the countess herself. In this story, the countess arrogantly attempts to undue the curse on the farm herself, rather than rely on the services of the Bragholdt hag for example, and her arrogance is punished decisively. 

      The punishment meted out by the devil is reminiscent of punishments suffered by those who have a pact with the devil (DS VI 144 and 150), and the countess's status as a wealthy landowner would make her equally suspect of this type of unholy alliance.

     The countess transgresses numerous social norms during her s&#xE9;ance. Bringing a draught animal into the house is unusual at best, and at worst proposes an inversion of the normal household organization. Enlisting the help of women of lower social status enacts two transgressions at once: First, it crosses the social boundaries that divide the classes and thus is reminiscent of her sexual dalliance with the farmer (JPP 2.05). Second, it exposes her hired hands to extraordinary danger, a reification of the mistreatment of workers for which she and her husband are known.

     The black book, in Denmark referred to as Cyprianus, was often in the possession of both wise ministers and cunning folk. The name of the book is linked to Cyprian who was martyred in 290 (R&#xF8;rbye 1976, 260). Here, the Bragholdt hag is a local cunning woman, even though Jens Peter describes her as a witch. Even though a Cyprianus would have been a prized possession, the countess would likely have had enough power to convince the Bragholdt hag to lend her the book.

     Bragholt lies three kilometers slightly to the north and east of Baggesvogn. Later maps indicate two farms at Bragholt, "Stor Bragholt" and "Lille Bragholt," probably a result of a division of the properties of the original Bragholt. It is unlikely that Bragholt was a manor farm; it was probably a large farm, perhaps a propriet&#xE6;rg&#xE5;rd. Again, the dating of the story seems unlikely, as the count at Baggesvogn in 1808 was Georg Moltke-Rosenkrantz, and not de F&#xE6;dder. Of course, de F&#xE6;dder's wife Kirstine did not die until 1826; she married Moltke-Rosenkrantz after her husband Chr. Peter de F&#xE6;dder died, making Moltke-Rosenkrantz the count at Baggesvogn.</annotation>

The Bragholdt hag wasn't there, because if she'd been there, it would have gone fine. One of the women had a son who worked at the farm as an ox handler.

    <annotation>"Showing again" is a common skill of the cunning folk (AMJ 2.07; KMP 1.56). In this case, the Bragholdt hag gets her ability to show again from a small demon, a confirmation of her link to Satan. This link is implicit in her owning Cyprianus in the previous story (JPP 2.06). The Bragholdt hag's morality is drawn further into question when she is described as a drunk. One of the ongoing concerns in debates over the different classes of poor--the deserving and undeserving--was the high incidence of alcoholism among the poor, and the effects of alcoholism on their ability to provide for themselves.

     Stories of questionable practices in the cunning woman's barn are fairly widely attested--enough for Tang Kristensen to include a subsection in his published collection Danske sagn entitled "I den kloge kones lade om natten" [In the cunning woman's barn at night] (DS VI, 323 and 326). In these stories, the cunning woman calls the devil to her to extract information (DS VI 898). The story, however, is not solely a criticism of the Bragholdt hag. The local economies of rural Denmark were moving quickly towards complete monetization by the last decades of the nineteenth century, and payment for services rather than barter arrangements had become the norm. In the story, Iver attempts to sidestep paying the Bragholdt hag for rendering a valuable service--canvas was important both as an item that could be sold and as a source of material for work clothes--only to discover that the implicit contractual arrangement held sway. She of course uses her supernatural power, rather than the power of the magistrate, to collect on her debt. But she also makes good on her side of the bargain, and the new economic order is firmly established: monetary payment for services rendered. In some variants, the person manages to get away without paying (DS VI 900), while others include a greater emphasis on the contractual arrangement than in this variant (DS VI 899).

     That the canvas is hidden in the minister's meadow is a tantalizing variation on the story. In his repertoire, Jens Peter tells several stories of ministers who tread the fine line between good and evil. The implication in this story is that either (a) the minister--or perhaps his wife--had something to do with the theft or (b) someone is trying to frame the minister for the crime.     

     Unlike Peder Johansen, who's father's foster father was a cunning man, and Ane Margrete Jensdatter (AMJ 2.20), whose stories generally endorse the powers of cunning folk, Jens Peter is critical of cunning folk. Here, he links the Bragholdt hag directly to the devil, and implies that she is in fact a witch. Her actions align her with another cunning person in his repertoire, St&#xF8;v-Karen, who is interested primarily in personal gain (JPP 1.04). Jens Peter's critique of the cunning folk diverges from the critique proffered by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter, who was much more of a rationalist and viewed the widespread belief in the ability of  witches and cunning folk to be foolish.

     The distance from Knudsholm to Bragholdt is approximately fifteen kilometers.

    <english_manuscript>There was a man who lived on Knudsholm in Ugilt parish, they called him Iver Holmen or "Long Iver." He had a large piece of canvas that disappeared one fall. Then he went down to this here Bragholdt hag and she was supposed to show the canvas again, who had taken it. When he gets down to her, she's so drunk. She tells him to come the next morning, then she'd tell him where the canvas was. He felt that it was quite a ways from Bragholdt to Knudsholm, and the barn was in bad shape, he could probably get in through one of the walls and hide himself in some hay in there and so he went in and hid himself in some hay. It wasn't too long before the hag came into the barn too and she had a little one with her, she was holding it by the hair in one of her hands and she had a wet dishrag in the other and slapped him with that. He was supposed to tell her where the canvas was. Then the Devil says: "He hears, he hears, he hears!" But the hag was so drunk she didn't notice he said that. Well, she continued slapping him, he was to tell her where the canvas was. He had to at last and he said that it lay in the side of a hollow down on the minister's meadow, that's where it was hidden. The minister in Ugilt has a meadow on the north side of Holmen's field. Then the hag and the Devil left and the man went home, he didn't want the hag to get any money for this. But the following morning a message came for him, he had to go out there and talk to her. She wanted her payment and then he could leave. Then he went and got his canvas, it was right where they'd said it would be.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The haunting in this legend has two components: holes in the wall that cannot be repaired (DS V 248 and DS V 255), and the wandering pig (DS V 42). Other animals, such as calves (DS V 39 and 49), oxen (DS V 45) and horses (DS V 37) are widely attested as similar haunts. In some variants, the connection between the animal haunt and the devil is made explicit (DS V 47).

     Animal haunts are often inexplicable, yet they disrupt, to one degree or another, the farm, particularly the barn. The barn is doubly at risk in Jens Peter's story, since the two holes cannot be repaired. The sow's subsequent disappearance in the stone wall may be linked to conjuring, as stone walls, mill dams, and other boundary markers are frequently mentioned as places where spirits have been conjured (DS V 359 and DS V 713). In this case, the conjuring must have been unsuccessful, since the haunt continues to disrupt the farm.

     Jens Peter's stories tended to be quite localized to the area near where he lived. Amdal is one kilometer west of Ilbjerge huse. Hvidstedg&#xE5;rd is on the south side and one and a half kilometers down the road from Amdal to T&#xE5;rs, four kilometers to the southwest.</annotation>

    <annotation>In his stories, Jens Kristensen acribes supernatural powers to Pastor Trap, including the ability to be two places at once and to tell the future. These capabilities certainly qualify the minister as a wise minister and align him with other wise ministers that figure prominently in Jens Peter's repertoire (JPP 1.07-09). Pastor Trap's apparent wealth and power is unusual for a local minister; Jens Peter connects this to Trap's alleged membership in the Freemasons. There are numerous stories about the Freemasons, describing them as having access to untold wealth (DS VI 48), but also indicating that they have a pact with the devil (DS VI 66).

     The first Freemason organization in Denmark started in Copenhagen in 1743. This was modeled after the British Freemasonry that emerged in London in 1717. Danish Freemasonry was organized according to both German and British precedent through the first part of the nineteenth century. King Frederik VII was instrumental in changing the organization of the Danish lodge to the Swedish system of Freemasonry in 1858. Interestingly, Peder Johansen's boss at the mill in Fuldbro was a member of the masons (see biographical essay on Peder Johansen); despite this (or perhaps because of this), Peder did not tell any stories of the alleged supernatural abilities of masons.

     Tang Kristensen collected other variants of this story that also included Pastor Trap's ability to foresee the date of his death (DS VI 68). Erik Jessen Trap was the owner of Hvidstedg&#xE5;rd from 1782-1804, and the parish minister in T&#xE5;rs. His crypt is under the altar in the church in T&#xE5;rs.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's story of a local, murderous robber resonates with his other stories of robbers who hide in more desolate forests and hills (JPP 2.01-04). The hiding place--a nearby mound--calls to mind stories about mound dwellers, yet Daniel shares none of their characteristics, apart from the fact that he is a threat to the community. Other local variants of the story provide additional detail about Daniel's exploits, the location of his hide-out, and his final punishment (DS IV 1591, 1593). In one variant, he is referred to as St&#xE6;rke-Ole (DS IV 1594).

    Daniel's threat to the community is immediate and overwhelming. Not only does he threaten the economy of the community but also the physical well-being of everyone in it, including the children. 

    Numerous stories tell of the supernatural benefits of eating the hearts of children: extraordinary strength or the ability to make oneself invisible (DS IV 1588). The murder and ingestion of the most vulnerable members of the community for personal gain underscore the extraordinary threat represented by Daniel.

    Punishment for murder was death, and execution by beheading was in force up until 1933. Executions were public events up through much of the nineteenth century although, by the 1890s, executions were held at prisons, with only prison officials present (Steensberg 1964, vol. 2, 345-347).</annotation>

    <annotation>The basilisk is a legendary creature, much like the lindorm. The basilisk develops from the egg of an old rooster (!) (DS II E 211) or, more often, inside old casks of beer or mead (DS II E 213). The basilisk is destructive, and kills everything with which it comes into contact (DS II E 214). 

      In this story, the threat of the basilisk appears within the boundaries of the farm, inside an otherwise mundane, yet important, piece of equipment. The threat, like that of the robbers and witches whom preoccupy Jens Peter in his other stories, is immediate and local. The basilisk threatens not only the well being of people who see it, but also compromises the economic well being of the inn, since the sale of beer or mead is an important source of income for innkeepers.

     Jens Peter maintains his keen interest in the immediate area surrounding Ugilt and its early history. In another variant of the story (JPP 4.36), he segues from a story about Skyt-Kr&#xE6;n, who also appears in other stories of his (JPP 1.05). Spangerhede also appears in several of his stories (JPP 2.03 and 2.09). In this story, the wide open fields of the manor farm offer a convenient dumping ground for the terrifying creature.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter continues with his exploration of the local area, and the terrifying landscape that surrounds Ugilt. The implication in this story is that the inn was the site of several grisly murders. The actual crime remains unsolved, and the skeletons are buried in properly consecrated ground. While one would expect Jens Peter to tell stories about hauntings occurring at the inn, he does not. He does however connect the appearance of the basilisk with the skeletons, proposing that all sorts of bad things--such as murder and witchcraft--plagued the area in the past.

     Numerous stories tell of wandering merchants who have been murdered, and their remains found many years later (DS IV 1371). In these stories, murders often take place at inns (DS IV 1384 and JPP 2.14), or events leading up to a murder stem from an encounter at the inn (JPP 2.01 and 2.02). 

     In a later telling of this story (JPP 4.36), Jens Peter reverses the order of the stories, recounting the grisly find at the location of the old inn before telling about the basilisk (JPP 2.11).</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's storytelling provides a map for reading features of the local landscape, instilling significance in features that others might not notice. In this manner, Jens Peter emerges as a knowledgeable guide to local topography, and provides a reading of the landscape that infuses it with tragedy and danger. The loss of the local minister in a horrible accident would have been a memorable event. 

     It is about five kilometers from Vrejlev to Hvidstedg&#xE5;rd, and one can easily imagine a shortcut over the meadow between the road from Vrejlev to T&#xE5;rs, across Boller k&#xE6;r (marsh), and on through the meadow at Hvidstedg&#xE5;rd.

     In the published version of the story, Tang Kristensen reversed the order of several sentences for no apparent reason. He also mistranscribed the name of the farm as Hvilstedg&#xE5;rd. The meadow near Hvidstedg&#xE5;rd is fed by the Uggerby river.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story combines Jens Peter's fascination with robbers and inns. Unlike his other stories about horse dealers traveling with large sums of money, this horse dealer would have been better off on the road than the seeming safety of the inn (JPP 2.01 and 2.02). Melting lead into the ears of a sleeping guest is widely attested as a presumably undetectable method for murder (DS IV 1407). Other methods include driving a nail through the ear of a sleeping person (DS IV 1405 and 1406). Murder will out, and many legends attest to the surprising manner in which the ill deed is uncovered.</annotation>

    <annotation>The manor lord's haunt is a classic example of a guilty haunt and is widely attested (DS IV 691; Pentika&#xEF;nen 1969). The manor lord is threatening not only in life, but in death as well. 

     Jens Peter turns to the wise minister for help, narratively proposing this as an effective strategy against the haunting of the manor lord (Tangherlini 1998). The conjuring does not proceed smoothly, and the farmhand's interruption nearly dooms the minister, a motif that is wll known from other stories of conjuring (DS V 728 and 733; PJ 2.05; KMP 1.07). In some stories, the minister actually does lose power over the ghost because of the farmhand's interruption, and these stories often detail the catastrophic results of that interruption (DS IV 744).

     Kristian IV's wife, Kristine Munk, was exiled to the manor farm at Boller, and lived there from 1630-1658. Later, the manor farm became part of the larger holdings of the Count of Frijesenborg (PJ 3.18).</annotation>

    <annotation>The revenant in this story plays a role familiar from stories about the minister racing Satan or where Satan is forced to act as the fourth wheel of a wagon (DS V 713 and DS VI 315). Racing the revenant is also widely attested (DS V 715), and the similarity between these stories confirms the Lutheran conflation of revenants with Satan (Tangherlini 1998).

     Master Niels, a wise minister, figures prominently in one of Jens Peter's other stories (JPP 1.08). He proves himself once again to be adept at protecting the community against the threat of the revenant (in the earlier story, he also fought with a guilty haunt). It is unclear why the man at H&#xE6;strup mill haunts, although it seems likely he is a guilty haunt, given that the two race to "the scene of the crime." Peder Johansen also tells several stories that indicate that mill workers were not necessarily the most honest people (PJ 1.02).  

     While it is possible that this story and JPP 1.08 are the same story, &#xC5;strup mill is approximately five and half kilometers north and west of H&#xE6;strup mill. Given Jens Peter's precision concerning topography and place names, it seems unlikely that he would confuse the two places. It is more likely that Jens Peter considered mills to be sites of corruption and dishonesty, which led in turn to haunting (and stories about hauntings).</annotation>

    <annotation>The motif of the brave person who sits inside a circle drawn on the church floor and refuses the devil's temptations is well known throughout Scandinavia (DS V 855). The minister dares not spend the night in the church, and the volunteer agrees to sit vigil, as it were, in exchange for a considerable economic reward, in this case a cow. It is worth noting that the Lutheran church prohibited the practice of sitting vigil after the Reformation.

     The brave person is often a poor cobbler (DS V 860). The devil notes the underlying fiscal motivation driving the cobbler's bravery. The cobbler counters that he is simply engaged in normal economic activity--the making of a pair of shoes.

     Sitting under the church bell, rather than inside a circle, is also attested as efficacious against the threat of the revenant or the devil (DS V 864). Irrespective of where the brave person sits, the threat is directed at the sanctity of the church itself and by extension the very center of the community. 

     Jens Peter's story resolves positively both for the community, which gets the church back, and for the cobbler, whose economic fortune increases greatly.</annotation>

    <annotation>In this widely reported story, the dead suitor returns to claim his bride. In many variants, the girl does not realize that the man is dead until they arrive at the cemetery (DS II G 221). In Jens Peter's variant, the girl is terrified by the black dog digging in the cemetery, and she soon realizes that she is dealing with a horrifying revenant. It is somewhat surprising that she does not realize that she is dealing with a revenant already at the beginning of the story when her boyfriend rides up, since she should know that he is dead.

     Jens Peter continues his story beyond the standard resolution in which the girl recognizes that her fianc&#xE9; is dead and runs for safety (DS II G 219). In his variant, the revenant appears at the door of the church house and attempts to enlist another dead person in capturing the girl. The girl's shredded apron on the grave stone is reminiscent of the shredded apron strings that reveal the true identity of a werewolf (BJK 2.15).

     The rhyme that the boy recites is a common feature of the story, although the order of the first and second line is sometimes switched. The greatest variation is in the third line:  "r&#xE6;ddes du ikke lille Pige" [aren't you getting scared, little girl] (DS II G 221); "bliver du ikke bange min lille Pige" [aren't you getting frightened my little girl] (DS II G 220); "frygter du ej, mit hj&#xE6;rte" [do you not fear, my heart] (DS II G 220); "er du ikke bange lille Lisbet" [aren't you frightened, little Lisbet] (DSnr II G 136); "er du bange mit Hj&#xE6;rte" [are you frightened, my heart] (DSnr II G 139); "bliver du ikke bange, lille Pige" [are you getting frightened, little girl] (DS II G 140); "er du ikke bange, lille Pige" [aren't you frightened, little giril] (DSnr II G 141); "&#xC6; do et r&#xE6;j, Karen?" [Ain't you scared, Karen?] (DSnr II G 142); "&#xE6; do et r&#xE6;d, lille Maren" [ain't you scared, little Maren] (DS II G 222 and DSnr II G 143); "og kj&#xE6;resten min s&#xF8;rger ikke" [and my sweetheart does not sorrow] (DSnr II G 145). Grundtvig in Gamle danske Minder  III (241-2) asked his readers to send him examples of the story in which the verse appeared, noting that, as of 1861, there were no Danish recordings of the legend.

     Tang Kristensen added a long note to the end of the published version of this story, writing: "Ved enligt liggende Kirker laa der tit et Kirkehus, hvor man s&#xF8;gte til med smaa B&#xF8;rn, der skulde d&#xF8;bes o. lign. Af og til kunde der sidde et Fattiglem til Leje der. Ved Vindum Kirke har der f. Ex. i &#xE6;ldre Tid v&#xE6;ret saadant et Kirkehus, der for l&#xE6;ngst er revet ned og ikke erstattet med noget andet. Fort&#xE6;lleren sagde, at Kisten blev vendt, men var det ikke Liget, der blev vendt i Kisten, saa han kom til at ligge paa Maven?" [Near solitary churches there was often a church house where one brought small children that were to be baptized and the like. Every now and then a poor person could be there as a renter. At Vindum church, for example, in olden times there was a church house like that which has long since been torn down and nothing has been built in its place. The storyteller said that the coffin was turned, but isn't it more likely that it was the corpse in the coffin that was turned so it wound up lying on its stomach?] There is no reason to think that Jens Peter did not mean that the coffin should be turned, rather than the body. The general belief was that bodies should be carried out of the house feet first, otherwise they could return to the house to haunt. Apparently, the body has been left in the house with the head facing the door, making it possible for him to assist the boy's revenant in capturing the girl. Turning the coffin around would deny him that ability.</annotation>

One evening the girl is out walking and then the boy comes riding up on a black horse and the saddle was so very shiny. Then the boy says, Dead man rides erect The moon shines brightly Do not be afraid, little Maren! They accompany each other to the cemetery, he was riding there. Then she was to hold his horse for a little while. She felt that he was gone for quite a while and she wanted to go and look through the cemetery gate. Then she sees a huge black dog that was clawing at the ground as hard as he could; it was the grave where the boy had been buried. The girl had put her apron over the saddle because she thought it was so pretty. When she saw the dog tossing dirt into the air she got so scared that she ran away down to the church house. There was a man who lived in that house and a corpse had been brought there that was supposed to have been buried the day before but they had come too late with it and when she comes inside to this man, she tells him what was going on. Then the man says, "Let's turn this coffin around." They turned the coffin around, so that the head was on the other side. Soon after there's a knock on the door, and it names the name of the man who is lying in the coffin, he was to open the door. But then the corpse answered that he was forbidden to do so, he'd been turned and so he couldn't open the door. Now the girl stayed in the church house that night, but the next morning when the man went up to the church to look for her apron he found it lying there torn to pieces. The boy wanted the girl along with him in the cemetery and have her buried along with him. She never saw him again.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's short description of his encounter with Uen's (Odin's) hunter acts as a bridge between stories of ghosts and his final story of another supernatural being, the mermaid. 

     There are numerous legends of Odin's hunter, a huntsman who travels the country. In some stories, it is suggested that Odin's hunter hunts supernatural beings, particularly elves (DS II C 78). He is often accompanied by several dogs. 

     The name shows great variation across stories. In many stories, he is referred to as Wojens hunter. One variant suggests that he comes from the town of Wojens in Salling (DS II C 25). Other stories suggest that the hunter is King Valdemar (DS II C 36). 

     Many stories propose that the hunter has made an agreement with the Lord to be allowed to hunt for all eternity (DS II C 24). Feilberg provides an exhaustive list of attestations of Odins j&#xE6;ger in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and German collections (Feilberg 2, 730-3). Lindow notes that the earliest attestation of this story comes from a Cistercian monk, Heliand de Froidmont, in a text preserved by Vincenz de Beauvais (Lindow 1978, 116). In Nordic mythology, Odin is not known for either hunting prowess or for keeping dogs. Wolves, yes, dogs, no.</annotation>

    <annotation>The mermaid in Jens Peter's story is hardly the love struck mermaid from Hans Christian Andersen's short story that most people think of when they think of Danish mermaids. Instead, she is a threatening creature, whose antics first bother the farmhand, and later lead to the destruction of his livelihood.

      Burning the mermaid is not the best strategy for dealing with her and, like most supernatural beings, her reaction is extreme. The seeming nonsense she utters parallels other phrases uttered by supernatural beings, the best known of these being the announcement of the death of Pan (see Boberg 1934).

     Tang Kristensen did not publish this version, choosing a later variant instead (JPP 4.02). The note at the end of the manuscript edition is not a reference to H.C. Andersen's mermaid, but rather a reference to another variant of this story told by Gerhard Peter Andersen from L&#xF8;rslev and appended to Jens Peter's later variant.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's story of tricking the gypsy offers another view of the natm&#xE6;nd (refuse workers; nightmen) and wanderers that were resoundingly criticized in Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter's stories. In Kirsten Marie's story of a marriage between a Dane and a gypsy, the outcome is tragic (KMP 1.33). In this story, the marriage is more of an aside, and hardly a cause for approbation, worry or sorrow.

     Although this story is reminiscent of Kirsten Marie's story of tricking a stodderkonge [beggar bailiff] (KMP 1.03), there are several important differences.  In that story, the stodderkonge is made to look foolish; here, the poorer farmhand simply takes advantage of an opportunity to get a little money from a person both drunk and known to be generous. The reversal of status--essentially begging from a natmand--is amusing, and does not seem to be worrisome to either Elias or Jens T&#xE5;rs. 

     The apparent wealth of the gypsy aligns with the story of the gypsy birth banquet from Kirsten Marie's repertoire (KMP 2.07). In her story, the gypsies' wealth is a cause for suspicion and can be interpreted in the context of widely held conservative views of poverty assistance laws. Jens Peter seems to be more accepting, if not downright impressed, by Elias's wealth, and there is little implication that Elias is engaged in anything illicit. 

     Elias is criticized for being a snob,  something that is hard to imagine given the status of gypsies and natm&#xE6;nd in rural Danish society. His desire for respect violates the unwritten rules of social decorum known as Janteloven [the Law of Jante] articulated by Aksel Sandemose in his popular novel, En flygtning krydser sit spor (1933). Elias's generosity makes up for his apparent desire to move up socially.  Unexpectedly, his wealth stems from his natmand work, as Jens Peter mentions in the story that Elias was on his way home to slaughter a horse. 

     Again, Jens Peter loads his narrative with local place names, and situates events and people in this narratively rich landscape. The mention of Natmandsbank [Nightman's Hill] reveals the degree to which the separation of this class of people permeated the local landscape. Interestingly, Jens Hansen moves out to this area once he marries into ELias's family. This would be akin to marrying down, since Jens Peter tells us that Jens Hansen was a farmer's son. But Elias's wealth seems to mitigate this problem.</annotation>

Cotter Jens Taars from Ugilt met Elias one time up by Hvidevold and since Elias was a bit drunk, Jens Taars asked him, "I say my good man, can you spare a few shillings for a poor man?" Elias was riding on a nag that he had gotten in Hj&#xF8;rring and that he was supposed to bring home and slaughter. "Yes, I certainly can, I was once poor myself." So he got a couple of shillings. Jens Taars ran up ahead then and came up to him again down at Fuglsig vase (crossing) and says the same thing. You see Elias was pretty drunk and didn't recognize him.

    <annotation>There is only minimal difference between this telling and his earlier telling of this story, despite the five years separating the performances (JPP 2.20). 

     The published version is an amalgamation of Jens Peter's two versions of this story (see 2.20). While the published version more closely follows this version, the coda in the published version mentioning that his father had seen the ruins comes from the earlier telling.  At the end of the published version, Tang Kristensen added a secondary story told by Gerhard Peter Andersen (b. 1837-1918), a teacher in L&#xF8;rslev. Andersen's story replaced an annotation at the end of the manuscript recording noting that Jens Peter's story should be compared the story by Andersen. Andersen's story is as follows:

     "Another one tells how it was the manor lord from Elling farm that started the factory which lay south of Strandby near the ocean. He had two farmhands to run it, and they switched off getting lunch from the farm. As soon as one of the farmhands had left, this mermaid came ashore and went to the hollow where the kettle was to warm herself." 

     Tang Kristensen visited G.P. Andersen's house when he visited Jens Peter in 1893 (MO III 486, 500). He had first met Andersen in 1892 (MO III 454), and had also corresponded briefly with him (MO III 458). Tang Kristensen did not collect any stories from Andersen at that time, using him more as a local contact. For example, Andersen introduced Tang Kristensen to the remarkable fairy tale teller Anders Rasmussen (see Holbek 1987; recordings Field Diary 5892a-5931a). Andersen had contributed to Grundtvig's Danske Sagn, and several of his stories, including this one, are printed in that collection (Grundtvig and Ellekilde 1944-1948, vol. 1, 340). Andersen had collected fairy tales and legends in his youth, publishing some in a small book that he gave Tang Kristensen (MO III 455), and sending others to Adjunkt Wulf in &#xC5;lborg, who published some of these stories in Samlinger for jysk Historie og Topografi (MO III 455). </annotation>

    <annotation>Stories of the mound dwellers' smithing is closely related to stories of their baking (Boberg 1938; Tangherlini 1998). Jens Peter implicitly acknowledges this connection, as his next story is a variant of ML5080, "Food from the Fairies" (JPP 4.04). 

     The mound dwellers' baking is a model for low-level out group barter transaction (Tangherlini 1998). The expectation of both parties is reasonable payment for services. In this story, the passing farmer enters into a contractual relationship with the mound dwellers, a relationship that he recognizes himself. The farmer, however, does not keep up his part of the bargain. One would expect that such a non-reciprocal transaction--effectively theft--would result in some form of retribution (or at least an attempt at retribution as in the case of the stolen drinking horn ML6045, "Drinking Cup Stolen from the Fairies"; JPP 4.04). Such is not the case here, and the man and his successors on the farm all get use of a remarkably well-forged tool, clearly of significant benefit to the farm's economy. The "lang-j&#xE6;rn" [lit. long-iron] is known in English as a "jointer knife" and is a vertical blade that runs in front of the plowshare, and is used to help cut field stubble.

     While it may be tempting to read the long iron as a gift from the mound dwellers (Boberg 1938; Mauss 1967), one would then have to disregard the statement, "they didn't get any payment for it," a recognition that the encounter included an implicit, reciprocal, monetized transaction.

     Tang Kristensen identified the supernatural beings in this story as dwarves, probably based on the Nordic mythological record that ascribes great prowess in smithing to dwarves. Jens Peter, however, makes no mention of dwarves, and it is more likely that the beings are the tradition dominant mound dwellers. This assignation would also link it to the next story about the mound dwellers' baking (JPP 4.04).

     As typical for his stories, Jens Peter includes remarkable local detail about where the events transpired. L&#xF8;rslev is just north of Ilbjerge huse, and Dals mill is just to the east. The other place names are the names of farms and houses in the immediate area.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter tells a variant of a the widely attested story of the mound dwellers' baking. The repair of the broken peel board is an example of a typical, low level, barter (non monetized) transaction with an out group trading partner. These stories allow narrators to explore--and endorse or reject--the advisability of such out group trade, as part of the growing rejection of the "limited good" model of economic organization (Tangherlini 1998; Foster 1965). 

     Out group trade can be a fraught proposition for a number of reasons. First, members of two different groups do not necessarily share the same values, and it can be difficult to calculate "fairness" in items traded, particularly in the realm of barter. Second, members from different groups do not necessarily have an expectation of repeated interaction. The rules governing one-off trade can be quite different from the rules governing continued trade. Stories of the mound dwellers baking explore many of these problems, and different narrators, through their choice of resolution, endorse widely divergent strategies for out group trade (Tangherlini 1998). In Jens Peter's version, the young hired boy refuses to take part in the transaction, and suffers dire consequences. The older farmer accepts the barter payment and thrives. 

     Tang Kristensen, as a note to the published version, wrote, "J.P.P. viste mig H&#xF8;jen, der virkelig nu er n&#xE6;sten ukjendelig som H&#xF8;j og kun viser sig som en lille Forh&#xF8;jning i Jordsmonnet" [J.P.P. showed me the mound which is now practically unrecognizable as a mound and appears as just a little rise in the ground].</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories of people hanging themselves as a form of amusement are not uncommon (DS VI 430). The old sailor appears at first to be the voice of reason, refusing to join in with the rest of his shipmates. His solitary change of mind, however, puts him in a position of significant danger. Suicides absent themselves from community through the act of suicide itself and its aftermath. The self-centered pursuit of anything--wealth, fame or, in this case death--are generally decried narratively since all of these individual pursuits undermine community. The devil, of course, encourages the destruction of community. The Lutheran church considered suicide to be a sin, although Luther wrote: "I don't have the opinion that suicides are certainly to be damned. My reason is that they do not wish to kill themselves but are overcome by the power of the devil" (Luther 1967, vol. 54, 29). 

     In this story, the devil appears in the shape of a large, mysterious cat, one of his more common animal forms (Woods 1958). Interestingly, there is no appeal to religious symbolism in this story, which makes it unusual. In other stories of suicide, death is often averted by the use of such symbolism (JPP 4.06).

     Suicide does not seem to be the goal of the sailors' bizarre undertaking. Rather, they seem interested in tempting death or, in this case, the devil. There is a small possibility that the men are engaged in a form of auto-erotic asphyxia as a way to pass the time, a suggestion that is hinted at in other stories (DS VI 431).

      There are no statistics about suicide in the Danish navy from this period.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man down in Jerup, he'd been in the navy for fifteen years in the old war. They'd had quiet weather for four days and couldn't sail, and so the three hundred men who were on board decided to see what it was like to be hung. So one after the other, and then, the one who was up was supposed to put his finger in the air when he didn't want to hang any longer. Then there was an old sailor, sixty years old, he didn't want to try this. They'd all tried it by that time. So they all went up on deck and they're missing him, he wasn't with them and so they wanted to go back down to look for him. They get down below decks but they can't get into the room where they'd tried this. The door was locked so they couldn't open it. Then at that moment the ship's captain comes along and says, "Break down the door!" Then they smashed the door to pieces and when they get in there, there was a black cat sitting on the head of the old guy and he was hanging up in the noose and he was dead. The doctor managed to bring him back to life. They didn't have any cats on board but it got up and went up on deck and out into the sea, after that the old man laughed. The old man told them afterward that when they had gone up he decided to try it, but as soon as he had his chin in the noose, it was just as if they'd put a barrel of grain that's how heavy it got and then he didn't remember a thing. If they hadn't come out and smashed the door down, then he'd never have survived. The old man from Jerup had seen the whole thing and said that it was true. My father worked at the farm with him. He'd get so mad when people didn't believe his stories. He didn't want to try it because he thought it was silly.</english_manuscript>

    <english_publication>There was a man down in Jerup, he&#x2019;d been in the navy for fifteen years in the old war, and he told about a strange thing that had happened on the ship. They&#x2019;d had quiet weather for four days and couldn&#x2019;t sail, and so the three hundred men who were on board decided that, to amuse themselves and to pass the time, they should try what it was like to hang themselves. They were hung up, one after the other, and then the one who was up was supposed to put his finger in the air when he didn&#x2019;t want to hang any longer. Then there was an old sailor, he was sixty years old, and he didn&#x2019;t want to try this because he thought it was silly. They&#x2019;d all tried it, but he wouldn&#x2019;t. Then the crew goes up on deck and they&#x2019;re missing the old guy. So they wanted to go back down to get him and they get down below decks but they can&#x2019;t get into the room where they&#x2019;d tried the hanging because the door was locked and they couldn&#x2019;t open it. Then the ship&#x2019;s captain comes along and says, &#x201C;Smash open the door!&#x201D; Then they smashed the door to pieces and when they get in there, the old guy is hanging up in the noose and there&#x2019;s a black cat sitting on his head. Then it got up and ran up on deck and jumped out into the sea. They didn&#x2019;t have any cats on board so they were totally puzzled by that sight. Then they cut the old guy down and he seemed to be dead but the doctor managed to bring him back to life. When he came to, he told them that, when the others had gone up, he decided to try it, but as soon as he&#x2019;d gotten his chin in the noose, it was as if a barrel of grain had been put on his head, and then he didn&#x2019;t remember a thing. If they hadn&#x2019;t come in and smashed the door down, then he&#x2019;d never have survived. The man from Jerup saw the whole thing and swore that this was true. My father worked at the farm with him and he told him about it. He could get so mad when people didn&#x2019;t believe his stories.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Stories in which suicide figures prominently are widely attested, and the devil often plays a significant role in these stories (DS VI 434; PJ 2.05). The story conflates aspects of folk belief with Lutheran teaching. The girl, much like the sailor in the previous story (JPP 4.05), absents herself from the company of others and moves into darkness. This move can be read symbolically as an act parallel to the contemplated suicide that will wrest her from the community. Satan's role as the king of darkness contrasts sharply with God's kingdom of light, a kingdom that the girl inadvertently summons when she says the Lord's prayer. Jens Peter's mention of a person named Gotfred is interesting, since it appears to be a reference to another story, yet this is the only story in which a Gotfred appears.</annotation>

    <annotation>Legends of midwifery often support the idea that midwives had supernatural powers. The man gets his comeuppance when he is forced to suffer his wife's labor pains. This story would have no doubt been quite attractive to women. 

     Midwives were more than specialized folk healers, although many midwives did in fact also practice as folk healers. They were part of a newly emerging class of civil servants and integral members of the emerging health care system (Norrie 1935; Petersen and Blomqvist 1996). The first midwife commission was established in Denmark in 1714. By 1791, all the districts in the country had a civil doctor (embedsl&#xE6;ge) who could serve in the capacity of midwife, although that position was usually filled by a local, female midwife. In 1787, a national midwifery college opened in Copenhagen and, by 1810, a regulation was in place that required that all districts have a certified midwife. By 1851, every pastorate also had to establish a public health commission (sundhedskommission). All of these developments were part of an ever increasing process to improve people's health and reduce infant mortality.

     Jens Peter's marriage was very short and produced no children. His wife may have died soon after they were married and, if that was the case, it is quite possible that she died in childbirth (much like Tang Kristensen's first wife); this might help explain why Jens Peter remembers this story. Jens Peter did have a child out of wedlock, and so he was no stranger to childbirth and the dangers that came with it.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's story emphasizes the threat that witchcraft poses to the local farming economy: cows milked to death, other magic performed on cows (likely stampeding), and mills turning without wind. It is worth noting that the chamberlain has the girl milk a cotter's cow to death, and not one of his own. 

     The girl is young enough not to be a full blown witch, and re-baptizing her proves efficacious against her budding relationship with Satan. Other stories describe young girls being initiated into witchcraft by older mentors (DS VII 527). These initiations always remove the young girls from the broader community. Re-baptism, conversely, allowed the neophyte witch to be accepted back into the community. In this story, the girl returns to her community as innocent as when she was born--and accordingly is transformed back into an infant. Jens Peter makes no mention of whether the girl later regained her faculties.

     Jens Peter's coda provides an interesting insight into naming conventions in rural Denmark. Nicknames often referred to local places or houses. At the end of the century, it became more common for people to seek permission to change family names from patronymics to more individualized names, such as place names. In 1828, Frederik VI promulgated a baptismal order that required standardized and persistent family names (in favor of the earlier use of patronymics). By 1903, people who wanted to use place names as family names had to prove a clear relationship to that area.

     B&#xF8;rglum monastery was originally a royal landholding. Knud the Holy was driven from B&#xF8;rglum when the Vendels rose up in 1086. In 1128, the holdings were given to the Cistercians, and B&#xF8;rglum monastery became the See for the surrounding area. After the Reformation in 1536, B&#xF8;rglum was reclaimed by the Crown and offered to various aristocrats as a len (fief). It was still used as the Bishopric until 1554, when Laurits Nilsson moved the Bishopric to &#xC5;lborg. In 1623, B&#xF8;rglum became part of Sor&#xF8; Academy, a school for young aristocrats. After the dissolution of the academy in 1669, it became an independent holding. The current Sor&#xF8; Academy is on Sj&#xE6;lland, at another former Cistercian monastery. The reference to Chamberlain Hiller&#xF8;d must be to Niels Friderichsen Hillerup (d. 1819), who acquired B&#xF8;rglum in 1802 and also owned Vrejlev monastery.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Chamberlain Hiller&#xF8;d at B&#xF8;rglum monastery. The other girls complained about a girl who worked there who was fifteen or sixteen years old. She seemed cunning to them, because she could make their gloves and clogs dance and they wouldn't stay there unless she was sent away. One day they were all going to leave. Then the chamberlain said to the coachman that he should harness up the wagon, they were going to go out driving, and he takes the girl along with him in the carriage and they drive out to B&#xF8;rglum parsonage and they get the minister to come along too. Then they drive to the town Vitrup which belongs to the manor, and there's a big red cotter's cow standing there. Then the chamberlain says that she should get out of the wagon and milk the cow until it died, could she do that? Sure, she could do that easily. She jumps down and milks so long until she milks pure blood and then the cow died immediately. Then they drive to &#xC5;senterp. There she also does small magic with cows and calves and the dean and the chamberlain sit and watch. Finally they come to a windmill, that stood west of the farm. Then the minister and chamberlain asked her if she could get the mill to turn, it was still weather. Sure, she could do that, she says and then she got the mill started and she could probably stop it again too. Then the minister says to her, "Now that's enough!" and they drove home to the monastery, and they had to go into the church now and there the minister re-baptized her. After that she was like an infant, she completely lost her senses, and she couldn't do a thing ever since. The one who told me this had seen the girl himself many many times and he was called Tulli-Lars. He'd gotten that name from a family that had the Tulli name and lived up in N&#xF8;rre Harridslev.

    <annotation>The dance of the mound dwellers is widely attested (DS I 717, DS I 755; PJ 2.11). Witnessing the dance can be quite dangerous, since it can make a person elf wild (DS I 748 and 756). In this story, the dance is not particularly threatening, and the man has a mundane and utterly nonthreatening conversation with the mound dweller. The dance appears to be more of a going-away party than anything else.

     There are also numerous stories about the mound dwellers moving (DS I 1341). Often they move to distant countries (DS I 1340). Moving because of the ringing of the church bells is also widely attested (DS I 1356). Other stories suggest that the mound dwellers moved because people had made it impossible for them to steal (DS I 1354). Religious symbols--bells, praying and making the sign of the cross--mark the landscape as Christian, making it impossible for the supernatural beings to remain within it. 

     Jens Peter uses the unusual designation bj&#xE6;rgtrolde (mound trolls) to describe the mound dwellers, although he reverts to the more common bj&#xE6;rgfolk (mound folk) in his second reference. The term "trold" draws a linguistic connection between these creatures and the witch in the preceding story (since witchcraft was legally referred to as trolddom), and emphasizes the connection between them and the devil. The close connection to the devil explains why the ringing of the bells and the sign of the cross are efficacious in driving them away.</annotation>

    <annotation>The nisse is the guardian spirit on Danish farms (Feilberg 1918). In Danske sagn, there are over two hundred stories about nisser (nisse, pl. nisser; household spirits). 

     The farmhand's fight with the nisse is ill-advised because, like most supernatural beings, the nisse is given to extreme reactions. Putting the farmhand onto the upturned blades of the harrow is reminiscent of the farmhand's treatment of the mare in Peder Johansen's story of a farmhand punishing the supernatural night mare (PJ 3.04). It is unclear what the sleep pin (s&#xF8;vnbron = s&#xF8;vnpr&#xF8;nne or s&#xF8;vnpryn, a slumber pin) that the nisse uses to put the farmhand to sleep is. Some stories suggest that a sleeping needle is a needle used to sew burial clothes and it can be used to put people into a magical slumber. The motif of a magical needle causing sleep is well known in European folklore, its best known manifestation being the spinning wheel spindle on which  Sleeping Beauty pricks her finger.

     Jens Peter uses the less common term gaardbo for nisse. Gaardbo literally means "something that lives at the farm." The name of the farm should be emended to read Hvidsted, a farm that figures in several of Jens Peter's stories (JPP 2.08, 2.09 and 2.13).</annotation>

    <annotation>Playing tricks on the nisse usually leads to retributive acts. Many stories attest to the contractual arrangement between a nisse and his farmer, in which the farmer provides the nisse with one humble meal a year (porridge and butter), and possibly a new set of clothes (DS II B 146). In return, the nisse guarantees if not the wealth then at least the success of the farm in the coming year. The contract stands as an extreme version of the standard contract between farmhands and farmers. In this context, it is worth noting that the term "nis" is a diminutive for the name "Niels," a common name for farmhands. The story also reflects the ambiguity related to negotiating contracts or engaging in transactions with members of an outside group.

     In this story, the nisse believes the farmer has underpaid him for his work. Other stories consider what happens when the farmer overpays, usually by giving the nisse clothes that are too nice for his social status (farmhand) (DS II B 214).

     The story of a nisse who kills the cow after not finding butter in his porridge is very common (DS II B 185). In some variants, the new cow tries to get back to its old farm or is otherwise confused about its new surroundings (DS II B 211). In some cases, the new cow is better than the one it replaced (DS II B 188). The stolen cow always comes from a neighboring parish, or even further afield. Theft outside of the community is apparently less problematic, perhaps because it does not impact the immediate economy. Crossing parish lines guarantees that the theft affects outsiders.</annotation>

But then one evening, the wife wanted to play a little trick on him and so she put the butter on the bottom of the bowl and the porridge on top of it. Well, the gaardbo gets so angry that there wasn't butter in the porridge and he goes out into the cow barn and kills the red cow. Then he goes back inside and is delighted with what he's done. But when he'd eaten the porridge, he finds the butter at the bottom of the bowl and he now regrets what he's done. Now he knew that over in Vollerup--those places north in Em parish--there was a red cow there exactly like the one that he'd killed. Then he puts the dead cow up on his shoulders and went over the heath that's called Skr&#xF8;ll&#xF8;s heath between Stenb&#xE6;k farm and Vollerup, that's full of stones and other junk. He pulls the live cow out and carries the dead cow in and puts it in place of the other one. That's how he came to Vollerup with the dead cow. The next day he went and talked to himself, "Oh, yeah, Skr&#xF8;ll&#xF8;s heath was long, and the red cow heavy, oh my back, I carried it." He went and complained.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Variants of this legend are grouped together under the rubric of "Pan's Death." The story is widely attested throughout northern Germany and Scandinavia (Bourgeaud 1979 and 1983). Liebrecht (1856) noted the similarity of this tale to Plutarch's story of Pan's death in De defectu oraculorum [On the disappearance of Oracles] (Boberg 1934, 7). Boberg, in her study of the Nordic variants of the story, proposed four main groupings: (1) Danish anthropomorphic supernatural beings (2) Danish cats (3) Swedish-Norwegian anthropomorphic supernatural beings and (4) Swedish-Norwegian cats (Boberg 1934, 14). Boberg observed that the death message generally results in an expression of sorrow in stories from groups 1 and 3, and an expression of joy in stories from groups 2 and 4 (Boberg 1934, 53). 

    Jens Peter draws an intriguing connection between the large tomcat who suddenly appears at the mill and mound dwellers. Although Boberg suggests that there are two distinct types of stories--one with mound dwellers, and one with cats--Jens Peter concatenates the two types here (Boberg 1934, 53). Interestingly, when a tomcat  appears in another of Jens Peter's stories, it is the devil in cat form (JPP 4.05).

     The cat is clearly disruptive in the mill, killing both of the other cats. Cats are important at a mill since they keep the very destructive mice at bay. This cat, however, eats far more than its share of food and is a far greater menace than mice.  The joy that the cat / mound dweller expresses at the otherwise incomprehensible message is paralleled by the joy and relief of the people at the mill when the cat leaves.

     Earlier interpretations of the legend have tried to connect the stories to ritual and cult practice, or to natural phenomena. Two nineteenth century German scholars, Wilhelm Mannhardt and G. A. Gerhard linked the story to the Sumerian-Babylonian god of fertility, Tam&#xFB;z, an analog to the Greek god, Adonis, and fertility cults. In contrast, Taylor linked the stories to sounds such as the wind in the trees (Boberg 1934, 9-10; Taylor 1922).

     None of these interpretations make much sense. Much of the narrative tension is related to the interaction between the supernatural being and the humans, and the humans are almost universally surprised to discover supernatural beings (or supernatural cats) living in their midst when they report the otherwise cryptic message. Once the death has been announced, the cat or supernatural being leaves, and the implicit thievery of the other world ends. Lindow proposes, in this connection, that a death among the supernatural beings is always a good thing for the human world (Lindow 2008).</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter connects the mysterious voices and messages from the previous story with this story of kidnapped sheep. The mound dwellers are the most likely culprits in this case, particularly given Jens Peter's comments about their thieving nature (JPP 4.09).

    The farm also happens to be threatened by disruptive haunts. Jens Peter implies a hierarchy in who can best deal with haunts, proposing cunning folk as the first line of defense, and wise ministers as the more powerful, second line of defense. Ultimately, the haunt is conjured, but unusual happenings ultimately lead to the financial ruin of the farm.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Here in a farm in the eastern most part of Jerslev parish, a strange thing happened about thirty years ago. Their sheep disappeared one night and all the people came out and were going to look for them. After a while, there's a shout: "We've found them now." That's what it sounded like to the people, and immediately after there was an answer, "Can I come in?" The man shouts and says yes. But they didn't find the sheep that night and they went about all night and looked for them and continued until dawn, then they found them. Then there was so much haunting on the farm and in the house, that the people soon wouldn't be able to stay there. Right nearby there was a big pond, and in the afternoon in broad daylight, wheels and half wagons and other things could appear in the pond, and no one could understand how it was happening. They sought out cunning people and even ministers--Jerslev minister was there several times--and after a while they managed to quiet it; but it was really there for many years. Sometimes fifty or so people could stand and watch as something rose up out in the pond. They got it stopped by using cunning folk, but it was really there for many years. None of the occupants wanted to stay at the farm and it was finally sold for next to nothing. When something appeared out in the pond it made strange noises and there was also quite a ruckus up in the house.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>St&#xF8;v-Karen is an ambiguous figure in Jens Peter's stories. On the one hand, she acts like a witch, threatening the farm and causing the death of the calf. The farmer's selfishness, however, may justify this response. In the other stories, St&#xF8;v-Karen acts more like a cunning woman, and is far more willing to help restore or protect both the physical and economic well-being of the local farmers. This ambiguity may well reflect the liminal space occupied by the cunning folk: they were at once revered for their ability to heal people and find lost and stolen things, and at the same time feared for their apparent supernatural abilities that, implicitly or explicitly, linked them to Satan (Tangherlini 2000). St&#xF8;v-Karen's inability to say "Christ" further links her to witches.

     In an earlier meeting with Tang Kristensen, Jens Peter told a variant of these stories (JPP 1.04 and 1.06); the intervening story of the sick farmer's wife is a new addition.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A woman lived in a house called St&#xF8;vhuset [Dust house] down here west of Vugdrup in T&#xE5;rs parish, and they called her St&#xF8;vkaren. Then she comes up to a house they called Stenbroen [Stone bridge] and wants some milk. The woman [of the house] says to her, "No, I can't today, because we have a calf and my husband won't eat veal unless it has been milk-fed. But in eight days we'll slaughter it and then you can come and get milk." Then the woman went away, but she had barely left before the calf got sick and began to jump up and down the walls and continued to jump until it had killed itself. It's no lie because my mother was there and grew up there. Then the man [of the house] gets mad and he goes off down to St&#xF8;vhuset the next morning and took a large staff in his hand. He meets her a little to the west where the poorhouse is now, and she came walking along with a pail in her hand. Before he got to her, she plants her staff in the ground and she turned herself into a crow and stood on the top of the staff and crowed. The man got so scared that he ran home and told his wife that as soon as St&#xF8;vkaren came, she should give her everything she wanted. Well, so then she comes soon after and the wife says to her: "Yeah, you better believe that we've suffered a big loss because of you." She answered: "Well Chri ... I can't do anything," (she couldn't say Christ properly). Well the calf had become crazy and had killed itself. Well, she was totally innocent of that. The wife gave her a lot of meat and bread and a bit of everything because they'd gotten scared of the haunting. She kept living at St&#xF8;vhuset for a long time. The woman in Vester Vugdrup got so sick and she lay in bed for a long time and she couldn't eat any of their own food. She could eat a little bit of other people's food (foreign food). It lasted for about half a year and she got so bad and couldn't do anything. Then they had a shepherd who took care of the sheep and he went down to St&#xF8;vkaren every day. Then she taught him her arts (and I know this because I've talked to him and he had to admit it to me). Then the woman in Vester Vugdrup got this boy to go down to St&#xF8;vkaren one day and ask her advice, if she could give her some advice, she could only eat foreign food and only a little bit of that. This boy was in good with this hag. He probably got some money for doing it well. Then the hag says to him, since it is you my little boy who comes and asks so nicely for his madmoder [foster mother], I'll help her. I've baked today and here is a new loaf of bread, it's warm, bring it home and give it to her. But tell her that she shouldn't eat too much, because she won't be able to handle it, she'll start eating now. Then she almost ate the whole thing at one sitting. It was at harvest time and the woman got better immediately after and became healthy. Then in the fall, their sheep disappeared down there in Vester Vugdrup, they were gone for five days, and they rode all over Taars parish and looked for them over by the church, but they couldn't find them. Then they have this little boy go down to her again and ask her if she knew where the sheep were. Sure, she could easily tell him that. Yes, they were standing out by a river in the area south of B&#xE6;stholm in Vrejlev, and they were completely surrounded by water on a little island and had been standing there for 5 days. But now I'll go and call to them. Then she took a bell in her hand and went out and started ringing it. Now you can go home and say that I've called them, they'll come back now. They thought that she was to blame because she was mad at them. Round about in the area they were afraid of her, she was an evil woman.</english_manuscript>

Det er ingen l&#xF6;gn, for min moder var der og blev opf&#xF8;dt d&#xE9;r.

    <annotation>Cyrprianus appears in several of Jens Peter's stories (JPP 2.06, 2.20 and 4.20). The Cyprianus, a book of magic spells and incantations, was considered to be a source of power in and of itself (Davies 2009, 123-132). It was closely related to the devil, and both witches and cunning folk, as well as wise ministers, were said to have possessed the book. Many cunning folk based their practice on ownership of the book alone (R&#xF8;rbye 1976).  In many stories, the book is used expertly to conjure ghosts, while in other stories, less than expert use of the book results in misfortune from the insignificant, as in this brief account, to utter calamity (JPP 2.06 and 4.20). 

     Narratively, Jens Peter brings the Cyprianus into his immediate sphere, indicating his own willingness to possess the book. In many stories, the Cyprianus is difficult to get rid of: it cannot be burned (DS VI 216), and it reappears even if one has tried to get rid of it (DS VI 222).

     Tang Kristensen collected copies of the Cyprianus, acquiring them whenever he had the chance. In Minder og Oplevelser, he writes about one of his copies of the book that was in a museum display in Copenhagen: "men betingede mig, at den skulde l&#xE6;gges saadan, at Folk ikke kunde komme til at blade i den eller overhovedet r&#xF8;re ved den. Det gik han ind paa, og der blev da lavet en Glaskasse til den, som den laa i og saadan opslaaet, at det Blad, hvorpaa der med r&#xF8;de Bogstaver var pr&#xE6;ntet Cyprianus, laa til Syne." [but I added the condition that it should be displayed in such a way that people could not browse in it or even manage to touch it. He went along with that, and a glass case was made for it, in which it lay opened to the page where the word Cyprianus was printed in red letters] (MO III 174). While Tang Kristensen was worried that his book would be damaged, he was equally worried that the contents of the book were dangerous (Rockwell 1982, 167 and 208).</annotation>

He told about one time he&#x2019;d gotten it down off the shelf and sat there reading in it. Just as he&#x2019;s sitting there, a sharpening stone which was sitting right next to him breaks in half and it made a really loud noise as if someone had shot a rifle right next to him.

    <annotation>The wolf hunter in this story is an interesting parallel to the elf hunter in one of Jens Peter's other stories (JPP 2.19). There are numerous legends that explain the absence of wolves in Denmark, attributing it to the actions of a witch who bargains for her head (DS VII 690). The unusual greeting occurs in other variants of this story, and is explained that, had the witch's interlocutor called the animals by name (wolves), they would have torn him apart (DS VII 696 and 700).

     In the late seventeenth century, witches were dealt with harshly. The Danish Law of 1683 includes the following stipulation for their punishment: "Befindis nogen Troldmand, eller Troldqvinde, at have forsoret Gud og sin hellige Daab og Christendom, og hengivet sig til Dievelen, den b&#xF8;r levendis at kastis paa Ilden og opbr&#xE6;ndis" [If any troll-man or troll-woman (witch) has been found to have rejected God and his or her Holy Baptism, and given him or herself to the Devil, then they should be thrown alive onto the fire and be burned up] (Bk 6, Ch 1, Par 9). The last witch trial in Denmark that ended in an execution by burning was in 1725, although the last execution of a witch was in 1800 (Henningsen 1975; Davies and Bl&#xE9;court 2004).</annotation>

    <annotation>Legends of buried treasure are quite common. The acquisition of great wealth without the proper input of work, such as occurs with successful treasure hunts or gambling, is related in these stories to antisocial behavior. The "absenting" from community implicit in the prohibition against speaking during the treasure hunt is a precondition for attaining great riches (from a clearly demonic creature). But the successful treasure hunt comes with a considerable downside: the destruction of the community, often represented by visions of the church or village burning. In this story, as in many of these stories, one of the treasure hunters breaks the taboo by speaking and the treasure sinks out of reach. But the community ties are reaffirmed. To emphasize the reestablishment of community, the handle of the chest is enshrined in the local church, a parallel to the use of the mound dweller's drinking horn to build a new church (KMP 1.61). 

     The verse the dragon quotes in this story is attested in several variant forms in Tang Kristensen's collection (DS III 2316; See also DS III 2318, 2320, and 2321). One of these variants was told by Gerhard Peter (G.P.) Andersen, who is mentioned in relation to one of Jens' stories about merfolk (DS III 2316; JPP 4.02). In some variants, witnesses see the dragon relocating, along with the treasure, from the mound to the lake. The buried treasure in the lake offers a clear parallel to stories of church bells in lakes (PJ 3.14; DS III 527, 529, 531, 533, 535). They too are often difficult to get up, but in those stories, the community's godlessness is often at the root of their inability to reacquire this clear symbol of community.

     The motif of a dragon guarding a treasure is best known from the V&#xF6;lsunga saga, where Fafnir, transformed from man into dragon, jealously guards his horde, only to be slain by Sigurd.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is a more elaborate variant of the would-be ghost story Jens Peter had told in his first session with Tang Kristensen (JPP 1.07). The formula that the minister uses in both variants is almost identical, with the addition of the conjunction s&#xE5;. The other direct speech episodes--the farmhand's final plea and the minister's powerless response--are also nearly identical. The only major change is the minister's interjection of "Gud bedre mig" [God save me]. Unlike the first version, the minister provides a justification for his late night peregrinations in the cemetery; this justification should have been enough to satisfy his wife, but she persists in her efforts to disrupt his tireless work to protect the community. As in the first version, the minister's wife loses her mind when she hears of the death of the farmhand. Jens Peter also adds a narrative intensifier, linking the story directly to his grandfather.</annotation>

Then she gets the coachman to put a white sheet over himself one night--my grandfather knew both the farmhand and the minister--and he runs ahead of the minister and goes out into the cemetery and runs in front of him from one grave to the next pretending to be a ghost. After the minister had gone and looked at this for a while, he says, "If you're a person, then speak, but if you're Satan, then get out of the way!"

    <annotation>Jens Peter retells a story about the improper use of the Black Book (Cyprianus) (JPP 2.06). Unlike in the first telling, this story does not comprise part of a longer series of stories about events at Baggesvogn, nor does it lead into another story about the Bragholt hag (JPP 2.05-2.07).

     There are some minor differences between the two versions, likely attributable to aspects of the immediate performance context. Several of the unbound phrases--particularly in relation to the three tears appearing in the boy's comforter--have been moved. Jens Peter adds additional detail in this variant, including the name of the room. Finally, he adds a coda about cleaning the room and the eventual need to physically rebuild the room to get rid of the haunting. As in the previous story, Jens Peter links the account to his immediate family. He does not provide a precise date (1808) as he had in the earlier telling. Johannes Kristoffer Nyholm took over Baggesvogn in 1837, purchasing it from the state for ninety thousand rixdollars. He was succeeded after his death by by his son, Hans Christian Nyholm, who kept the estate until 1880.</annotation>

Then she borrows some wise books from the Bragholdt hag and then she got two other women with her who were to help her with this. They go into a room in the farmhouse which is called the blue room and that's where they were and they set something up. They read in the books and read the Devil to them, he was to tell them who the guilty one was, but they never found out. One of the women who was along had a son at the farm who was the ox hand and they wanted him along but he didn't want to. So the three were alone. A little later that night, screams were heard and then when they opened up in to them, all of the women lay there and were torn to stumps and pieces. Just at the moment they died, three tears appeared on the comforter on the bed in which the ox hand lay. He got really frightened and got up but then his mother was dead. The first one to come in and see it was my father's maternal aunt, she worked there. They couldn't plaster the blood spots on the wall over. But when Nyholm got there, he tore the entire wall down and then when new stones were put up, it stopped.</english_manuscript>

They go into a room in the farmhouse which is called the blue room and they set something up and they read in the books and read the Devil to them. He was to tell them who the guilty one was, but it was never cleared up. One of the women had a son at the farm who was the oxhand and they wanted him along but he didn&#x2019;t want to. So the three were alone. A little later that night, screams were heard and then when they opened up, all three women lay there and were torn to stumps and pieces. Just at the moment they died, three tears appeared on the comforter on the bed in which the oxhand lay. He got frightened and came up, but by then his mother was dead. The first one to come in and see it was my father&#x2019;s maternal aunt, she worked there. They couldn&#x2019;t plaster over the blood spots on the wall, but when Nyholm got there, he tore the entire wall down and then when new stones were put up, it stopped.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The cursed oxen of the previous story (JPP 4.20) lead to this story of a successful conjuring of an evil ox. The evil ox is likely the devil in animal form (Woods 1959). The disruption of the farm is unmistakable in this story: the animals are in peril, and workers refuse to stay at the farm. The farmer himself offers a strategy that successfully drives the ox from the farm, and helps restore balance. The ox's fart lingers but causes no further damage.

     Magical harnesses are widely attested, largely in connection with witches and their ride to the sabbath (DS VII 443). In some stories, the cunning person attaches a magical harness to the haunt and leads it out to be conjured (PJ 2.02).

     Binding the ox with an elaborately crafted magical harness is reminiscent of the binding of the Fenris wolf in Snorri's Edda. In that story, the suspicious Fenrir is fettered with the magical harness Gleipnir crafted by dwarves out of the sound of a cat's step, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish and the spit of a bird (Faulkes 1995, 28). Given this and other obscure references to Scandinavian mythology in Jens Peter's repertoire, it might well be that he was familiar with the mythological stories that had been widely propagated during the nineteenth century.</annotation>

    <annotation>Villeinage and the devil are prominent features in this story. The two men, out late at night, are interested in getting home quickly, and so they borrow a convenient horse. Unfortunately, in a widely attested motif, the horse is actually the devil. Not surprisingly, hitching a ride on the devil's back turns dangerous, with riders either carried high into the sky (DS II D 109), or tossed into rivers or lakes (DS II D 99). In the latter case, it is usually young girls on their way home at night from a knitting room who climb the horse to ford a stream (DS II D 73). 

     In almost all cases, the horse is taken without permission. Generally, the horse is easy to catch, tempting the rider(s) to steal it. The resolution often mentions that the rider changes his or her behavior, suffers physically from the ride, or is marked for life from the encounter.

     Riding the easily caught horse with disastrous consequences is reminiscent of Einar's ill-advised riding of Freyfaxi in Hrafnkels saga (J&#xF3;n 1950). In that saga, Einar rides a horse that he has been expressly forbidden from riding and, as a result, he is executed. The punishment for stealing horses in nineteenth century Denmark was less extreme, although the Danish Law defined the theft of a farmer's horse as h&#xE6;rv&#xE6;rk (vandalism); the perpetrator would be fined and forced to pay compensation. 

     There is some confusion over the Captain's name. At the beginning of the recording (JPP 4.21), Tang Kristensen writes the name as Skj&#xE6;rul, but later in the manuscript, he uses the spelling Skj&#xE6;rulf. Although there is no division between this story and the preceding in the manuscript, Tang Kristensen splits the stories in his published versions and, because of this split, he adds some things, such as the reference to Linderumg&#xE5;rd in the first line, and deletes other things, such as the narrative connector, "Right after that..."</annotation>

    <annotation>The minister's failed conjuring leads him into direct competition with the devil. The race against the devil is a common motif, and Jens Peter had previously told another variant of this legend (JPP 2.16). In that variant, the minister raced the haunt rather than the devil. Racing with the devil often leaves its mark: in this case, the minister sacrifices two valuable horses to save his own life.

    <annotation>This is a variant of a story that Jens Peter had told previously (JPP 1.08). The differences between the two variants are interesting. In the earlier story, the emphasis is on the wise minister, who is identified and linked directly in the narrative to Jens Peter's own family. Easy external verification--at least of the minister--is suggested by the location of his tomb. In this later variant, the minister is not identified. The emphasis is placed on the man who reappears after death who is now identified as the miller (and accorded clear social status). His haunt returns specifically for his money. The motivation for the haunt in the earlier variant had to be interpolated. This variant also includes greater detail about the conjuring, but the location of the conjuring remains constant, as does the etiological tag identifying the stone that marks the spot.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter told a variant of this story in his second session with Tang Kristensen (JPP 2.15). There are several differences between the two accounts. While both descriptions of the manor lord focus on his poor treatment of the peasants, this later variant emphasizes the manor lord's reliance on corporal punishment and torture to keep them in line. The minister in the first variant is explicitly described as being "wise," whereas it is implicit in this variant. Perhaps the most important difference is the identity of the interloper--in the first variant, the low status miller's farmhand interrupts the conjuring whereas, in this variant, it is the high status miller. The poor judgment of the miller in this story resonates with that of the miller in the preceding story (JPP 4.24).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a manor lord at Boller, he was really strict with his peasants, he made them ride the wooden horse and the like and he used several other torture devices. The he got sick and was going to die. After him, a young owner arrived at Boller, but he couldn't stay there because the other one went and haunted there, and he wouldn't let him be in peace. They got a minister there to conjure him, and he got so far as to get him all the way to Boller water mill. It was at night, and they stood there and fought back and forth, because the manor lord was also somewhat learned; neither one would give in. The miller stuck his head out of the roof and wanted to watch what was happening. Then the manor lord almost got power over the minister and he was about to be forced into the mill pond. Then the miller got scared and pulled his head back in and crept into the mill. Now the minister got the power and was lucky enough to knock the ghost down. They were supposed to be the only two there while this was going on.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>In this story of a solicitous haunt, the minister's wife is complicit in the crime that leads to the haunting, a situation reminiscent of Jens Peter's stories of the would-be ghost (JPP 1.07 and 4.19). The minister's wife attempts to confront the haunt, but suffers from her lack of experience, an episode that parallels the more calamitous stories of the countess's inexperienced use of the Black Book (JPP 2.06 and 4.20).

     Tang Kristensen split the manuscript record into two stories even though there was no indication in the manuscript that Jens Peter did not perform the stories as an integrated whole. In the published versions, the interwoven account of Kr&#xE6;n Raadsig and Kristine H&#xF8;eg's engagement is turned into a seemingly independent story (JPP 4.27). 

     Abortion was a clandestine enterprise in the nineteenth century Denmark (R&#xF8;rbye 1976). Although cunning folk often prescribed herbal remedies to induce abortions, other practices that could induce a miscarriage, such as extreme physical exertion, were also common.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a Pastor H&#xF8;eg who lived in Ugilt and he baptized me. A farmhand who worked in the parsonage they called him Kr&#xE6;n Raadsig and he borrowed twenty-five daler from another farmhand who worked there and was from Budskov in Ugilt. He was drafted as an infantryman and went to Copenhagen. He is there for half a year, gets sick, winds up in the infirmary and dies. The parsonage madam was in on loaning the money to Kr&#xE6;n Raadsig because he was his daughter's boyfriend and they also got married and lived down in Bindslev parish. Well, then they ask about his death in Copenhagen, and then they figured the money had been paid back and nobody could think otherwise. His clothes and things were sent home to the family, but the money didn't come and the madam should have taken care of this. It's like this for a month but then a white ghost appears in the scullery of the parsonage, and the hired girls were terribly afraid of it. It continued to walk about out there every night for eight days. Then one night the madam goes down there just at the moment it tended to come because she also wanted to see it, she was going to show that she also dared to go down there, she said. But then it took hold of her and squeezed her, and she got sick. Then the minister learned about this and he went down there the next evening and talked to it, and the next day they made good on the twenty five daler. After that they didn't see the ghost again and there was peace in the farm. It was Kr&#xE6;n Raadsig's fault. Kristine H&#xF8;eg had gotten pregnant by Kr&#xE6;n Raadsig and then she danced so hard with my father one night around Christmas that she gave birth the next morning and the child died.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The ghost's New Years request for new hay is similar to the nisse's request for a bowl of porridge Christmas eve. In both cases, something supernatural appears at a liminal point in the calendar. Of course, finding new hay at New Years is more difficult than making porridge at Christmas. The haunt in this story appears as a black dog, a common form for haunts in Jens Peter's repertoire (JPP 1.05, 1.08, 1.09, 2.18 and 4.24). Moving the farm house is a drastic strategy for dealing with the haunt. The same strategy is employed at Baggesvogn after the violent death of the countess (JPP 2.06 and 4.20). Jens Peter's concluding remark links the events in the story directly to himself.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There's a farm in Ugilt called Dalsager. The man on the farm, the old Kr&#xE6;n Dalsager, he moved the main house three times to get rid of a ghost that haunted there. Every New Years eve a big black dog came there and his eyes were like the purest fire, that's what they said, those who saw it. It came and lay down in the scullery near the gutter. Those who saw him said that his eyes were like the clearest fire. They were supposed to have clean hay there every New Years eve and if he didn't get it, then people couldn't stay there at the farm. The dog would tip over the beds and threw them out of their beds and everything, and then he whined so he could be heard far away, there was quite a voice in that ghost. Then the man moved the house, but it was there again the next New Years eve. They lay down fresh hay in the scullery and then it was quiet. This ghost had such a reputation that none of the hired girls would go and put the hay down for it, and so he moved the house a second time, now he was sure that it would work out. But it was still the same. The haunting continued and they had to put hay down there again. But then the man moved the house for the third time and a bit farther away and then they were free of it.

    <english_manuscript>There was a robber who lived in a mound south west of Ugilt church called Daniel's mound, because he was called Daniel. He took people up and took their money and killed them, and he was supposed to have killed several hundred like that.

But then they got a lot of people together and they overwhelmed him eventually and caught him, before he'd eaten the third heart. He had it in his mouth.

    <annotation>This legend is closely related to Jens Peter's story of buried treasure (JPP 4.17). Unlike that more elaborate story, this one is a simple summary of events. The action takes place at a different mound, and the ring is housed in the more religiously important church in the market town of Hj&#xF8;rring. The folk etymology for the town name derived from the found treasure is a common feature of many stories of supernatural contact (KMP 1.19). 

     The name Kloonh&#xF8;j, identified in the topographical index as Klovnh&#xF8;j, should be emended to Klovenh&#xF8;j, a mound several hundred meters to the north and east of Hj&#xF8;rring church.</annotation>

The town is supposed to have gotten its name from this, since it was originally H&#xF8;jring.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Stories of Holger Danske are widely attested (DS II G 317 and 334; Thiele 1818-1823; M&#xFC;llenhoff 1845), and his test of the mettle of the Danes is a common motif in these stories (DS II G 324). Other stories mention that Holger Danske will wake up to help defeat the Turks (DS II G 323). Defeat and bankruptcy were certainly close at hand throughout most of the nineteenth century.

     The figure of Holger Danske is also widely attested in Danish ballads (DgF 30), and was frequently connected to the figure of King Diderik (DgF 7 and 16). Christiern Pedersen's "The Chronicle of Holger Danske" appeared in 1534, and the first printed attestation of the ballad of Holger Danske can be found in Vedel (1591). Several fourteenth century sources refer to an early Danish king named &#xD8;dgerd or Ozzyari (DgF 30). In the fourteenth century Old Norse redaction of Kejser Karls Kr&#xF8;nike one finds the story Oddgeirs &#xFE;&#xE1;ttr. 

     Holger Danske has had significant staying power as an icon for Danish nationalism, outstripping the allure of Niels Ebbesen (PJ 2.16). There is a 1907 statue of a sleeping warrior in the casemates of Kronborg by the sculptor  Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan (b. 1859-d.1939); the name Holger Danske was used  by the Navy for a steamer (1850-1873) and a frigate (1945-1959); and by the most famous division of the Danish resistance during WW II.</annotation>

The man who owned the mountain, he was called Klaus and had a farmhand who was called Jens and one morning he tells him to go out and break stones up on the mountain. After he'd broken a number of stones he gets to a big flat stone and when he picked it up he found a burial chamber underneath it. Then he noticed that there was an old man sitting down there sleeping with his arms around a chest. He tells the farmhand to give him his finger so he can feel if there's still power in the Danish blood. Then he reaches a metal rod (pry bar) out to him and he crushes it to pieces. Well, it wasn't too bad yet, the Dane's still had some bone, and then he said that the chest he was sitting on was filled with money and it was to be used to buy Denmark back when it fell into enemy hands.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Stories about being kidnapped by the mound dwellers are common (DS I 869). While some stories attest to the victim returning to human society (DS I 897), and others to the victim's desire to stay with the mound dwellers (DS I 898), it is uncommon for the kidnapped girl to reappear at the farm, discuss her fate with her father, and then disappear again. Here, the girl acts not so much as a kidnap victim but more in the manner of an innocent, solicitous haunt, asking her father to stop grieving over her absence. 

     The second story confirms the link between the mound dwellers and haunts, since bloody spades are a more common feature of stories about murder that will out than those about mound dwellers (DS IV 1391).

     Children were confirmed twice a year, and the ceremony was one that people were likely to attend even if they otherwise did not attend church on a regular basis. This explains why the old father is home alone. It also provides the liminal timing that is a common feature of supernatural encounters.</annotation>

So the old man was home alone one Confirmation Sunday, and her sister and her husband were at church. Then she comes in to him around eleven or twelve with a platter of warm meat and says, "Here's some warm meat for you, dad." - "Where are you now, my girl?" - "I live west of here in the mound," she says. - "What do you do there?" - "I'm married and have three children." - "Well, stay here now," he says, "it's probably best that you stay here with us now." No, she wanted to go home to her children, and after that they never saw her again. Anton Koldbroen comes from that family that lived in that farm. The girl was called Ane and was Anton's grandmother who dug in the mound fifty years later, and the spade became completely bloody and then she got scared and let it be.

    <annotation>The unusual phrase that is shouted from inside the mound is similar to the nearly incomprehensible death message in the Pan's Death legends (JPP 4.12). In this case, the girl has unwittingly placed herself over the mound dwellers' chimney (smoke hole), and they need to chase her away so they can continue their work. The story, then, is closely related to stories of the mound dwellers' baking and confirms that mound dwellers live in a society quite similar to human society.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a minister who lived in Elling who was called Mr. Thomas. He had a coachman called Daniel who was both wise and crazy. One day, when they were driving to church, the coachman says to the minister, "There's a girl going along the street, she's my sweetheart, but I don't really like her, because she's both twisted and off kilter, what does Father think of her?" Yes, he thought she was nice enough. But the coachman didn't think so and it ended up that he fell in love with another girl and was going to get married to her. Then the minister says in the marriage vows, "Here the crow has found one like him, one that is neither twisted nor off kilter nor hooked on her ass." The coachman got what was coming to him there and after that they got a real set of marriage vows. Another time they were driving to Tolne church, which was at that time an annex, the minister said to the coachman, "I'd like it if you went out to the butcher who lives next to the church and get a piece of meat for me." He went too but the butcher said that he could tell the minister that when he'd paid for the last piece of meat he'd gotten then he could get some more. Well, now the coachman comes into the church and the minister was preaching from Daniel's book and he says, "Well, what does Daniel say?" The coachman gets up in his seat and says, "Daniel said that when the minister has paid for what he'd received then he could get some more." The butcher was called Daniel. They get home and the minister scolds him for saying that in church and almost disturbing him. But they worked it out. He used to go about on the weekdays thatching with a cotter. One day they'd gone over to Raabj&#xE6;rg to thatch at a big farm close to Aalb&#xE6;k. A stranger had come to the farm to visit and then he said, "Who are those two men you've got thatching?" "Well, one of them is called Thomas, but he's given himself another name, he calls himself the Temmerbasse from Niib, and the other one is called Kristen Pedersen."-"Hey, for christ sake, you're no poor man's minister, when it's the Temmerbasse from Niib." "I sure am, because I'm just as good a minister for poor things as for the poor." Well, then he could also get them to thatch his place. Sure, that could be arranged, and he got them to do it too. The stranger wanted to tease the minister, because he knew him, but he didn't want people to know that right off. He was supposed to have been a remarkably capable minister, and also quite straightforward.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der boede en Pr&#xE6;st i Elling, som kaldtes Hr. Thomas. Det skal have v&#xE6;ret saa udm&#xE6;rket en Pr&#xE6;st, og saa saa ligefrem. Han brugte at f&#xF8;lges med en Husmand hen at t&#xE6;kke paa de sogne Dage. Saa var de en Gang kommen hen i Raabj&#xE6;rg at t&#xE6;kke, i en stor Gaard t&#xE6;t henne ved Aalb&#xE6;k, og da kommer der en fremmed Mand til Gaarden i Bes&#xF8;g. Han kjendte nu godt Pr&#xE6;sten, men vilde ikke lade sig forstaa med det fra f&#xF8;rst af. Saa siger han: "Hvad er det for to M&#xE6;nd, du har at t&#xE6;kke?" "Ja, den ene han hedder Thomas" siger Manden, "men han giver sig et andet Navn, han kalder sig Temmerbassen fra Niib, og den anden hedder Kr&#xE6;n Pedersen." &#x2014; "Hej Pined&#xF8;d," siger den fremmede Mand, "saa er det int Fattigmands Pr&#xE6;st, naar det er Temmerbassen fra Niib." Det sagde han for at skose Pr&#xE6;sten, men han svarte der oppe paa Huset: "Jo saa mins&#xE6;l er a saa, for a er ligesaa godt Pr&#xE6;st for de rige som for de fattige." Ja, saa kunde han vel ogsaa faa dem at t&#xE6;kke. Jo, det kunde godt lade sig gj&#xF8;re, og han fik dem ogsaa.
     Han havde en Kusk, der var baade klog og gal. En Dag, da de kj&#xF8;rte til Tolne Kirke, som den Gang var Annex, saa siger Kusken til Pr&#xE6;sten: "Der gaar en Pige henne paa Vejen, det er ellers min Kj&#xE6;reste, men a lider hende ikke rigtig, for hun er baade skak og skj&#xE6;v. Hvordan synes Faaer om hende?" Ja han tykte godt nok om Pigen. Da tykte Kusken det ikke, og Enden paa det blev, at han fik sig en anden. Saa kom Tiden, han skulde giftes med hende, og saa siger Pr&#xE6;sten i Brudevielsen: "Her har Krage funden Mage, som hvikken er skak eller skj&#xE6;v eller krogen til djer R&#xF8;v." Saa fik Kusken det, og da han nu havde faaet det, han skulde have, saa kom der bagefter en ordentlig Brudevielse.
     En anden Gang de kj&#xF8;rte til Tolne, sagde Pr&#xE6;sten til Kusken: "Du kan gj&#xE6;rne gaa ind til Slagteren, som boer ved Siden af Kirken (han hed netop Daniel), og faa et Stykke Kj&#xF8;d til mig, ilav a holder Tjeneste." Han gik ogsaa, men Slagteren sagde: Han kunde hilse Pr&#xE6;sten, at naar han betalte de sidste Stykker, han havde faaet, saa kunde han faa noget mere. Naa, saa kommer Kusken ind i Kirken med den Besked, og da var Pr&#xE6;sten ved at pr&#xE6;ke ud af Daniels Bog. Saa siger han i det samme: "Naa, hvad siger saa Daniel." Kusken rejser sig op i Stolen og siger: "Daniel sagde, at naar Pr&#xE6;sten betalte, hvad han havde faaet, saa kunde han faa noget mere." Da de saa kommer paa Hjemvejen, bebrejder Pr&#xE6;sten ham, at han havde sagt det i Kirken og n&#xE6;r forstyrret ham i Pr&#xE6;kenen. Men det blev jo da godt imellem dem igjen.</danish_publication>

They once had a cask of mead that had gotten too old and a thingamajig they called a basilisk grew in the mead. It thrashed about so much in the barrel that they were afraid it was going to break. It was supposed to be so dangerous that, as soon as it broke the barrel and it saw a person first, they would die. But they drove it out and dug a big hole and buried it in an embankment at Spangerhede. They could hear it knocking about down in the barrel for a long time, almost a whole year and then it got strangely quiet. Then that shit was dead.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The witch in the form of a hare appears frequently in Danish legends, often in connection with her being shot (DS VII 128). There are other stories that attest to a witch named Rut traveling in the shape of a hare (DS VII 119).

     In this story, the witch is closely related to the large landholding class, working in the direct service of the aristocrat. The connection between large estates and the devil (and his servants) is also widely attested. The story has an interesting resonance with Jens Peter's story of the young witch whom the chamberlain and the minister discover (JPP 4.08). In that story, instead of employing her for their own gain, they re-baptize her and restore her to the community. Such is not the case in this story; instead, the elderly shepherdess is forced to run errands for the wealthy land owner. Clearly, the rich do not have the best interests of the poor at heart.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is yet another variant of one that Jens Peter had told before (JPP 2.07). It is slightly more elaborate than the earlier one, including added detail about Iver Holmen's route to Bragholt and his important status in the community as both parish bailiff and superintendent of the military district. The devil's outburst, "He hears!" is identical in both variants, although it is only repeated twice in this version of the story.

    <english_manuscript>Eighty years ago a man lived on Knudsholmen in Ugilt they called Iver Holmen, he was both a parish bailiff and a superintendent for a military district. Then one night, one hundred and twenty feet of canvas disappeared and they looked far and wide for this canvas, but they couldn't find it. Then he goes to this here Bragholdt hag and wants her to show it again and asks her advice. He gets over there and also manages to talk to her. Then she says: "You can come tomorrow," then she'd tell him where his canvas was. The man didn't like this, it was a long way from Bragholdt to Holmen, and he had to go over Asted bridge north of the farm Egebj&#xE6;rg.

He lies down in some hay and packs himself in, then he'd be there in the morning. Ivar hears during the night that two come into the barn, and the hag was one of them and then a little man. He can hear that she has a dishcloth in her hand and that she's good and drunk, and she smacks this little guy hard in the head with the dishcloth. He was supposed to tell her where the canvas was. Then he yells, "He hears! He hears!" She was so drunk that she didn't hear what the little man said and she continued to beat him so he had to tell her. It lay in a sink hole in the minister's field east of Holmen. So, as soon as they'd left the barn again, Iver Holm goes back home and finds his canvas and he was happy. But the next day the repercussions came. A message came from her that he should come over, she wanted to talk to him and then he had to pay what she wanted.

    <annotation>The motif of a witch churning butter from cream stolen from all the local farmers is widely attested (DS VII 609). Humorous stories in which people accidentally claim huge amounts of butter from local cows are also common (DS VII 608). Jens Peter tells other stories in which witches milk cows to death or otherwise imperil a farm's livestock (JPP 1.02. 1.04, 4.14, 4.44). 

     The witch's theft of cream from all the farmers for her own personal gain makes clear her threat not only to the individual farmer, but to the community as a whole. While in some stories, tailors are suspicious characters, mostly they play the role of buffoon. The burlesque of the farmwife helping the tailor take off his butter filled pants is reminiscent of stories of extramarital dalliance.

     Ane Marie tries to strike a bargain with the tailor, that he is not to tell anyone about her magical churning, but her bargain is no more effective than the threat against speaking that the minister makes to his confirmation class (JPP 1.09). Jens Peter makes use of these meta-narrative comments to great effect throughout his storytelling, implicitly explaining how he has come to know as many stories as he does.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A man lived in Ravheden, his wife was called Ane Marie. They had brought a tailor to the farm and it was old Ib the tailor, an old funny guy. He sat on the table and sewed and the farmwife was going to churn. So she sets the churn on the living room floor beside the wood burning stove and she was going to do it there but goes out to the kitchen again. When she comes back, she has a slip of paper in her hand and something was written on it. She puts this under the bottom of the churn and goes out into the kitchen again. Then the tailor jumps down from the table and grabs this here slip of paper. He wanted to read it but didn't have time to because the farmwife comes in at the same time and he stuffs the slip of paper down his pants and the farmwife begins to churn. After she'd churned for a quarter of an hour, the tailor yells out: "Stop, my dear woman, because now my pants are so full of butter, they can't hold any more." Well, then she helped him off with his pants and they were totally full, it was quite a sight. "Now I'll give you five rixdollars, if you'll keep quiet about this." Yes, he promises that, and then he gets the five rixdollars. After they'd gotten the pants clean, he saw what was written on the slip of paper and there was written that she wanted a spoonful of cream from each man in the parish who had cows. But the only thing he forgot was to be quiet because the first place he came to sew he told what had happened with the hag. The tailor was really pockmarked and we knew him.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Even though they were common accident on Danish farms, knife cuts were not a trivial injury because they could lead to serious infection and death. The use of worked metal--particularly sharp metal such as knives and blades--to cure is closely linked to the belief in their efficacy against supernatural beings, and their ability to "bind" possessions of the other world. It may be that these metal tools represent a human "value-added" component to nature, and symbolically suggest human control of the environment and, in particular, the earth.</annotation>

    <annotation>Jens Peter's story of the wise curate resonates with his stories of witches, cunning folk and wise ministers. The linked stories reveal Jermiin's remarkable magical power. Encircling things frequently has magical efficacy, and is a common approach to stopping wildfire in Danish legends (DS VI 1199). Tang Kristensen attributed two other stories about Jermiin's ability to stop wildfires to himself (DS VI 1204 and 1206).

    The second story in this recording combines aspects of showing again and binding thieves. Although forcing thieves out of a small opening, usually in the window lead, is attested elsewhere, it is more common to force Satan out of such an opening (DS VI 478). The thieves, however, are no ordinary thieves, stealing the very emblems of the church that are related to ideas of community and salvation. Accordingly, they can be seen as Satanic themselves.

     As he does in several stories, Jens Peter includes a coda that ties the story into his immediate sphere, here linking the story to a woman whom he knew well. The place name Serridslev should be emended to Serritslev. The Store Vildmose was an enormous swamp seventeen kilometers southwest of Serritslev. It is now much smaller than it once was; large parts of it were drained and sold as small holdings in the late nineteenth century.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a curate in Serridslev and lived in the annex farm, he was called Jermiin and was very wise. Then the big Vildmose had caught fire and burned for nine or ten years. It burned both winter and summer. Then he said that he could stop the fire easily, he could be at home in the parsonage and stop the fire but he didn't want to because then people would think he was involved with witchcraft. But now they could drive with him up to the fire. Then they drove out to the fire and then he drove around it but he sat in the wagon. There had never been a swamp fire like that in Vendsyssel. Then there was a theft in Vr&#xE5; church, and the thieves stole both the chalice and the drinking vessels and everything. Now there was a rural dean in Vr&#xE5; at that time, and he wanted two ministers with him in the church to see the other one show it again. But as they went in there, Jermiin says that now he'd show them something they'd never seen before and that they'd never want to see again. He went over and took a needle, at the time there were leaded windows in the church, and he poked three holes in the lead. Then he told them that to notice who the thieves were, they were to go through the holes in the window. The curate and the two ministers got really frightened. The curate said that he wished never to see it again. But they got all their silver back again. The curate knew all three thieves and it was three cotters from Vr&#xE5; parish and I also heard their names.

    <annotation>Jens Peter's story about the invisible mound dwellers includes an internal discussion of belief: is the farmhand's description of the mound dwellers true or not? Ultimately, the wise minister accepts the boy's claim, but only after he has substantial proof. Jens Peter gives no details as to how the wise minister kept the mound dwellers at bay later. The mound dwellers' eventual retreat from the district aligns well with stories of mound dwellers being driven away by church bells (JPP 4.09). Ironically, here they are attracted by bells--the supper bell.

     It is interesting to note that, in Jens Peter's later sessions, he includes stories that occur at a much greater distance from his home than in earlier sessions. Horne, for instance, is seventeen kilometers north of Ilbjerge huse.  Nevertheless, all his stories take place north of the Limfjord.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A minister over in Horne complained all the time that the people on the farm used too much food and he could never keep them if that kept up. This was at least a hundred years ago. There were two or three large mounds on the parsonage's field, and they believed there were probably mound dwellers in them, but they didn't know for sure. One day he had a shepherd boy watching the sheep, the minister used to graze a lot of sheep. He was lying up there on the mounds at lunch time one day. Then they ring for lunch down at the parsonage. Then they shout down inside the mound, since it turned out it was that mound that the mound dwellers were in, "Now they're ringing down in the parsonage, now we need to get our hats out." Then all these little hats come out of a little hole in the mound. The boy thought that these were some nice hats and so he shouts, "Let me have one too." All the hats disappeared, all except one, and the boy got that one. Well, he put it on, and he gets up and goes home and was going to have his lunch. He comes in and sits down at the table and keeps the hat on. Then he could see that there sat all these little guys with hats on in between all the people and ate just as fast as they could. None of the people could see them because they had their hats on. Well, he gets up again and nobody had seen him either because he had a hat on. Then he comes home driving the sheep that evening, they didn't know he'd been home. Then the people say to him, "Why didn't you come home and have your lunch today?" He was a real rough guy and he swore up and down he'd been there. Well they didn't believe him because they hadn't seen him. "Yes, there were also a lot more people at the table, it was a group of little people up from the mound. You couldn't see them because they had hats on, but I could see them. They swore that was a lie. "Yeah, I also had a hat on and that's why you didn't see me either." Then the minister found out and the boy said to him: They could either borrow the hat or the minister could see it. So he got it. When he put the hat on, the people at the farm couldn't see him either. Then the minister thought: there's probably something about this hat and so he shows up to lunch the next day. The ones from the mound had come as well and he saw how they ate much more than his people. Then he understood how the food was never enough, and since the minister was a wise man, he made it so that they couldn't come and eat there any longer. Then the mound dwellers left the district because, since they didn't get any food, they couldn't stay there, and they didn't notice them anymore.</english_manuscript>

Det var en grumme vigtig Kn&#xE6;gt, og han bandte saa, han havde v&#xE6;ret der. Ja, de troede det ikke, for de havde ikke set ham. "Jo, der var ogsaa mange flere Folk ved Bordet," sagde han, "det var en hel Del Smaafolk oppe fra H&#xF8;jen. I kunde nok ikke se dem, for de havde deres Hatte paa, men a kunde se dem." De bandte paa, det var L&#xF8;gn, han sagde: "Ja, a havde ogsaa en Hat paa, og derfor saa I vel heller ikke mig." Saa fik Pr&#xE6;sten det at vide, og Drengen sagde til ham: Han kunde enten faa Hatten at se, eller ogsaa kunde de faa den at laane. Saa vilde han laane den. Da han fik Hatten paa, kunde Folkene paa Gaarden heller ikke se ham. Saa t&#xE6;nkte Pr&#xE6;sten: der maatte lige godt v&#xE6;re noget ved den Hat, og han m&#xF8;der da selv ved Spisningen n&#xE6;ste Middag. Da var de m&#xF8;dt igjen der oppe fra H&#xF8;jen, og han saa, hvordan de spiste meget mere end hans Folk. Saa kunde han forstaa, hvorfor Maden ikke kunde forslaa, og da Pr&#xE6;sten var en klog Mand, saa dannede han det saadan, at de kunde ikke komme der mere at spise. Saa rejste Bj&#xE6;rgfolkene fra den Egn, for da de ikke fik Mad, kunde de ikke v&#xE6;re der, og siden m&#xE6;rkede de dem ikke.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A minister over in Horne complained all the time that they used too much food for the people on the farm; and he could never keep his hired hands if that continued. This was at least a hundred years ago. There were two or three large mounds on the parsonage&#x2019;s field, and they believed that there were probably mound dwellers in them, but they didn&#x2019;t know for sure. The minister had a lot of sheep that would graze and he had a shepherd who would guard them. The shepherd was lying up there on the mounds at lunch time one day, and then they ring to lunch down at the parsonage. Then they shout down inside the mound, since it turned out it was that mound that the mound dwellers were in, &#x201C;Now they&#x2019;re ringing down in the parsonage, now we need to get our hats out.&#x201D; Then all these little hats come out of a little hole in the mound. The boy thought that these were some nice hats and so he shouts, &#x201C;Let me have one too.&#x201D; All the hats disappeared, all except one, and the boy got that one. Well, he put it on, and he gets up and goes home and was going to have his meal. He comes in and sits down at the table and keeps the hat on. Then he could see that all these little guys with hats on were sitting there in between all the people and ate just as fast as they could. None of the people could see them because they had their hats on. Well, he gets up again and nobody had seen him either. Then he comes home driving the sheep that evening, and the people say to him, &#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t you come home and have your lunch today?&#x201D; He was a real rough guy and he swore up and down he&#x2019;d been there. Well they didn&#x2019;t believe him because they hadn&#x2019;t seen him. &#x201C;Yes, there were also a lot more people at the table,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;it was a group of little people up from the mound. You couldn&#x2019;t see them because they had their hats on, and that's why you didn&#x2019;t see me either.&#x201D; Then the minister found out and the boy said to him: He could either see the hat or he could borrow it. So he wanted to borrow it. When the minister put the hat on, the people at the farm couldn&#x2019;t see him either. Then the minister thought: there&#x2019;s probably something about this hat. And so he shows up to lunch the next day. The ones from the mound had come as well and he saw how they ate much more than his people. Then he understood how the food was never enough, and since the minister was a wise man, he made it so that they couldn&#x2019;t come and eat there any longer. Then the mound dwellers left the district because, since they didn&#x2019;t get any food, they couldn&#x2019;t stay there, and they didn&#x2019;t notice them anymore.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Stories of a farmer inadvertently damaging the roof of a mound dweller's house are common (DS I 593). Mikkel is at first unwilling to listen to the complaint, and insists that he is the owner of the mound. His decision to help the mound dweller is akin to the farmer's decision to repair the peel board in stories of the mound dweller's baking (JPP 4.04). In this case, the mound dweller acknowledges the contractual arrangement and pays rent to Mikkel for the use of the mound. Mikkel's goodwill in repairing the mound and accepting the mound dweller's rent payment is also repaid. Indeed, the mound dweller begins to act in a manner reminiscent of a nisse, the guardian spirit of a farm.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man over in Horne called Mikkel, he was used to always losing a lot of his animals. One day he started driving peat from a mound he had on his field back home to his dung heap. He'd driven quite a few loads during the day, something comes to his window at night and shouts, "Mikkel, Mikkel." He answers, "Yes, what is it?" Well, he needed to thatch their house again, the one he'd taken the roof off of during the day, because they were freezing. No, he answers, he hadn't done that, he hadn't taken the roof off of anyone's house. Yes, he'd taken peat from the hill. Well, he says, he wouldn't bring the peat back, since he paid taxes and rent for the mound just as for his other property. Well, he could tell them how much tax he paid for that land, they'd pay him back. He didn't know. Well, he'd better thatch their house again, otherwise it would go bad for him. The next morning he started driving some of it back to the mound again, and he leveled it and brought it back into shape. After that, every morning when he got up, there was a little hole in the window, just big enough for a four shilling piece to fit through, and every morning there was a four shilling piece in the window. That was to cover his expenses with the mound. About three or four days later, he was taking his afternoon nap, and someone comes to the window and shouts, "Meggel, Meggel, your foal that is standing a bit to the north here has gotten tangled in its harness, and it is dying." He jumped up and got the horse out of the harness and saved it, and it got better even though it was really in bad shape. A little later he yet another foal which had gotten tangled in the reins and it had fallen down into a ditch and was lying on its back and was just about dead. They came and told him that too, and it went on like this, and so after that time he never lost any horses or cows or anything, they came and told him when something was wrong.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Norwegians and, to a lesser extent, Finns, are often attributed magical power in Danish tradition (DS VI 926). While some have argued that the "Norwegian" in theseis actually a S&#xE1;mi, there is little evidence in any of these stories that support this surmise. Instead, it is likely that this explanation obtains in Sweden and Norway in reference to Finns, where farmers would have been in contact with S&#xE1;mi, but not in Denmark, where meeting a S&#xE1;mi would have been a truly unusual event.

     The curse undermines the already shaky economy of the farm, an economy made all the shakier by the burden of the farmer's villeinage at &#xC5;strup (the farm is presumably a leasehold under the estate at &#xC5;strup). The farmer's generosity to the wandering Norwegian leads to a reciprocal relationship, similar to the one between the farmer and the mound dweller found in the preceding story (JPP 4.43). The curse on the farm is a fairly typical witch's curse, and is intended to destroy the farm's economy. The form of the curse relies predominantly on contagious magic, with the bones and skin of the animals used to control and kill the farm animals. Not surprisingly, the witch turns out to be a neighbor, and the neighbor witch begging to be let in is a widely attested motif (DS VII 1357).

     As in many of his stories, Jens Peter vouches for the veracity of the story by emphasizing his personal connection to someone in the story, or someone who knew someone in the story.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man in N&#xF8;rre-Harridslev, he did villeinage at &#xC5;strup in west Hj&#xF8;rring, he lost a huge number of animals, both horses and cows and sheep and pigs and geese and ducks and chickens, in short, everything that he had and so he was incredibly poor. He had four horses, but two of them were so thin and weak that they couldn't do anything. They hung in some ropes and were near death. The man was supposed to go to L&#xF8;kken with a load of grain for the manor lord and had to have these two horses harnessed up. At the time an old Norwegian had come here to the country, he was cunning and could cure such things. He was supposed to have helped many others. Then there were some who'd told him about this farmer and how bad off he was. He goes over there and comes on the evening that the man was out driving to L&#xF8;kken and wanted to talk to him about that. But the man wasn't home then. Then he asks the farmer's wife if he can't stay there that night. No, she says no, that couldn't be done. They were poor people and couldn't afford to have strangers lodging with them and she was harsh and chewed him out. But he just kept sitting there since people had told him to stay until the man came home. Later that night the man comes back from L&#xF8;kken and he gave the Norwegian permission to stay there, it was too late to leave now. He had a bottle of akvavit along home from L&#xF8;kken and they sat there and emptied it that night and were feeling good. Then this here old Norwegian became a little more talkative. Then he says, "How is it that you lose so many cattle and horses?" Well, he couldn't stay at the farm, he says, he was about ready to leave it any day now, because he lost everything, and it was probably evil people who were at fault. Well, then the Norwegian starts to talk and says, "There's a remedy for that."--No, says the man, he'd given a lot of money to have it cured and there'd been a lot of cunning folk. "Well, let me stay here tonight," says the Norwegian, "then we can take a look at it tomorrow morning." He stayed there and the next morning, they got up and he says to the wife, "Take an entire basket of peat and make a fire in the fireplace." Yes, she'd do that. "Well, then we'll go out to the barn and see if we can't figure out a remedy for this." The Norwegian went back and forth in there and then he pointed at a large stone that was lying there in the stone floor and they were to pull it up. No there wasn't anything under it, they could put it back down. Then he went back and forth a couple of times, and then he says, "It should be here," there was also a big stone in there. They got a metal bar and lifted the stone. Underneath it there was a hole big enough to fit a couple measures. There were also all sorts of bones, both horses and cows and pigs and the like, and there was hair from them too, and there were bones and feathers of chickens and and the like and tied onto these hairs were so many bad luck knots that the cunning man filled a two bushel basket when he'd gathered it all together and carried it out. Then the Norwegian calculated by looking at all that that it could have lasted for another hundred years that they'd lose animals at that farm before it would have ended. They carried it into the kitchen. Then they had to shut all the doors and windows tightly and plug all the holes in the main room, because now they were going to throw everything that was in the basket onto the fire, and the evil-doer would come immediately. It wasn't too long after all those things and the bones were on the fire before their neighbor's wife came and really wanted to come in, and she yelled and screamed, she really needed to talk to them. But she wasn't allowed to because the Norwegian was afraid that it wouldn't help if she came in, and so she wasn't allowed in. After that filth had been burned to ashes, they carried it out to the dunghill and they never lost a thing again and he became a clever man and his grandchildren have the farm to this very day. The one who told me this knew the man personally.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en mand i N&#xF6;rre-Harridslev, han gjorde hoveri til &#xC5;strup vesten Hj&#xF6;rring og var da s&#xE5; rasende fattig.

Nu havde han fire heste, men de to var s&#xE5; magre og afkr&#xE6;ftede, at de kunde da ingen ting bestille, de hang i nogle rebe og var d&#xF8;den n&#xE6;r. S&#xE5; skulde manden til L&#xF8;kken med et l&#xE6;s korn for herremanden og m&#xE5;tte jo have de to bedste for. Nu var der i den samme tid kommen en gammel Nordmand her over til landet, det var &#xE9;n, som var klog og vilde kurere for s&#xE5;dant noget, og han havde da hjulpet mange. S&#xE5; var der nogle, der havde sagt til ham om denher g&#xE5;rdmand, og hvor elendig stillet han var. Han g&#xE5;r s&#xE5; dertil og kommer netop den aften, som manden var ude at kj&#xF8;re til L&#xF8;kken, og vilde snakke med ham om det. Men da manden nu ikke var hjemme, s&#xE5; forlanger han af konen, om han kunde ikke f&#xE5; lov at blive der i nat. Nej, hun siger nej, det kunde ikke lade sig gj&#xF8;re; de var fattige folk og havde ikke r&#xE5;d til at have omrejsende fyre i losi. Se, hun var jo kras og skj&#xE6;ldte dygtig ud; men han bliver lige godt siddende der, og folk havde nu ogs&#xE5; sagt til ham, han skulde blive, til manden kom hjem, hvis han ikke var til stede i &#xF8;jeblikket. S&#xE5; hen p&#xE5; aftenen kommer manden fra L&#xF8;kken, og han gav Nordmanden lov til at blive der, det var jo for sent at g&#xE5; nu. Nu havde han en flaske br&#xE6;ndevin med hjem fra L&#xF8;kken, og den sad de og t&#xF6;mte om aftenen og blev s&#xE5;dan godt tilpas, og denher gamle Nordmand blev noget mere snakvis. S&#xE5; siger han: "Hvordant er det med dig, du mister jo s&#xE5; mange h&#xF6;veder og hester?" Ja, han kunde ikke blive ved g&#xE5;rden nu, siger han, han var f&#xE6;rdig til at g&#xE5; fra den, hvad dag det skulde v&#xE6;re, for han mist' jo al ting, og det var nok onde folk, der var skyld i det. Ja, s&#xE5; tager Nordmanden ordet og siger: "Det kunde der vel og r&#xE5;des bod p&#xE5;." &#x2014; Nej, siger manden, han havde givet mange penge ud for at f&#xE5; det kureret og v&#xE6;ret ved mange kloge m&#xE6;nd, men det hjalp jo lige meget. "Ja, nu bliver a jo her i nat", siger Nordmanden, "s&#xE5; kan vi se p&#xE5; det i morgen tidlig." Om morgenen, de kom op, siger han til konen: "Nu skal du tage en hel kurvfuld torv og gj&#xF8;re ild p&#xE5; arnestedet." Ja, det skulde hun nok. "S&#xE5; vil vi g&#xE5; ud i n&#xF8;dset og se, om vi kan ikke finde &#xE9;n ting r&#xE5;d for dether." Nordmanden han gik frem og tilbage der inde, og s&#xE5; viste han p&#xE5; en stor sten, der l&#xE5; inde i pikningen. Den skulde br&#xE6;kkes op. Det skete, nej, der var ingen ting under den, den kunde de l&#xE6;gge ned igjen. S&#xE5; gik han frem og tilbage igjen et par gange, og s&#xE5; siger han: "Her skal det v&#xE6;re." Det var ogs&#xE5; en sten, der l&#xE5; der inde, som han nu pegte p&#xE5;. De havde en st&#xE5;lstang og l&#xF8;ftede stenen, og der under var et hul s&#xE5; stort, at det kunde tage godt et par skj&#xE6;pper. Der var ogs&#xE5; alle slags ben b&#xE5;de af heste og k&#xF8;er og f&#xE5;r og svin o. s. v., og der var h&#xE5;r af dem, og der var ben og fjer af h&#xF6;ns og &#xE6;nder og gj&#xE6;s. P&#xE5; de h&#xE5;r var der knyttet s&#xE5; mange ulykkes-knuder, at den kloge mand fik en toskj&#xE6;ppe-kurv helt fuld, da de fik det hele samlet sammen og fik det b&#xE5;ret ud. Han regner ud ved at se alt det, at det kunde have varet et helt hundrede &#xE5;r, inden det fik ende, s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge skulde de alts&#xE5; have haft mist p&#xE5; deres kreaturer. De bar det nu ind i kj&#xF8;kkenet, og s&#xE5; skulde de lukke b&#xE5;de d&#xF6;re og vinduer t&#xE6;t og stoppe alle huller p&#xE5; rollingen, for nu kom alt det p&#xE5; ilden, der var i kurven, og s&#xE5; skulde deres skademand nok komme lige straks. Det varede heller ikke svar l&#xE6;nge, inden deres nabokone kom og vilde endelig have v&#xE6;ret ind, og hun r&#xE5;bte og skreg, hun skulde endelig snakke med dem. Men det m&#xE5;tte hun jo ikke komme for Nordmanden, han frygtede, det skulde ingen held have, n&#xE5;r hun kom ind, og s&#xE5; kom hun heller ikke. Efter den tid det skidt var br&#xE6;ndt i aske, s&#xE5; bar de det og benstumperne ud p&#xE5; m&#xF8;ddingen, og siden mistede de aldrig nogen ting. Han blev en dygtig mand, og hans b&#xF8;rneb&#xF6;rn er ved g&#xE5;rden den dag i dag er. Den, der har fortalt mig det, har kjendt manden personlig.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a man in N&#xF8;rre-Harridslev, he did villeinage at &#xC5;strup in west Hj&#xF8;rring and so he was incredibly poor. He lost a huge number of animals, both horses and cows and sheep and pigs and geese and ducks and chickens, in short, everything that he had, and there had to be evil people at play. Now he had four horses, but two of them were so thin and weak that they couldn&#x2019;t do anything, they hung in some ropes and were near death. Then the man was supposed to go to L&#xF8;kken with a load of grain for the manor lord and had to have these two horses harnessed up. At the same time, an old Norwegian had come here to the country, he was one who was cunning and could cure such things, and he&#x2019;d helped many others. Then there were some who&#x2019;d told him about this farmer and how bad off he was. He goes over there and comes the very evening that the man was supposed to drive to L&#xF8;kken and wanted to talk to him about that. But since the man wasn&#x2019;t home, he asks the farmer&#x2019;s wife if he can&#x2019;t stay there that night. No, she says no, that couldn&#x2019;t be done; they were poor people and couldn&#x2019;t afford to have strangers lodging with them. See, she was harsh and chewed him out; but he just kept sitting there, and people told him to stay until the man came home if he wasn&#x2019;t there at the moment. Then later that night the man comes back from L&#xF8;kken and he gave the Norwegian permission to stay there, it was too late to leave now. Now he had a bottle of akvavit along from L&#xF8;kken and they sat there and emptied it that night and they were feeling good and this here old Norwegian became a little more talkative. Then he says, &#x201C;How is it that you lose so many cattle and horses?&#x201D; Well, he couldn&#x2019;t stay at the farm, he says, he was about ready to leave it any day now, because he lost everything, and it was probably evil people who were at fault. Well, then the Norwegian starts to talk and says, &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a remedy for that.&#x201D;--No, says the man, he&#x2019;d given a lot of money to have it cured and there&#x2019;d been a lot of cunning folk, but it didn&#x2019;t help any. &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll stay here tonight,&#x201D; says the Norwegian, &#x201C;then we can take a look at it tomorrow morning.&#x201D; The next morning, they got up and he says to the wife, &#x201C;Take an entire basket of peat and make a fire in the fireplace.&#x201D; She agreed to do that. &#x201C;Well, then we&#x2019;ll go out to the barn and see if we can&#x2019;t figure out a remedy for this.&#x201D; The Norwegian went back and forth in there and then he pointed at a large stone that was lying in the stone floor. They were to pull it up. They did that and no there wasn&#x2019;t anything under it, they could put it back down. Then he went back and forth a couple of times, and then he says, &#x201C;It should be here.&#x201D; There was also a stone in there which he now pointed at. They got a metal bar and lifted the stone, and underneath it there was a hole big enough to fit a couple bushels. There were also all sorts of bones, both horses and cows and pigs and the like, and there was hair from them too, and there were bones and feathers of chickens and ducks and geese. Tied onto these hairs were so many bad luck knots that the cunning man filled a two bushel basket when he&#x2019;d gathered it all together and carried it out. He calculated that it could have lasted for another hundred years before it would have ended, that&#x2019;s how long they would have lost animals there. They carried it into the kitchen and then they had to shut all the doors and windows tightly and plug all the holes in the main room, because now everything that was in the basket was thrown onto the fire, and the evil-doer would come immediately. It wasn&#x2019;t too long either before their neighbor&#x2019;s wife came and really wanted to come in, and she yelled and screamed, she really needed to talk to them. But she wasn&#x2019;t allowed to because the Norwegian was afraid that it wouldn&#x2019;t help if she came in, and so she wasn&#x2019;t allowed in. After that filth had been burned to ashes, they carried it and the bone stumps out to the dunghill and after that they never lost a thing. He became a clever man and his grandchildren have the farm to this very day. The one who told me this knew the man personally.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Robbers threaten civil society as a whole. In this story, it is a manor lord, rather than a farmer, who is the victim. The poor swineherd who is taken hostage emerges as the most important figure in the story. The village people are understandably more concerned about saving one of their own than saving the manor lord's pigs. Amusingly, the robbers have sold most of the pork by the time they are captured. The rhyme that the swineherd sings is reminiscent of several other rhymes that appear in Jens Peter's stories. It is also akin to some of the rhymes that trolls sing in fairy tales that inadvertently reveal their identity.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a manor lord at Kj&#xF8;lske who was called Ole L&#xE5;nng, and he had a house out in the woods, because at that time there was a big woods at Kj&#xF8;lske and there was also a swineherd with the the swine. There were a lot of swine. But one day the swineherd and the swine disappear, and they searched and searched in the woods and to the south and north, east and west, but they could find neither swineherd nor swine. It was like this for four months. Then the manor lord and his wife went for a walk in the garden, and they hear music from the forest that was right there. It was really audible and then the manor lord says to his wife, "My swineherd isn't dead yet, I can hear him playing." He'd been taken prisoner with the swine by some robbers and they had a den down in the ground and there was a really big birch bush and they could pull it back and forth and it lay over the den and they could put it over it, then no one could find it, because all the robbers down there were otherwise butchers. Then the swineherd played, "Wolle L&#xE5;nng, Wolle L&#xE5;nng, your swineherd has been taken prisoner, all your swine have been slaughtered, except for the big spotted sow, and they're taking her now, they're taking her now." Then Ole L&#xE5;nng calls for his barn master and two or three farmhands jump up on horses and go out to ask all the inhabitants of Hallund parish, they were lease holders, and they were to meet at the farm the next morning at 5, and then they were to go out and look in the woods. But they searched the woods three times before they found the robbers' den and they were all gathered down there. All the people were known and they had driven about and sold all the pork from his swine except for this one spotted sow which had just been slaughtered. They were all executed and the robbers' den can still be seen today. It's on a farmer's field in Hallund, he's called Lars Laden, and it's there to remind people. The swineherd hadn't been hurt.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Elves are generally solitary figures and are associated with small stands of woods, often near streams. This association builds on a folk etymology that proposes a common stem for the word for elves, "ellefolk", and the word for alder wood, "elletr&#xE6;" (AMJ 2.15 and KMP 1.60). Elves' backs are frequently described as looking like rotted tree trunks, an image that at once causes the human to recoil in disgust and reaffirms the close connection between these beings and nature, particularly forests (DS II A 59). The dance of the elf women that Kirsten Marie describes is similar to the dance of the mound dwellers who also attempt to seduce or kidnap humans into their community (PJ 2.11).

     The food that the elf woman offers the man is reminiscent of legends about the mound dwellers' baking (Boberg 1938). In those legends, however, the food offered is part of a well-structured barter transaction (Tangherlini 1998). In this case, the food is offered more as a gift; since the man has no history of interaction with this out group member, he is rightfully suspicious of the implications of the gift, particularly since elves are also seductresses (Mauss 1967).

      The forest ranger's reaction--to cut a cross in the cake with his knife--is a common strategy to counter the potentially threatening supernatural gift. Here the threat is threefold, manifest in the pancake and the elf woman herself. The food may well be poisonous (as the food of the other world often is) and thus it could threaten the man's physical well-being. The woman may not only be attempting to disrupt the forest ranger's economic activity by distracting him with sex, but also may be trying to derail the normal ability of a community to perpetuate itself. The ranger's action serves at once as an expression of man's control over nature, in the form of the knife made out of worked metal, and the expression of the religious (Christian) nature of the human community, in the form of the cross he cuts in the cake. The efficacy of his action is clear, as it eliminates both the threat of the food and the threat of the woman.</annotation>

    <annotation>Nothing noteworthy happens in this story. Instead, it relies on several key concepts in Danish folklore for its reportability. The concept of the outsider is addressed in the unusual gate that the manor lord and lady are forced to drive through, associating the island of Funen in a peculiar way with the conceptual category "outside," as the whale bone gates and the seemingly windowless house indicate otherness. Class differences are apparent on two levels: the story is reported not by the manor lord or lady, but rather by their servant, the coachman. His attitude toward the mistress in particular may be read in the reported direct speech of the mistress on seeing the condition of the house. She is pleasantly surprised by the hospitality of the farmer's wife, a form of narrative criticism in that the upper class discovers that the lower farming class (to which Kirsten Marie belonged) was perhaps not as "below" the aristocracy as they would have it. The privy councilor and the lady are also brought down a social notch in the short exchange between them. Not surprisingly, it is the coachman who makes sure that they are well-quartered for the night. The lady's expression--Bong wahrhaftig--is not commented on by Tang Kristensen nor is it glossed by Feilberg. The unusual nature of the expression serves to further set apart--and ridicule--the lady.  Klavsholm (Clausholm) is the same castle that Ane Margrete Jensdatter mentions in the conclusion of one of her ballads (AMJ 1.02 and 4.02).</annotation>

"Oh little mother, you're sitting damn well (Let the devil come into me)." When they got out and came to a place and went to look around, there weren't any windows, they were on the other side. So they knocked on the door, and a little later the housewife came and opened the door and asked them in. "Oh, Rasmus, we can't possibly stay here tonight," she says to the coachman.

    <annotation>Regulations limiting begging and laws concerning the treatment of the poor, along with a delineation of class differences, animate this amusing story. Kirsten Marie frequently recounts the adventures of her father in her storytelling. In this case, her father plays a good-natured trick on the beggar bailiff, the man charged by the local authorities with keeping beggars from outside the parish away. The beggar bailiff was generally chosen from local people receiving poverty assistance. This primitive form of control over the movement of itinerant beggars was intended to keep the burden of poverty assistance at a reasonable level throughout the parish.

      Kirsten Marie's obvious delight in her father's antics that indirectly challenge the local governing board, while directly teasing the low status beggar bailiff, reveal her attitudes to a relatively complex series of status divisions functional in late nineteenth century rural Denmark. Kirsten Marie's father is, at the time of the events, a hired hand, and only incrementally better off than the beggar bailiff. His masquerade as a beggar enacts this tenuous divide. By contrast, when Kirsten Marie tells the story, she sees herself as a farm owner's wife, and thus narratively parallel to the farmer's wife who provides alms for the false beggar and the beggar bailiff. The farmwife in the story is narratively powerful, aware of the identity of the false beggar and firm in her protection of him from the otherwise justified actions of the beggar bailiff, Rasmus.

     The story enacts an amusing twist with Kirsten Marie narratively allowing her (and her brother Rasmus's) father to toy with an officer of the poverty assistance board, thereby questioning the efficacy of that office. In this context, it is worth noting that Kirsten Marie's brother, Rasmus Kj&#xE6;r, was an important figure in local politics at the time she told the story.

     The second part of the story where Kirsten Marie's father steals the beggar bailiff's food is reminiscent of a well known contemporary legend in which a person mistakenly eats someone else's food, often on board a train or at a cafeteria (Klintberg 1986; Zola Christensen and Christensen 2001). Those stories, referred to in Danish under the rubric of "Snylteren," rely on a twist: the main character believes a person is openly and aggressively stealing his or her food but subsequently discovers that the apparent thief was actually the victim. Once the tables are turned, the smug protagonist is mortified over his or her breach of social etiquette and the theft.

     By contrast, in this story, there is no significant question of etiquette; rather, the false beggar is crass and deliberately aggressive, as is the beggar bailiff. The beggar bailiff never has an opportunity to regret his subsequent actions, since he never discovers the underlying ruse. 

      The concept of theft functional in this story is more complicated than in the contemporary legend, since it depends on an economic interpretation of begging. Begging was seen by some as a form of theft: the receipt of goods without payment or any service rendered. In the story, that equation is made explicit in the actions of the false beggar: the theft of food right off the plate of the beggar bailiff, the person charged by the community with protecting the borders from the incursion of foreign beggars, read thieves. Yet, here, the beggar is not what he appears, and the underlying "theft" associated with begging is revalued by the farmer's wife, who proposes charity. 

     The false beggar makes explicit the implication that begging is thievery in his provocation of the beggar bailiff who reacts accordingly. His reaction, however, is rebuffed by the farmer's wife, and the beggar's bailiff is forced to relent. The farmer's wife, through her actions, paradoxically endorses a position of local charity that countermands the office of the beggar bailiff, an office that was based on the premise of surveillance, control and punishment (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940; Foucault 1979). The narrative focuses on the charitable act of the farmer's wife rather than on the implicit and explicit thievery of the (false) beggar.

     There is little difference between the manuscript version and the published version. In the published version, Tang Kristensen moves the reference to the beggar bailiff to the beginning of the story's orientation, downplaying the emphasis Kirsten Marie places on her father. Kirsten Marie--or perhaps Tang Kristensen--introduces a degree of confusion into the story at the end, accidentally referring to her father as "Rasmus," the name that she has been using for the beggar bailiff throughout. The name is dropped in the published version.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>My father worked at Stubdrup and there was a beggar king (stodderkonge; beggar bailiff) in Nielstrup. Then my father thought, "I'll put on some old clothes," and pass himself off as a beggar (st&#xE5;kelsmand). Now when the beggar bailiff came over the hill, he'd arranged it so that he could just make it into the farm in Stubdrup where he worked. When the beggar bailiff got there, he asked, "Wasn't there a beggar just here?" "Yes, there was" says the farmwife, "he ran off to Drostrup as fast as he could." So then he ran over to the Drostrup farms and asked about him there too. "Yes," they said, "he just went over to the other farm." So he went over there. "Yes," said the farmwife, "he just left for Hallendrup." Then the beggar bailiff ran off after him again, until he was wheezing but then my father he ran back to Stubdrup and in to the other farm. When he gets in there now, the farmwife had made a wonderful soup for lunch. The beggar (st&#xE5;kelsmanden) says hello. The farmwife recognized him immediately. "Oh sit down and have a spoonful of soup." So he sat down and then the beggar bailiff arrived. "Are you here you bastard (kanalli)? You damn well better move yourself out of here." Then the farmwife says, "No, sit down Rasmus and have a spoonful of soup with him and figure this out." Then they sat with each other and ate soup. The first spoonful that the beggar bailiff took, the other beggar reached out and took the chunk from him. He took it from his spoon like that several times. Then he thought, "Well, if I can't have any soup, then I can take a piece of meat." When he'd gotten that, my father took that off his plate. Then the beggar bailiff got angry and grabbed my father by the scruff of the neck, he was going to throw him out. When they got to the door, my father fell down in the foyer, and the beggar bailiff fell down on top of him and then he held on to him. Then he screamed and said that the beggar bailiff was going to kill him. "Oh God," said the farmwife, "let him go Rasmus." Finally he got up and then Rasmus ran over to the other farm and took his clothes off, and then he wasn't a beggar anymore. The beggar bailiff never found out who he was.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Even after the constitutional reforms, the minister was an important member of the community, playing an important, albeit somewhat lessened, role in local political organization (N&#xF8;rr 1981). 

      Stories about minister's wives are quite common. Often, she is in league with the devil or, in less extreme cases, scandalous in her behavior (DS VII 149). Calling her "Mr. Dorrit" is, of course, derogatory. By contrast, her husband, the minister, is described as a man of great virtue.

     The preservation of the minister's corpse after "Mr. Dorrit" plagues him to death is reminiscent of the miraculous preservation of the incorruptible bodies of Catholic saints, such as St. Bernadette. The minister's seeming animation after death would usually be seen as a form of haunting but, here, because of his virtue, is seen in a positive light. Certain beliefs closely linked to Catholicism, such as belief in incorruptible bodies and ghosts, continued to be expressed in storytelling despite the Reformation and the strong influence of the Lutheran church in everyday life. 

     In the published version, Tang Kristensen moved the place name reference to Voldum from KMP 1.06, and printed the two stories together, jumping over KMP 1.05 which he published as a separate story.</annotation>

    <english_publication>There was a minister&#x2019;s wife in Voldum, they called her Mr. Dorrit, she was a terrifying woman, and she hit her hired girls and starved them and was a terrible wife. She was first married to Mr. Niels, and then he died, and she married his successor, Master Laust. She had children with Niels Brun, and she and the children as well were so bad to Laust that he couldn&#x2019;t stand them. One day, when he stood in the pulpit in Rude church, he said goodbye to his parishioners. He said that the Lord should take him now, because he couldn&#x2019;t live here on earth because of his step-children and wife. And he died right after that and didn&#x2019;t get up to the pulpit again. But he lay in his casket for fifteen years with red cheeks. Then his cheeks lost their color and people believed that he was supposed to have lived for those years, if he&#x2019;d been allowed to live out his years.
      [When Dorrit was dead, she went again and was conjured down in the cellar. When the hired girls went down there, they were always afraid of touching or breaking the pole that had been driven into the ground above where Dorrit had been conjured down.

    <annotation>There are numerous variants of this story attested in Danish tradition (Tangherlini 1998; DS V 686). As in her previous stories, Kirsten Marie endorses a strategy that challenges extant power structures, in this case that of the Lutheran church. Much of the power of the Lutheran church was taken over by local landholders, including farm owners such as Kirsten Marie's brother Rasmus.

     Here, the powerful ministers--three of them no less--are unable to conjure the ghost. The lower ranking curate, however, has little difficulty in conjuring the revenant, who is a constant disruption at the farm, and thus a threat to the local economy. Conjuring a revenant in a barn is not uncommon. Revenants are also frequently conjured down into the embankments of mill ponds.

     The repartee between the revenant and conjurer is common in many variants of the story, and always revolves around the conjurer's youthful transgression of stealing out of necessity rather than greed (DS V 694). Paying back this debt during the conjuring allows the conjurer to gain power over the ghost.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie returns to the revenant of Dorrit in the context of a story about conjuring. Rather than describing the actual conjuring, Kirsten Marie describes the aftermath. The pole marking the spot where Dorrit was conjured serves as a constant reminder to the threat she posed to the functioning of the household, particularly the well being of the hired girls. It is fitting, then, that the spirit is conjured in the storage cellar. While Dorrit's threat is greatly diminished, it is still possible that she will return.

The published version conflates this manuscript recording with KMP 1.04.

    <annotation>The supernatural powers of Master Laust, the minister whose body was uncorrupted after his death (KMP 1.04), come to the fore in this story, a variant of a widely attested conjuring legend (DS V 804, 809). The requirement to say "in the name of Jesus Christ" or some other religiously charged formula protects the farmhand from driving off with a Satanic being who, presumably, would be unable to utter such a religiously powerful formula. When the carriage cannot budge, Master Laust forces the ghost to serve as the fourth wheel of the wagon and they return quickly to the parsonage. In other variants of this legend, it is Satan who is forced to act as the fourth wheel (DS VI 323). The Lutheran church, to combat widespread belief in ghosts, made ghosts theologically acceptable by equating them with Satan (Tangherlini 1999).

     In other variants of the legend, the farmhand tries to witness the conjuring, resulting in the minister's momentary loss of power over the powerful revenant (DS V 730, 744). As in the story of Dorrit, Kirsten Marie provides no details about the conjuring. Conjuring a ghost in the cemetery is not surprising, as the cemetery is the most obvious resting place for the dead.

    The story concludes the series of stories that revolve around Mr. Dorrit, Master Laust and local ghosts.</annotation>

    <annotation>The ghost's disruption of economic activity could not be clearer than in this story. The other farmhand is twice threatened: his work as a shepherd is disrupted and he is forced to work as a plowman for the other world. The act of plowing can also be read in the context of fertility and, accordingly, the ghost can be seen as a threat to the fertility of the community as well. 

     Neither farmhand develops a strategy for dealing with the revenant, other than running away. It is fortuitous that the farmhand escapes with only a fright. The refusal to mention the revenant in the church is puzzling, as one would imagine that the church would provide a degree of protection against this supernatural intrusion.

     Tang Kristensen added the line "it's him that I'm named after" at the beginning of the published version of the story. The addition of this line makes an erroneous attribution of the story to Kirsten Marie's brother, Rasmus Kj&#xE6;r.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie turns a skeptical eye toward the purported abilities of cunning folk and the widespread belief about curses and witchcraft. Deaf Lars's status is only incrementally better than that of a beggar. Many poor people survived partly through begging and partly through doing small jobs such as glazing, which were not prohibited by the trade laws. Glarmesterfolk (glaziers) was a common appellation for itinerant tinkerers and along with tatere (gypsies) and natmandsfolk (refuse collectors, literally "nightmen"), glarmesterfolk were often lumped under the overarching category of k&#xE6;ltringer. This category included vagabonds, itinerant tinkerers and beggars. The word "k&#xE6;ltringer" later became synonymous with "con artists" (Gaardboe 1968, 12-13). 

     Sidsel Rollands' status as a wandering beggar--and a loose woman-- also aligns well with Kirsten Marie's critical stories about beggars and members of poorer classes. In this case, the beggars are represented not only as free riders, but also as dangerous con artists.

     The hare that Sidsel allegedly sees would be a "milk hare," a common figure for witches either to assume or to send to collect milk from local farms (DS VII 268 and 584). Witches often steal milk and cream, perhaps the clearest manifestation of an economic product derived primarily from female coded activity, from all the local farms for their own personal gain (DS VII 576). 

     The farmer and his wife appeal to the community for help to pay for Sidsel's services. While she pretends to protect the farm (and by extension the community) from the threat of the witch and milk hare, she herself is actually the threat. This narrative switch is the crux of the story, where the protector turns out to be the threatener.

     The prohibition against talking about the alleged cure is reminiscent of prohibitions against speaking while seeking buried treasure, an act that separates the treasure diggers from the human community (PJ 2.09). Here, the silence guarantees Sidsel some time to work her con. She even alludes to burying the money as a prophylactic against the return of the hare. It is worth noting that Sidsel, unlike the witch, steals money, a reflection of the rapid shift away from an informal economy based largely on real goods, toward a thoroughly monetized economy: This shift took place in the last decades of the nineteenth century in rural Denmark.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>It was in M&#xF8;rke and Deaf Lars and a woman he had wound up spending the night there. He apparently wasn't married to her, because he was separated from his real wife. He was a glazier and he drove around here with the woman and the children he'd had both with her and with the other one. After they'd spent the night there, and the farmwife was out milking, she says to Lars, he was so deaf: "It's not quite right here Lars, a hare ran through here last night." "So what," he said. "These poor people, they're unlucky." The woman who is milking hears this and she runs in to her husband and these people out here say so and so, shouldn't we find out what is going on? Sure. "What is it you've been talking about? Are we unlucky?" Then Sidsel said yes. "What should we do?" Well, she'd tell them what to do. They should dig a hole by their bed, and she should be given 20 rixdollars, but they couldn't tell anybody about it. Then they went around in town and borrowed the money and started to dig near the bed, and there she found, so she made it seem, a mole skin that was filled with stones. They were to burn that and the money was to be buried instead. The people otherwise didn't find out what kind of monster it was. They had to feed them for many days, but then the townsmen noticed and made sure that they chased them away. Sidsel Rollands was put in jail. She'd taken the money.</english_manuscript>

Sidsel said that she&#x2019;d buried the money, but that wasn&#x2019;t true; they&#x2019;d taken the money and the people on the farm had to feed Sidsel and Lars and the kids for many days. Finally the townsmen noticed what was going on, and they made a big deal out of chasing Deaf Lars and his gang away. Sidsel Rollands was put in jail because she was the one responsible for the whole thing.</english_publication>

    <annotation>In the narrative guise of the farmer, Kirsten Marie expresses skepticism over the the curse and its cure. At the same time, she leaves open the possibility that buried treasure, hauntings and curses exist. As with many of her other stories, this story focuses intensely on the economy of the farm. The farm is threatened by an unspecified curse. The cunning man who is called to stave off the threat proposes a course of action that is overtly rejected by the farmer. But the subsequent success of the farm, and the son's suspicions, imply that the farmer followed the cunning man's advice in secret. </annotation>

    <english_manuscript>My grandfather said that at a farm in Nielstrup there'd been a thing. They always had bad luck with their animals and so they sought out a cunning man. He said to him: "You should look in your parlor, there's a hole in the floor, and where that hole is, you should dig down and find a kettle of money. But you can't stay at your farm that night." The man answered and said that it would never happen that he'd dig for it. But their son, he believed nevertheless that they had dug for it, because he'd never seen as much money as they had. It was quiet at the farm, but no one ever really found out whether he had dug or not. That farmhand also told as if it were true that some times after he'd been in town in the evening and had come home, the horses would stand and sweat. When he went up and fixed their manger, it looked like as if there were small piglets lying there, and he carried them out to the mud pool, but in the morning it was good straw that he'd carried out.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Although not specifically identified as Satan, the dog who appears is clearly a supernatural beast (Woods 1959). The snow shovelers are most likely local farmers who were required to help maintain the local roads up until 1848. The requirement to assist in maintaining and building local roads was one of the most detested obligations that accrued to farmers because of their legal status as peasants.

     In the field diaries, this story and the preceding one (KMP 1.10) are not separated.</annotation>

    <annotation>The story relies on Johanne's unusual pronunciation and strong dialect for its humor. The final phrase is the funniest, as it draws attention to the unusual choice of godfather and godmother for the young boy, and the unusual decision to church Johanne on the same day as the boy is baptized.

     Baptism was supposed to take place on the first Sunday after the birth in the local church (Steensberg 1964 vol. 1, 43). Women were churched--or accepted back into the church after the birth of a child--much later, usually six weeks after the birth (Steensberg 1964 vol. 1, 42). Accordingly, what Johanne proposes in this story is out of the ordinary. Implicit in the story is an attitude of condescension, both on the part of Kirsten Marie and on the part of the paternalistic minister, toward Johanne and her husband.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A man and a woman come and want there child in church in Rud. It was while Pastor Buhman was minister and he would always go into my grandfather's house and change his clothes and so that's where these people come. Then the wife there at the house asks the woman, "Where are you going today?" - "We want to have our little boy in church." - "Who is going to carry him?" - "I'll do that, little D&#xE5;rrit." - "Well who is going to take his hat off?" - "Well, you'll do that little D&#xE5;rrit. I also want to be churched today." - "Well, who is going to follow you to church, Jahan?" - "Well, you'll do that too little D&#xE5;rrit." "Well, I don't know about that, if we can do all of that, Jahan. Who is going to be the baptismal witness?" "Well Kr&#xE6;sten's gone up to the church to get a hold of someone." Then the house wife goes up to the minister, at that time they called him "Father," and she says to him: "What does Father say to that? Jahan has come and wants to bring her boy to church, and she wants to carry him herself and she wants me to take the cap off, and she also wants to be churched and have me stand beside her. Do you think we can do that, Father?" - "Yes, we can certainly do that D&#xE5;rrit," says the minister. So when they get up there and they're standing by the baptismal font, she almost forgot what the child was named. When they left the church, she says, "Wow, you could easily have forgotten what the child was to be named, Jahan." Then she cleared her throat and spit and said, "It got caught in my throat little D&#xE5;rrit." Then she said to the boy, "Now little Kristjan, now you can say, di f&#xE5;e h&#xE5; w&#xE5;tt di faje, di m&#xE5;we di b&#xE6;&#xE6;rm&#xE5;we."

Then the wife there at the house asks the woman visitor, &#x201C;Where are you going today?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;We want to bring our little boy to church.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Who is going to carry him?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do that, little D&#xE5;rrit.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well who is going to take his hat off?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, you&#x2019;ll do that little D&#xE5;rrit. I&#x2019;m also going to be churched today.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, who is going to follow you to church, Jaahan?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, you&#x2019;ll do that too little D&#xE5;rrit.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, I don&#x2019;t know about that, if we can do all of that, Jaahan. Who is going to be the baptismal witness?&#x201D; &#x201C;Well Kr&#xE6;sten&#x2019;s gone up to the church to get a hold of someone.&#x201D; Then the housewife goes up to the minister, he was putting on his vestments and was going to go up to the church, they used to call the ministers &#x201C;Father&#x201D; in those days, and she says to him: &#x201C;What does Father say to that? Jaahan has come and wants to bring her boy to church, and she wants to carry him herself and she wants me to take the cap off, and she also wants to be churched and have me stand beside her. Do you think we can do that, Father?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, we can certainly do that D&#xE5;rrit,&#x201D; says the minister. So when they get up there and they&#x2019;re standing by the baptismal font, she almost forgot what the child was named. When they left the church, she says, &#x201C;Wow, you could easily have forgotten what the child was to be named, Jaahan.&#x201D; Then Jaahan cleared her throat and spit and said, &#x201C;It got caught in my throat little D&#xE5;rrit.&#x201D; Then she said to the boy, &#x201C;Now little Kristjan, now you can say, di f&#xE5;e h&#xE5; w&#xE5;tt di faje, di m&#xE5;we di b&#xE6;&#xE6;rm&#xE5;we.&#x201D; &#x201C;your father has been your baptismal witness and your mother your carrying mother (godmother).&#x201D;</english_publication>

    <annotation>In 1808, Napoleon sent five regiments totaling fourteen thousand Spanish troops to Denmark to assist in a proposed French-Danish invasion of Sweden, an ally of England. They were quartered throughout Denmark, including Kolding, where they accidentally burned down the Koldinghus castle. While most Danes were anxious about the arrival of these troops, given their bad experiences with the Polish troops in the late seventeenth century, the Spanish troops turned out to be much better guests. The troops were eventually evacuated by the British, once they discovered that their fellow Spaniards were engaged in a guerrilla war against Napoleon's rule in Spain.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie appears to mock the widespread belief in ghostly apparitions in this story. Niels's amusing response--that a headless horse had stuck its head in through the window--at once confirms and undermines the belief. 

     Tang Kristensen made a slight change to the wording of the story, so that the reference to the headless horse came first. In this manner, the story became primarily a story about the headless horse, rather than a story about Niels B&#xF8;dker's amusing response to the doubters. Kirsten Marie told another variant of the story in her second session with Tang Kristensen (KMP 2.14).</annotation>

    <annotation>The ghostly apparition of land surveyors is widely attested (DS V 1417, 1422). During the land reforms of the late eighteenth century, and with the partitioning of farms and the recovery of heath through the nineteenth century, land surveyors were kept busy. Numerous legends tell of corrupt land surveyors who did not draw proper boundary lines or otherwise engaged in dishonest surveying, often at the instigation of a party to the survey (DS V 1443, 1484). Such dishonesty was often repaid in the afterlife when the land surveyor was forced to haunt (DS V 1477, 1507). Pentika&#xEF;nen classifies such haunts as guilty haunts (1969). In this story, as in the story of the black dog, neither the young boy nor the grandmother make any contact with the haunts, and the haunts simply disappear.

     The distance from Halling to Nielstrup, following roads, is approximately 6.2 kilometers.</annotation>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen included well over fifty variants of this legend in his published collections of Danske sagn (DS III 880, 898). Str&#xF6;mb&#xE4;ck in his study of the tale identifies three subtypes (1958). The destruction of the church at night may be linked to the mound dwellers. Other typical church destroyers are trolls and giants. The use of oxen to determine the building site (in some variants, the oxen are tied to the building materials) relies on several inversions of the normal order. The infertility of the oxen stands in contrast to the communal elements of the church. Also, allowing oxen to roam free and, in other variants, at night, runs counter to normal roles for domesticated animals: their grazing is usually limited to specific fields and they are not used productively at night. 

     In some variants, such as this one, the oxen are forced to pull some of the building materials for the church, whereas in other variants, the animals are simply hitched together (DS III 898). Kirsten Marie tells another version of this story in a later session (KMP 3.10). Ane Margrete Jensdatter also told a variant of this story (AMJ 3.05).</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie's story is a variant of a well known legend about tricking the mound dwellers (PJ 2.03; DS I 774). It is related to stories of the mound dwellers baking and people being kidnapped by the mound dwellers (DS I 381, 382, 832). The dance of the mound dwellers stands as a supernatural temptation, as does the seemingly seductive offer of the drink. 

     The farmhand is out at night--a liminal time--and far from the protection of the "inside" of the farm. He recognizes the threat, however, and throws the drink over his shoulder. While he escapes unscathed, the horse is injured, a recognition of just how close he has come to a bad end. His smart thinking of riding across the plowed fields, and thus inscribing a cross on the ground making it impossible for the non-Christian mound woman to pursue him, would otherwise be considered transgressive (PJ 2.03). In many stories, one finds that the best strategy for dealing with outside threat is to do something that would otherwise be considered anti-social, such as riding across freshly plowed fields. 

      The use of the drinking horn to support the building of a church or the use of the vessel as a chalice is a common resolution to these stories (DS I 807, 813). In those variants where the person keeps the horn for their own personal gain, the mound dwellers often return to reclaim it (DS I 796). The use of the wealth of the mound dwellers to support the community, on the other hand, is narratively lauded.

     The story ends with a series of etiological tags that explain the names of local places. The etiology of the mound name, "Turning Mound," is more elaborate in the published version than in the original version.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is a variant of the widely attested legends about the mound dwellers' baking, critically explored in a substantive monograph by Boberg (1938). Boberg links the mound dweller's request to the concept of the gift, an economic concept taken up by Mauss (1954). The transaction described in this legend is not, however, a gift. Rather, it is more closely related to out group barter transactions (Tangherlini 1998). Despite the penetration of a monetized economy into most aspects of Danish life in the late nineteenth century, a great deal of economic activity still relied on barter (Hvidt and Olsen 1990). The rules governing such transactions are often hard to discern, and there is often a nagging question as to whether a barter deal was "fair." 

     In many variants, the farmhand is hesitant to eat the food proffered in return for his services, since food prepared by outsiders (in this case, presumably supernatural outsiders) can be dangerous. Accordingly, different variants explore the different strategies--and outcomes of those strategies--for dealing with the interaction (BJK 4.22; JPP 4.04). In this case, the farmhand eats the cake with the end result that things go well for him. Here, Kirsten Marie endorses the concept of out group barter transaction. Such an attitude eschews the zero-sum notion of "limited good" that Foster examined in the context of peasant societies (Foster 1965). Instead, Kirsten Marie proposes that the economic pie can and should be expanded. This stance aligns well with her own social position, since the farm owning class was eager to expand opportunities for economic activity beyond the local market town.</annotation>

When he was down at the other end of the field, an oven rake came up out of the mound and it was in pieces. So he fixes it. At noontime, he drove home to Voldum and, in the afternoon, he went back out there. Then there was a cake lying there at the place where the [oven] rake had lain.

    <annotation>Up through the mid nineteenth century, it was common practice among farmers to let their animals graze on all the newly harvested fields, irrespective of field boundaries, the upcoming crop, and the position of the field in the rotation (Bj&#xF8;rn 1988 vol. 3). Even though the practice was banned because of the significant damage that the animals did to the fields, the ban was hard to enforce. As the parceling of fields was completed, more substantial fences and walls were erected, and more consistent techniques in fertilizing, drainage, and crop rotation were implemented. Ultimately, the practice of uncontrolled grazing was abandoned.

     The story plays on the stereotype of the foolish Molbo. Tang Kristensen published several volumes of these stories, inspired in part by Tuxen's earlier collection of similar stories (1866). 

     In this and the following story, Tang Kristensen tried to capture Kirsten Marie's use of dialect. Hajjbj&#xF6;re is a dialect pronunciation of Hadbjerg, a location that strictly speaking does not geographically qualify as Mols. Instead, it is the foolish actions of the protagonist that prompt Tang Kristensen to classify the story as a Molbo tale.</annotation>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen often made notations about Jutlandic dialect during performances. These likely were made in the lull between stories or perhaps when some other interruption caused a break in the flow of the recording session. These notations became important source material for Henning Feilberg when he compiled his dictionary of Jutlandic dialects, and for Jeppe Aakj&#xE6;r when he began to write stories and plays using these dialects. Tang Kristensen made contrastive comments, comparing pronunciations from one locality with those of a nearby community. The distance between Rud and Hornslet is approximately twelve kilometers and so the difference in pronunciation over such a short distance is quite striking.</annotation>

    <annotation>Despite commerce laws that restricted most craftsmen to market towns, tailors could seek dispensation to work outside the market towns. The chance encounter with the tailor out on the field is not unusual. The person from Mols, or "Molbo", is of higher social status than the wandering tailor, and so the trick the tailor plays on him may in part reflect the tension that existed between the poor, wandering craftsmen and the more stable cotters and farmers. Kirsten Marie's story focuses not so much on the trickiness of the tailor, but the foolishness of the Molbo farmer. A "Molbo historie" is a common Danish term for a numbskull tale or jocular tale.</annotation>

    <annotation>In this story of a violent conflict between two warring groups of vagabonds, the farmhand acts as a witness from the higher echelons of rural society. His account offers a small window into the otherwise hidden world of the itinerant population of natmandsfolk (refuse collectors; nightmen).

      The distinction that Kirsten Marie draws between the rakker (knacker) and the gjelder (gelder) is a subtle one. Christian II's law for towns required that every market town should have a knacker (rakker) and an executioner (b&#xF8;ddel). Over the years, the distinction between the executioner and the knacker became more distinct, with the executioner only having responsibility for executions and the knacker having a broader series of responsibilities, including the burial of suicides and the hung, flaying of animals that died (instead of being slaughtered), cleaning sewers and the like. 

      Subsequently, the term rakker (knacker) became a common appellation in the eastern and southern parts of Vendsyssel (northern Jutland) for people engaged in all the jobs considered "dirty," such as flaying, chimney sweeping and the gelding of animals (Gaardboe 1968, 18). In northern Vendsyssel, the common appelation was "natfolk" or "natmandsfolk," because the jobs they did were ostensibly carried out at night under the cover of darkness, or were otherwise hidden from view: the cleaning of latrines, the burial of suicides, and the like. 

      Both the knacker and the gelder were members of the lowest social class, albeit above the class of unemployed or unemployable poor. They were often buried in the least desirable part of the cemetery, namely the northern end.

     The various laws concerning begging and poverty assistance did little for this class of itinerant workers. At the same time, they ignored laws concerning commerce that would bar them from selling knick-knacks or working as craftsmen at the farms they visited. 

     Natmandsfolk were ethnically Danish, in contrast to other itinerant groups, referred to as tatere (gypsies), a term used for foreign wanderers irrespective of their heritage, or glarmesterfolk (glaziers), who were often not of Danish heritage (Gaarboe 1968, 12-13). 

     A significant amount of scholarship has focused on the life and hard times of the various itinerant populations in Denmark in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Perhaps one of the best known and earliest of these studies was Me&#xEF;r Goldschmidt's study of wanderers and outsiders in Denmark (1867). Dyrlund's study of gypsies and other itinerants is considered to be the first significant historical study of this phenomenon (1872). Earlier, Sundt undertook a similar study in Norway (1850). While a small number of these people were gypsies, the vast majority were ethnic Danes who for various reasons had dropped out of society and had become vagabonds.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>In Hvall&#xF8;s there lived a knacker and a gelder. The knacker and his wife didn't have any children, but the gelder had two, a daughter and a son. There was a farmhand who worked there in town at his paternal aunt's. The knacker and the gelder didn't get along, because the gelder wanted to be considered honest and the knacker always called them dishonest. He was allowed to go to the altar, but he had to drink from the bottom of the chalice, and when he was out working with other people, he had to sit at the end of the table and eat. Now this farmhand always wanted to go over to the gelder's place because there was always something going on. One evening, he was over there, and the knacker and the gelder's people had both been in Randers, and they told about how they'd had a fight with the knacker, and he was lying in Hvolb&#xE6;k and he'd been hit like this and like that, so he couldn't even walk. The gelder's people sat and amused themselves with this. But just as they were sitting there like this, the knacker threw open the door and yelled, "Get out of here you devils!" And then they jumped up and each one grabbed a long knife, and there was a huge murderous fight in there and the lights were extinguished and the farmhand didn't know what to do other than to grab the table and hold it over himself, and he sat in a corner with it until the row had ended. Then he got up and sat down at the table, and when they lit the lights, he was sitting at the table again. Then he quickly said goodnight and got out of there as soon as he could. His paternal aunt never liked that he went over there, and he didn't go there after that.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>As in the previous story, Kirsten Marie provides a slightly higher class witness to yet another violent episode in the life of a knacker. The coachman's perch in the barn loft is reminiscent of stories in which a farmhand or coachman witnesses the minister fighting with Satan (DS V 728, 730). The knacker is characterized as dishonest even though the story does little to support this. Incompetent, perhaps, but not dishonest. The notion of the knacker as dishonest likely derives from the general distrust of vagabonds and beggars that was ubiquitous among the higher status rural populations of the time. The pervasive belief in the dishonesty of the very poor fed the resistance of farm owners and even some cotters to the proposed reforms of the welfare system.</annotation>

    <annotation>In this story, Kirsten Marie pits a tailor against a group of aggressive, foul-mouthed gypsies. The tailor's challenge to the gypsies--asking where they are from--has an implicit legal component. If they were not from the local area (and the tailor most likely knew this), then they were not allowed to ask for alms in the community. Their reaction is amusing, and allows Kirsten Marie to swear numerous oaths without any of the approbation that would otherwise follow using such colorful language. The housewife comes across as the strongest figure in the story, using her mangle roller to chase off the potentially threatening--and clearly dishonest--outsiders.</annotation>

While the wife was off getting it, the tailor says to them, "Where do you two come from?" - "What's that?" they say. "I said, where do you go to church, where are you from?" - "What are you saying?" they say. "Let the red cock crow over you one day, little one (f&#xE5;esen)!

At the same time, the farmwife comes in and she says, "What is that supposed to mean? On my blessed oath I want you out of here!" and she goes over and grabs a mangle roller, which was on a chest in the room, and she begins to beat them with it. Then they started shouting at her, but then they went out and lay down by the garden wall and smoked tobacco, puffing away so that the smoke was thick about them. Then the farmwife takes the mangle roller again and goes out and smacked them with it again and drives them farther away. Women weren't too bad at that in those days, they could always use the mangle roller.

    <annotation>The vagabond's refusal of the alms offered by the farmwife is rightfully taken as an affront to her generosity. The sense that the poor were not sufficiently thankful for the alms they were offered resonates with the ongoing debates in the nineteenth century over the structure and parameters of assistance to the poor. Kirsten Marie's stories align with the general resistance to reforms that placed a significant burden for the care of the poor on farm owners. The sense that the poor did not appreciate the alms would accordingly help allay any guilt that might accrue for not wanting to help.</annotation>

    <annotation>In this story, the low status person turns the tables on the manor lords, and ultimately becomes a large land holder himself. The story seemingly contradicts Kirsten Marie's previous stories, since the low status entertainer is narratively lauded, while the land holders are shown to be quite stupid. At the same time, her story seemingly supports the general sense that lower status people are untrustworthy. 

      There are two important reversals that animate this story. First, the victims of the scam are large land holders. Consequently, the narrative is not directed at Kirsten Marie's cohort, but rather at a class with whom the farmers often fought and who, during the years after the initial constitutional reforms of 1848, showed themselves time and again not to be on the side of the small farmer. Presumably, the new manor lord at &#xC6;bletoft, because of his modest beginnings, would have much more in common with the local farmers. Second, the man uses the legal system that had formerly been firmly in the hands of the manor lords in the form of the birk (judicial districts) to defeat them. Accordingly, the story explores the penetration of litigation into all levels of rural culture.

    <annotation>This brief bit of folk speech seems to interrupt Kirsten Marie's storytelling. It might well have come after an interruption of one sort or another, since the next story continues in the vein of stories about wanderers, mendicants and gypsies. It seems unlikely that this marks the end of the first day of collecting (Tang Kristensen's first visit with Kirsten Marie broke over two days). Tang Kristensen never published this short saying, and it is unclear what exactly it means, as the word kokkene can be interpreted as cooks, roosters or penises.

    <annotation>Vagabonds, beggars and itinerant laborers were known by nicknames as were the cunning folk. Kirsten Marie brings the world of these itinerants into her immediate sphere, by situating the peddler's house next to her father's house. The belief that a coin in the pocket would bring success in trade that day is a form of sympathetic magic, in which "like produces like." Here, the money in the pocket would attract more money.</annotation>

    <annotation>"Gypsies" (tattere) was a catch-all term for vagabonds who were of non-Danish ethnic heritage. While there were a number of gypsies living in Denmark in the nineteenth century, the population was small. This story relies, as many of Kirsten Marie's stories do, on the clear distinction between rural social classes. The miller was an important community figure, often owned considerable land himself, and would be counted among the most important members of a parish (see discussion of millers in chapter on Peder Johansen). Inheriting a mill would have guaranteed the young woman a steady income and a comfortable existence as opposed to the harrowing experiences that awaited her as the wife of a vagabond. 

      The gypsy brings the marital discord--a representation of the hard life Gertrude has chosen for herself--right to Kirsten Marie's father's doorstep, while her great grandmother cries for the girl's tragic choice of poverty over security and relative wealth.</annotation>

    <annotation>Tang Kristensen collected numerous folk remedies for common maladies. Many of these remedies were ones that people had learned from local cunning folk, others were ones that they had learned from family members, friends or coworkers. This particular remedy relies in part on the magical power of the church and Christian prayer. Through the nineteenth century, many of the cunning folk were evangelical Christians engaged in faith healing (R&#xF8;rbye 1976). The remedy also relies on sympathetic magic, where like produces like. Here, the diminishing numbers produce a similar diminishing effect for the warts.

     The six remedies and spells that Kirsten Marie told may mark another break in the performance.</annotation>

    <annotation>The cure for sprain is similar to her cure for warts and venom (KMP 1.36). All of these cures rely on Christian prayer, and the laying on of hands. Rubbing a sprain might actually help in reducing swelling, but the efficacy of this cure is more tied to the recitation of the prayer and the laying on of hands. The short rhyme is a common feature of cures for sprains.

     Fractures and sprains were a common occurrence on farms given the nature of the work. Although physicians had become an important part of the health care system by the late nineteenth century, sprains and breaks were often taken care of by "benbrudsl&#xE6;ger," or broken bone doctors. These people were not physicians, but rather local folk healers who had developed a specialization in setting broken bones. A special concession from September 5, 1794, allowed individuals who had developed this, or any other expertise in healing, to practice that specialty. Most applications for this type of waiver from the quacksalver laws were denied. The majority of accepted applications were for bone break specialists. The last permission for a bone specialist was issued in 1887. The law was finally repealed with the passage of the physician law of 1934 (R&#xF8;rbye 1976, 279-80).</annotation>

    <annotation>This cure relies on a form of prayer and is similar to Kirsten Marie's cure for a sprain (KMP 1.35). Jesus's encounter with the poisoned stag is synonymous with the patient's own poisoning. The cure imitates the story that constitutes the cure. As with many of Kirsten Marie's cures, the spoken phrase(s) and prayer are repeated three times.

     The stag is commonly attributed supernatural powers in north Germanic folklore (B&#xE4;chtold-Staubli and Hoffman-Krayer 1987). Frequently, the hart is related to supernatural nature beings and, in some stories, it attempts to lure a person into the woods. In fairy tales and ballads, the stag occasionally appears with a cross between his antlers (DgF 113) or other magical token (DgF 40). The magical stag is also known from medieval literature, including G&#xF6;ngu-Hr&#xF3;lfs saga, and Gesta Romanorum.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie offers both a remedy and a story that confirms the efficacy of the remedy. Interestingly, it is a parish clerk who consults a cunning person for the remedy. In many Danish legends, a parallel is drawn between cunning folk and parish clerks, in large part because of their subordinate relationship to parish ministers (Tangherlini 1998).

     In Danish folk belief, the mare is a woman who rides on a person's chest while he is asleep (Tillhagen 1960 and 1981; Raudvere 1993). Victims of the mare are predominantly male. The person who is plagued by a mare wakes up exhausted, and may eventually die (PJ 3.04).

     There are numerous remedies and spells for keeping a mare away from houses and also from animals (Raudvere 1993). In contrast to remedies for the mare, Kirsten Marie's remedy seems to be related either to birthing, given the fact that those spells often rely on sympathetic magic, or to modsot, an unspecified wasting disease. Cures for modsot often included measuring the patient (DS VII 1612).Tang Kristensen clearly believed the spell was related to this last category given his placement of the story in Danske sagn in a section with other cures for modsot and similar wasting diseases.

     The distance from Rud to Stubdrup is approximately one kilometer. In the published variant, Tang Kristensen made a transcription error and located the parish clerk in Rude, rather than in Rud, many kilometers to the south. Borup is approximately twenty-two kilometers north of Rud and just north of Randers.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie draws on her own experience in her youth herding animals for this next spell. The stampeding of a cow across plowed fields could be catastrophic because of the damage to the fields, the potential harm to the cow, and the danger a stampeding cow poses for anyone in its way. The notion that spells can also do harm is widespread. The spell implicitly refers to the grave economic threat that unexpected and sudden events posed to farms and farmers.</annotation>

    <annotation>Unlike most of Kirsten Marie's other spells, this spell makes no reference to prayer or Christian belief. Kirsten Marie also offers a short narrative to confirm the efficacy of the spell. Other spells make oblique references to religious figures (DS VI 973).

     Bees were often kept as a means to supplement income and to provide honey which could be used in brewing.

     A bee swarm is of course a threatening thing, both to humans and to animals, although it is unlikely that swarming honey bees would actually attack anyone. Nevertheless, animals might well be spooked by, and stampede at, the sight and sounds of a bee swarm. 

     A bee swarm usually indicates overcrowding in the hive and the queen bee often leaves the hive during a swarm. Consequently, a swarm might reduce honey production, and it would be important to any beekeeper to quell the swarm quickly and effectively. The swarm might also choose to move to another hive not on the beekeeper's property. Putting the swarm into a stone heap might be a temporary solution, but it would do little to help with honey production at the farm.

     Tang Kristensen noted that the word toend&#xE9;, written as one word in the manuscript, but as three words in the published version, is incomprehensible. Feilberg's explanation of the word toende, "sweat profusely," makes little sense in this context (Feilberg 1977 vol. 4, 815). It is more likely that Kirsten Marie did not remember, or perhaps never knew, the words that finished her mother's spell.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie's performance of folk cures leads to a legend about a cunning person, in this case the well-known Vindbl&#xE6;skone, also known as Maren Haaning (R&#xF8;rbye 1976, 104-9). 

     R&#xF8;rbye points out that Vindbl&#xE6;skonen was essentially a company name for all the cunning folk who were descendants of Maren Kirstine Christensdatter Haaning (1782-1853) (R&#xF8;rbye 1976, 104). This family became the most famous family of cunning folk in Denmark. There are numerous stories related to their practice in Danske sagn (DS VI 882, 886).

    Up through the nineteenth century, there was considerable competition among cunning folk. Because of strict laws against quacksalvery and practicing medicine without a license, cunning folk often relied on word of mouth to support their practices. Despite the laws, authorities often "looked the other way" at these practices since the cunning folk represented, in many cases, the only access to health care for many people living in rural areas. Indeed, the Haaning family had a close working relationship with the pharmacy in L&#xF8;gst&#xF8;r (R&#xF8;rbye 1976, 105). 

     Stories such as this attest to the considerable discussion among the rural population not only of whether the cunning folk could help but also about which cunning folk were worth visiting. In this story, and the following story, the cunning woman's cures are shown to be ineffective.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie confirms the popularity of the Vindbl&#xE6;skone, whose main customer base was in northern and western Jutland (R&#xF8;rbye 1976, 105). Despite numerous complaints against them, the Vinbl&#xE6;sfolk (Vinbl&#xE6;s people) were never subjected to anything more than fines for quacksalvery because their patients vouched for them, and the local physicians had agreed to leave them in peace (R&#xF8;rbye 1976, 106).

     Even though the son in this story dies, the Vindbl&#xE6;s woman's powers are confirmed through her accurate prediction of the baker's death. Although the ability to predict accurately someone's death might have led to accusations of witchcraft in an earlier time, historical changes and, perhaps more importantly, the Vindbl&#xE6;s woman's considerable status in the surrounding area, would have allowed her to easily beat any such accusation (Tangherlini 2000).</annotation>

    <annotation>Calling on her own experiences as a shepherd, Kirsten Marie recounts her impressions of the landscape, and the possibility of reading an earlier history inscribed in that landscape. Tuesg&#xE5;rd may have been a farm that was abandoned during the eighteenth century, and placed under the control of a larger manor farm (See BJK 1.32 and 3.48). 

     Kirsten Marie alludes here to the land reforms of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. There is little evidence that people moved back into villages and then back out onto the fields. On the other hand, rampant parceling of farmland into smaller and smaller plots resulted in cotter holdings that were so small that they could not support a family and subsequently contributed to the ongoing problem of rural poverty that was a main political and social concern up through the end of the nineteenth century.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie's worries about vagabonds find clear expression in this story. In the preceding story (1.43), she painted a picture of villages being overrun by wanderers, a position that was argued in the st&#xE6;nderforsamlinger (local assemblies) and later in the parliament by Jutlandic representatives in response to various proposals for laws concerning poverty assistance. In this case, the farm itself is overrun by wanderers who not only overwhelm the farm, but also bring disease with them.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie's personal account of saving the frog from the snake brings the realm of the cunning person into her personal realm. The Swede is an outsider and therefore may be linked to the supernatural although in most of these stories, the magical outsider is a Finn. The Swede alludes, as Kirsten Marie does in many of her spells, to sympathetic magic with the frog's release by the snake likened to the birthing process. Other beliefs mention grass snakes using toads to hatch their eggs (DS II E 136), and yet other stories connect these snakes to the viper king (DS II E 144). Interfering with snakes is generally considered to be dangerous (DS II E 142).</annotation>

    <annotation>This fictional and somewhat amusing account of the antics of the Lord and Saint Peter shares several features with ATU 461 tales, "Three Hairs from the Devil's Beard", but is much closer to ATU 779a tales, "Miscellaneous Divine Rewards and Punishments". It is interesting to note that an itinerant peddler, known by the nickname "Ridesvends kr&#xE6;mmer," figures in this tale, given the numerous stories that Kirsten Marie tells about these untrustworthy wanderers. 

     The word "gilde" (feast) only makes sense in this story if it is taken to mean wedding celebration. Presumably the peddler has a daughter, and the boy is married to her. When the peddler commits suicide, the boy, now his son-in-law, inherits from him. According to Danish inheritance law, the son-in-law would, by marriage, be entitled to the inheritance from his wife's father, as long as they remained married.

     The story was never published in any of Tang Kristensen's collections.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>It was at the time when Our Lord and St. Peter walked the earth, they came in and asked for lodgings at a place and wanted to rest there. The Ridesvends kr&#xE6;mmer (the outriders' peddler) had also gotten a place to sleep there, but they didn't know about each other, so to speak, and they lay there in each their own bed. Then they heard that the wife there was in labor. Then Our Lord said to St. Peter, go out and see which stars are in the sky now that the child is to be born. He came in and said that the child would be hung. Yes, well then he shouldn't be born yet. Then he asked him a little later to go out. Said he would be burned. Not born yet either. Go out again. He said he would inherit the Ridesvends peddler. Well then he could be born. Then the Ridesvends peddler in the other bed thought that that would be quite a lie, was going to make sure that it wouldn't happen. Went off. When the child got bigger, he got hold of him and he was to be with him. He was a peddler and he followed along with him. One day he wrote a letter and sent him home with it and they should kill him. Along the way, he came past a cemetery, lay down there and slept and put the letter under his head. Then they came out of the church, and the minister went over and saw what was written in the letter. He wrote another letter, that they should try to have a wedding celebration as quickly as possible, and he put it quietly back into the envelope. They had the celebration and everything was done and ready when he got home. The outriders' peddler killed himself and then he inherited from him.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>I den Tid, da Vorherre og Sant-Peder de gik paa Jorden, da kom de en Aften til et Sted og bad om Hus.

Han var nu allerede gaaet ti Ro, og saa kom Vorherre og Sant-Peder ogsaa til Ro, men de laa da hver i sin Seng. Lidt efter h&#xF8;rte de, te Konen i Huset hun kom i Barnsn&#xF8;d. Saa siger Vorherre og til Sant-Peder: &#x201D;Gaa ud og se, hvad Stj&#xE6;rner der er paa Himmelen.&#x201D; Han gik og kom ind igjen og fortalte det. &#x201D;Ja, saa kan det ikke gaa an at lade Barnet blive f&#xF8;dt endnu, for hvis det nu blev f&#xF8;dt, saa skulde det h&#xE6;nges.&#x201D; Konen hun laa nu og klagede sig der inde, og saa et Stykke Tid efter siger Vorherre igjen til Sant-Peder, at han skal gaa ud og se efter, hvad Stj&#xE6;rner der er nu paa Himmelen. Han kommer tilbage og fort&#xE6;ller det. &#x201D;Nej, saa kan det ikke gaa an endnu, for hvis Barnet nu blev f&#xF8;dt, saa skuld det br&#xE6;ndes.&#x201D; Der gaar igjen en Tid og Konen ligger og klager sig jammerlig. &#x201D;Nu kan du gaa ud og se igjen.&#x201D; Han gaar og kommer tilbage og fort&#xE6;ller, hvad han har set. &#x201D;Ja, nu kan det gaa,&#x201D; siger Vorherre, &#x201D;for naar det nu bliver f&#xF8;dt, saa skal den komme til at arve Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmer.&#x201D; Saa maatte Drengen altsaa blive f&#xF8;dt, og han blev det ogsaa. Nu laa Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmer jo i den anden Seng, og han laa og h&#xF8;rte det. Saa t&#xE6;nkte han: &#x201D;Det skal blive en farlig L&#xF8;gn, det skal a nok se at faa forb&#xF8;jen.&#x201D; Om Morgenen rejste han derfra igjen, og Vorherre og Sant-Peder gjorde ogsaa. Barnet vokste godt til og blev en dygtig Dreng. Nu havde Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmer jo hans Opm&#xE6;rksomhed henvendt paa den Dreng, og saa kommer han en Gang tilbage dertil og forlanger at faa den Dreng. Han foregav, han skulde f&#xF8;lge med ham ud at handle og da faa det saa og saa godt. Han fortalte jo, han var Kr&#xE6;mmer, og For&#xE6;ldrene tykte godt om hans Forslag og lod ham faa Drengen. Der gik nogle Dage hen, og Drengen havde det godt nok. Men saa skriver Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmer en Dag et Brev, og det skulde han gaa hjem til hans Kone og Datter med, og han gav ham jo Besked om Vejen. I det Brev stod der, at naar Overbringeren af det Brev kom, saa skulde de slaa ham ihjel, og det skulde gj&#xF8;res saa betids, at han kunde v&#xE6;re henne, inden Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmer kom hjem. Han gaar saa med Brevet, det gj&#xF8;r Drengen, men det var en lang Vej, og han blev tr&#xE6;t. Saa kom han forbi en Kirkegaard, og der kom han i Tanker om at gaa ind og l&#xE6;gge sig lidt for at hvile, og han lagde Brevet under hans Hoved. Men nu var han jo saa tr&#xE6;t, og da han saadan ligger, falder han i S&#xF8;vn. Nu var det netop en S&#xF8;ndag, og der var Tjeneste i Kirken. Den Gang Folkene kom ud, var der nogle, der saa den Dreng, og de gaar hen og fort&#xE6;ller Pr&#xE6;sten det. Han kommer saa hen til ham og ser paa ham, og saa faar han ogsaa det Brev at se, der ligger under hans Hoved. Han lister sig til at faa fat i det og br&#xE6;kker det og l&#xE6;ser, hvad der staar. Da f&#xF8;ler han jo Medynk med den kj&#xF8;nne Dreng og gaar ind og skriver Brevet om, saa der kommer til at staa, at de skulde give Overbringeren af Brevet Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmers Datter snarest mulig, og de skulde str&#xE6;be saadan med at have Gilde, at det hele kunde v&#xE6;re til Side, inden han selv kommer hjem. Han stak nu saa lettelig Brevet ind under Drengens Hoved igjen, og saa gik de hver til sit. Naa, Drengen vaagnede omsider, og saa kom han afsted igjen, og kom endelig hjem til Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmers Hus og gav hans Kone Brevet. Hun l&#xE6;ste, hvad der stod, og fik nu travlt med at faa det ordnet. Men de fik da Gilde og alting var klappet og klart, da Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmer kom hjem. Han blev jo saa flyvegal, da han h&#xF8;rte, hvad der var gaaet for sig. Men Konen viste ham jo Brevet, og saa kunde han jo selv se, hvad han havde skrevet saa hun havde ingen Skyld i det. Han blev nu saa &#xE6;rgerlig, at han gik hen og tog sig selv af med Livet, og saa arvede Drengen jo det hele, der var ingen n&#xE6;rere til det, og saadan gik det i Opfyldelse, hvad Vorherre havde sagt.

Navnet blev indtalt: Riisvends Kr&#xE6;mer. Sandsynligvis er det oprindelige Ribersvends Kr&#xE6;mmer.

    <english_publication>At the time when Our Lord and Saint Peter walked on Earth, they came one evening to a place and asked for lodgings. They were given permission to stay there, but a short time earlier the Ridesvends Kr&#xE6;mmer (The Outrider&#xB4;s Peddler) had also arrived there and had asked for lodgings, and they had also given him quarter. He had already gone to bed, and then Our Lord and Saint Peter also went to bed, but they lay each in their own bed. A little later they heard that the woman of the house had gone into labor. Then Our Lord says to Saint Peter: &#x201C;Go out and see which stars are in the heavens.&#x201D; He went out and came back in again and told him. &#x201C;Well, then we can&#x2019;t let the child be born yet, because if it is born now, then it will be hung.&#x201D; So the woman lies complaining in there some more, and then a little bit later, Our Lord once again tells Saint Peter to go out and see which stars are in the heavens. He comes back and tells him. &#x201C;No, it still isn&#x2019;t right, because if the child was born now, then it would be burned.&#x201D; A little time goes by again, and the woman is still lying in there complaining horribly. &#x201C;Now you can go out and look again.&#x201D; He comes back and tells him what he has seen. &#x201C;Yes, now it is OK,&#x201D; says Our Lord, &#x201C;because when the child is born now, then he will inherit from the Outrider&#x2019;s Peddler. Then the boy could be born, and he was. Now the Outrider&#x2019;s Peddler lay in the other bed, and he lay there and listened to this. Then he thought to himself: &#x201C;That will be one heck of a lie, I&#x2019;ll make sure of that.&#x201D; The next morning, he left again, and Our Lord and Saint Peter did too. The child grew up well and became a clever lad. Now the Outrider&#x2019;s Peddler had focused his attention on the boy, and so one time he comes back to that place and asks to have the boy. He told them that he was a peddler, and the parents liked his proposal and they let him have the boy. A couple of days passed, and the boy was doing fine. But then one day the Outrider&#x2019;s Peddler writes a letter, and the boy was to take it home to the peddler's wife and daughter, and he told him how to get there. It was written in the letter that when the bearer of the letter arrived they were to kill him, and it should be done so quickly that he would be dead before the Outrider&#x2019;s Peddler came home. So he walks off with the letter, the boy does, but it was a long way, and he gets tired. So he walks past a cemetery, and he decided to go in and lie down a bit to take a rest, and he put the letter under his head. But he was so tired that when he lay down like that, he fell asleep. Now it turned out that it was a Sunday, and there were services in the church. When the people came out, there were some who saw the boy, and they go off and tell the minister that. He comes over to him, and then he also notices the letter which is under his head. Stealthily, he gets a hold of it and opens it and reads what it says. Now he feels a great deal of sympathy for the beautiful boy and goes inside and rewrites the letter so that it says that they should give the bearer of the letter the Outrider Peddler&#x2019;s daughter as his bride as soon as possible, and exert themselves to have a wedding banquet so that it can all be done by the time he comes home. He now carefully put the letter back under the boy&#x2019;s head again, and then they all left. Well, the boy woke up after a while, and then he set off again, and finally he gets to the Outrider Peddler&#x2019;s house and gave the peddler&#x2019;s wife the letter. She read what it said, and now got busy arranging everything. They had the wedding banquet and had everything done free and clear by the time the Outrider&#x2019;s Peddler came home. He became so crazed with anger when he heard what had happened. But his wife showed him the letter, and he could see for himself what he had written, she had no fault in this. He became so aggravated that he went and killed himself, and then the boy inherited all of it, there were no closer relatives, and that&#x2019;s how what Our Lord had said was fulfilled.

The name was recorded as: Riisvends Kr&#xE6;mer. It is most likely that it was originally Ribersvends Kr&#xE6;mmer.</english_publication>

    <annotation>As with most fairy tales, this one is set in an unspecified time and place. The sultan's dalliance with the grocer's daughter leads to a confusion of social rank and status for the ensuing boy child, and this confusion animates the rest of the tale. The boy's dalliance with the viceroy's daughter is the inverse of his father's earlier peccadillo. He relies on his father's token to save his life, and to assume his rightful place in the social hierarchy. Presumably, he will also inherit from the sultan.

     Kirsten Marie is keenly aware of class differences in her storytelling. Holbek suggests that fairy tales in Denmark are not so much about kings and queens, but more about the nuanced distinction between the very poor, the poor and the moderately well off, such as farm owners (Holbek 1987). In other stories, it is exactly this tension between these various economic and social classes that informs Kirsten Marie's storytelling. Here, the dialectic is incorporated into a fictional tale; the class differences--and the punishments--are more extreme than in her legends, but the folktale has a generic tendency toward extremes (Holbek 1987).

     Tang Kristensen rightfully classifies this tale as a fairy tale. Although it has many similarities with ATU 873, "The King Discovers His Unknown Son", it diverges quite substantially from the tale's general outline in the ATU index. The sultan does not marry the boy's mother, but instead the boy is allowed to marry the viceroy's daughter and, subsequent to the viceroy's execution, inherits the title and, presumably, half the kingdom. The male succession in this tale parallels that of the preceding tale.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Once upon a time when the Sultan was out traveling, he came to a grocer and he got lodgings there for the night. He (the grocer) had but one daughter. She got pregnant and then the Sultan gave her something that she was to tie around the child while it was being born and when it was in danger, it was to show it, and then no one would do anything to them. When the boy had gotten bigger and had started going to school, he came home one day and says to his mother, Mother, they call me a bastard. That you are, my boy, she says. Don't you know where my father is. No, she didn't know. Yes, well then he wanted to go out and look for his father. Then he traveled off and got work with a p&#xE2;t&#xE9; baker and he was to deliver p&#xE2;t&#xE9; to the viceroy. Then this boy always had to go up there with the p&#xE2;t&#xE9;. The king had a daughter and she develops a soft spot for the boy. The baker had now taken him in as their own. The Sultan was traveling about at that time and was disguised and he came there to the viceroy and asked him if he didn't want to have a look around and be disguised. They went out together and went and listened to and asked about one thing and the other. Then the Sultan noticed that this young man had a soft spot for the daughter. So they were (disguised as) pilgrims and came to the baker's and asked for lodgings. They said they were welcome to stay there, in the young man's room, as long as it was OK with him. After they'd lain in bed for a while, the daughter came in to him. The king recognized his daughter and the Sultan kept poking him in his side, he was to lay still and keep his mouth shut. Then they left the next morning and the King was so mad at the young man, but the Sultan asked him not to forbid them from seeing each other. The Sultan journeyed off and the king was to be in charge of everything while he was gone. There was a bridge the young man had to cross when he was to come with the p&#xE2;t&#xE9;, and the king put two men there as guards and they were to kill him and come and show him blood on their swords. Then they jumped him and he realized he was going to be killed, he took his mark up and showed them. Then they said to each other that that was the Sultan's own seal, and so no one could touch him. But he had a little dog, so they stabbed that to death and then they showed the king the blood on their swords and showed him that he was dead now. Then he was supposed to hide and he wasn't to come out until the Sultan came home again. When the Sultan came home the guard went to him with the young man's mark. Then he says, What, did you murder him? Yes, we were told to do so by the viceroy, but they hadn't done it. Then he asked them to bring him out immediately and they did that and then he asked the viceroy if he didn't think his son was good enough for his daughter. Then they attached six horses to him and he was dragged to death. Then the two got each other and he became the viceroy.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Sultanen var saa god til at se alting efter, og han rejste meget omkring i hans Rige. Da kommer han en Aften til en rig Kj&#xF8;bmand og loserer hos ham om Natten. Den Kj&#xF8;bmand havde en eneste Datter og ikke andre B&#xF8;rn. Nu gjorde Sultanen sig gode Venner med hende, og det endte da med, at hun blev frugtsommelig. Da han saa rejste, gav han hende en Ting, hun skulde binde paa Barnet, naar det blev f&#xF8;dt, og saa sagde han, at hvis den Dreng nogen Sinde kom i Fare, saa skulde han vise det Tegn frem, saa var der ingen, der turde gj&#xF8;re ham noget. Barnet blev f&#xF8;dt, og det blev en Dreng, og da han blev noget stor, kom han til at gaa i Skole. Saa kom han en Dag hjem og sagde til hans Moder: &#x201D;Moder, de kalder mig en Hore unge.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Det er du saa m&#xE6;nd ogsaa, min Dreng,&#x201D; siger hun. &#x201D;Ved du saa ikke, hvor min Fader er?&#x201D; Nej, det vidste hun ikke. Ja, saa vilde han ud i Verden og lede hans Fader op. Altsaa rejser han, og saa kom han ud og tjene hos en Postejbager, og de kom til at synes saa godt om han, at de tog ham til dem som deres egen. Den Bager skulde levere Postejer til Vicekongen, og saa skulde denher Dreng altid op med dem. Han blev jo saa voksen, og saa havde Vicekongen en Datter, der fattede Godhed for Drengen. Sultanen blev ved at rejse omkring og var altid forkl&#xE6;dt. Saa kommer han til Vicekongen og siger til ham, om han havde ikke Lyst til ogsaa at rejse omkring og se Landet efter, saa skulde de f&#xF8;lges ad, og saa skulde han jo ogsaa v&#xE6;re forkl&#xE6;dt. Det kunde han godt v&#xE6;re med til, og de fulgtes saa ad og h&#xF8;rte ud og spurgte om et og andet. De havde nu kl&#xE6;dt sig ud som Pilegrimmer og saa kom de en Aften til Postejbageren og bad om Hus. Ja, Bageren gav dem den Besked, at han havde en Svend, og hans Kammer kunde de nok komme til at ligge i, hvis de ellers maatte for ham, men andre Plads havde de ikke. De vilde jo gj&#xE6;rne blive der, og Karlen blev kaldt til og gav dem Lov til at ligge inde ved ham. Saa kom deher Pilegrimmer jo i Seng, og da de havde ligget der en Tid, og Karlen t&#xE6;nkte de sov, saa lukkede han op for en Pige, der kom ind til ham, og det var ingen andre en Vicekongens Datter. Faderen kunde jo godt kjende hende og havde ondt ved at holde sig, men Sultanen gav ham det ene Puf i Siden efter det andet, for at betyde ham at han skulde ligge stille og holde hans Mund. Da hun havde v&#xE6;ret der en Tid, gik hun igjen og Vicekongen var jo meget vred paa Karlen, og vilde have snakket alvorlig til ham om Morgenen, men Sultanen bad ham ikke forbyde dem at gaa ved hinanden. Saa skulde Sultanen foretage en l&#xE6;ngere Udenlandsrejse, og mens han var henne, skulde Vicekongen styre det hele. Der var en Bro som Karlen skulde over, hver Gang han skulde op til Slottet med Postejer, og der satte Kongen saa to Karle paa Vagt med den Ordre, at naar han kom, skulde de gribe ham og kv&#xE6;le ham, og til Bevis paa, at de havde udf&#xF8;rt hans Ordre, skulde de komme og vise ham Blod paa deres Sabel. De tog ogsaa fat paa ham, men da han saa m&#xE6;rkede, at de vilde gj&#xF8;re ham ondt og kvale ham, saa tog han hans M&#xE6;rke op og viste dem. De sagde saa til hinanden: &#x201D;Det er Sultanens eget Segl, der er ingen, der maa r&#xF8;re ham.&#x201D; Men saa havde han en bitte Hund med sig, den tog de saa og stak ihjel, og saa viste de Kongen Blodet paa deres Sabel og sagde, at nu var Karlen stukken ihjel. Dermed slog han sig saa til Ro. Men Karlen kunde nok forstaa, at han var n&#xF8;dt til at putte sig, indtil Sultanen kom hjem, for ellers blev det galt baade for ham og Vagten. Da Sultanen saa kom tilbage, gik Vagten op til ham med Karlens M&#xE6;rke. Saa siger han &#x201D;Hvor har I faaet det?&#x201D; Ja, det havde en Karl givet dem, som de skulde myrde. &#x201D;Har I saa myrdet ham?&#x201D; Ja, det var befalet dem af Vicekongen, men de havde dog ikke gjort det. Saa bad han dem hente ham frem straks, for at han kunde se, det var sandt. Det gjorde de ogsaa, og han kunde nu skj&#xF8;nne, at det var hans egen S&#xF8;n. Han sendte saa Bud efter Vicekongen og spurgte ham, om han ikke tykte, hans S&#xF8;n kunde v&#xE6;re hans Datter v&#xE6;rd. Derefter d&#xF8;mte han ham til, at der skulde sp&#xE6;ndes 6 Heste for ham, og saa blev han kj&#xF8;rt ihjel. Derefter holdt Sultanen deres Bryllup, og saa blev hans S&#xF8;n Vicekonge efter den anden.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The sultan was very good about keeping an eye on everything and he traveled quite a bit around his kingdom. One evening he arrives at the house of a wealthy grocer and he lodges with him that night. The grocer had but one daughter and no other children. Now the sultan made himself good friends with her, and it ended up that she got pregnant. When he left, he gave her a thing that she was to bind on the child when it was born, and then he said that if the child ever found itself in danger, then he was to show that badge, and then there was no one who would dare do anything to him. The child was born, and it was a boy, and when he got a little bigger, he went to school. One day he came home and said to his mother: &#x201C;Mother, they call me a whore&#x2019;s child.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, you sort of are, my boy,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you know who my father is?&#x201D; No, she didn&#x2019;t know. Well, then he wanted to go out into the world and look for his father. So he journeys off, and he started working for a p&#xE2;t&#xE9; baker, and the baker's family came to like him so much that they took him in as their own. That baker was to make p&#xE2;t&#xE9; for the viceroy, and this boy was always sent up there with the p&#xE2;t&#xE9;. He grew up, and then the viceroy had a daughter, who felt kindness for the boy. The sultan continued traveling about and was always disguised. Then he comes to the viceroy&#x2019;s place and asks him if he didn&#x2019;t want to journey about as well and inspect the country, they could accompany each other, and then he was to be disguised too. He said he&#x2019;d be happy to go along with that, and so theyaccompanied each other and they listened and asked about this and that. They had disguised themselves as pilgrims, and they came one evening to the p&#xE2;t&#xE9; baker&#x2019;s place and asked for lodgings. Well, the baker said that he had a journeyman, and they could stay in his room if it was OK by him, but they didn&#x2019;t have any other room. They really wanted to stay there, and the young man was asked and he gave them permission to stay in his room with him. Then these pilgrims go to bed, and they had lain there a short while, and the young man thought they were sleeping, and so he opened up for a girl who came to him and it was no other than the viceroy&#x2019;s daughter. Her father could easily recognize her and he had a hard time controlling himself, but the sultan kept poking him in the side, telling him to lie still and stay quiet. After she&#x2019;d been there a while, she left again and the viceroy was very angry at the young man, and he wanted to speak seriously with him about it in the morning, but the sultan asked him not to forbid the two from seeing each other. Then the sultan was to go on a longer journey abroad, and while he was gone, the viceroy was to be in charge of everything. There was a bridge that the young man had to cross each time he was to go up to the castle with p&#xE2;t&#xE9;, and two workers were placed on it with the order that, when he came, they were to grab him and kill him, and as evidence that they had carried out the mission, they were to come and show him the blood on their sword. They grabbed him too, but when he realized that they were going to hurt him and kill him, he took his badge up and showed it to them. They said to each other: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the sultan&#x2019;s own seal, no one can touch him.&#x201D; But they had a little dog along with them, so they took it and stabbed it to death. With that, the viceroy calmed down. But the young man understood that he needed to hide until the sultan came home, because otherwise things would go bad for him and the guards. When the sultan came back, the guards went up to him with the young man&#x2019;s badge. Then he says, &#x201C;Where did you get that?&#x201D; Well, a young man who they were supposed to murder had given it to them. &#x201C;So, did you murder him?&#x201D; Well, the viceroy had ordered them to do it, but they hadn&#x2019;t. Then he asked them to bring the young man to him immediately, so he could make sure that that was true. They did that too, and then he could tell that it was his own son. He sent for the viceroy and asked him if he didn&#x2019;t think that his son was good enough for his daughter. After that, he decreed that the viceroy should be attached to six horses, and then be dragged to death. After that, the sultan held a wedding for them, and then his son became the next viceroy after the other one.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This fairy tale, a variant of ATU 562, "The Spirit in the Blue Light", is the longest of all Kirsten Marie's stories. It follows the model of an active, masculine tale (Holbek 1987, 432-3). The main tension in the tale exists between generations on the low level, namely the tension between the soldier and the old woman who wants not only the genie, but the soldier's death. The lion, who appears as a magical helper figure early on in the tale, reappears at the very end of the tale as the soldier's love interest. 

     The tale departs radically from the progression of moves proposed by Holbek. The soldier is presumably already an adult by the time he encounters the lion, having served as a soldier for thirty years--thus the tale lacks the standard young male protagonist at low level. The obvious donor role played by the lion aligns with Holbek's move two. The old woman the soldier encounters may well be a manifestation of the tension at high level that has changed the princess into a lion. His successful completion of the task confirms his status as an adult; the riches he has won suggest a move to high level, but the riches often precede change in actual status. The interlude with the false princess and the false king is reminiscent of Holbek's move four. Ultimately, he returns for the lion, discovers her true nature, marries her, and the fairy tale concludes with the union of the now high status adult male with the high status now adult female.

     Prior to the constitutional reforms, military service was an obligation that only accrued to the peasant class. Serving thirty years in the military, however, was an unusually long time. While Paris is most likely used by Kirsten Marie as a referent to a far off, and luxurious land, it is possible that the choice of Paris was more conscious. Urban elites in Copenhagen were well aware of what was going on in Paris, as were many of the better off farmers. Indeed, Paris, the court of the French kings, and the political currents coming from Paris had become a part of the average Danish consciousness already with the Napoleonic wars--and Denmark's disastrous role in the war--since the beginning of the nineteenth century.

     Tang Kristensen included the story in his third volume of &#xC6;ventyr fra Jylland (JF XII 3). It also appears in the fair copy collection as &#xC6;v. 1511, although the actual fair copy is missing.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a soldier who had served for thirty years. So he was going to be able to retire soon. But then he'd dreamed three nights in a row that he was to be king in Paris. He went and asked to be discharged. They said that he was a fool, because he'd never become that. Was discharged and journeyed off anyway. It was so hot and he had gotten thirsty, went into a forest where a stream ran, lay down and wanted to drink. Then there was a lion lying there on the other side and it laughed at him, when he stood up. What are you laughing at. I'm laughing that you want to be king in Paris. You're going to become king, too, but it is going to be after a lot of shit. Now you're to go through three forests and then someone will come to you and ask if you don't want to have him as a servant, but you may not take him. Then another one will come, but you shouldn't take him either. But the third one you should take as your servant, he'll be true to you. Now you have something that can never be taken. Money. Now when you get out into the middle of the forest, you'll come to a house, you are to go in there. Here is a hat, too, when you spin it, it shoots off two hundred cannon salvos out of each corner of the triangle, and here is a sword, everything that you bare its edges to will fall. -- There is an old bitty, she will want you to go and get the lamp that is burning down in the cellar. She'll want you to give it to her before you get back up, because then she'll let you fall down in there and then she'll kill you. You need to bring it up with you. There's a big genie down there. As soon as you light the lamp, wherever you may be, then the genie will come and he'll give you whatever you ask for. But when it comes to honor and worth, remember me. Then he journeyed on. When he'd gone a while, a young man came up to him and asked if he didn't want him as his servant. But he said no to that. Then he came to the second. He said no as well. To the third. Could he have him as a servant. Servant, you don't need a servant, since he'd gotten to the house first and got the lamp. Then he answers and said it didn't matter either way to him and then he reaches down in his pocket and took a handful of money and gave it to him. Then he wanted to be his servant when he saw that he had enough money. Then he came to this little house, and he went in and there was no one there but an old woman, who was sitting in there. Then he said, good evening, Mutter. Good evening, little son, are you here, I've waited for you for so long. Can't you go down to the cellar and bring up the wall lamp that's burning down there for me. So he went down and there was this genie. Then she shouted: Oh, give me the lamp, little son, I'm afraid you're going to break it. No, I'll take care of it, he said. Then he came up and showed the edge of his sword to her and she lay and was dead, and then he journeyed off with it. Then he said to his servant, Can you show us the best inn there is in Paris. Oh, god help us, he said, we'd better go to one of the simpler places. No, he wanted to go to the very best. Then he showed him up to one that was right across from the king's castle. Then that evening as they sat there, he said, what's that music we can hear. Oh, that's the king's daughter who is playing piano. Then he lit the lamp and then the genie stood before him. What do you wish my lord. I wish that you would get me a piano, twice as good as the one she is playing. So then he started to play on it the next day and the princess hears it. He sold it to her and for a lot of money and got quite a bit for it. Then he lit his lamp again and the genie stood before him again. What do you wish my lord. I want you to get me the princess to come over here for an hour each night. Yes, that would happen. Now it was discovered and they tie a bag of peas around her neck because they want to see where she goes. They could tell that she wasn't sleeping soundly at night. But the king becomes so desperate when he sees this and he puts him in the tower next door. Then he sat in there and there was a guard in front there. He asks the guard if he can't call for his servant because he had his lighter and he couldn't light his lamp. No, said the guard, he didn't dare do that. He reaches down in his pocket and takes a handful of money and passes it out the slot to him. Then he got him and then he lit his lamp and then the genie stands before him. What do you wish... I want you to build me a tower twice as high as this one before morning. Things get very busy but the next morning, the king woke up and he rubbed his eyes when he looked out and saw the giant tower. Then the king got scared and now he didn't dare deny him his daughter any longer. He married her and then he asked her to give him his hat and his sword and then he told her what qualities they had. Then she had ones just like them made and then the king ordered everyone to war and then this prince was to go out and fight, but he didn't want to have any soldiers, he could do it himself. He asked her for his hat and sword and she gave them to him. When he came out to the enemy, he spun his hat and said fire, but no it wouldn't fire. Then he realized he'd been tricked. He showed them his sword, but that didn't serve him either. Then he was captured and they made a giant bonfire and he was to be burned there. Then he asked if he couldn't have a pipe before he was to be burned, and they thought it was a shame to deny the Prince that. Asked if he couldn't light it with his own lighter. Was allowed to do so. Then his servant came with it and then he lit the lamp and then the genie stood there before him, and then he said, what do you wish my lord. I want you to cut all these soldiers down at their knees. He did that too and then he went in to his wife and then she was so sad and that she had made a mistake, and then she came with the real ones and gave them to him. Then he showed her the edge of his sword and then she lay there and was dead on account of her betrayal. Then he journeyed off to the lion who lay by the stream. Will you now chop my head off she said. He didn't want to do that, but he did it and then she was a much wished for Princess and so he married her and he became king in Paris and lived well.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en Soldat, der havde v&#xE6;ret 30 Aar i Tjenesten. Saa kunde han snart have kommet til at faa Pension, men da dr&#xF8;mte han i tre N&#xE6;tter i Tr&#xE6;k, at han skulde v&#xE6;re Konge i Paris, og saa gik han hen og forlangte hans Afsked. De sagde, at han var en Nar, der saadan vilde lade hans Pension gaa fra sig for den Dr&#xF8;ms Skuld, for den gik aldrig i Opfyldelse. Saa fik han hans Afsked og rejste lige godt. Det var saa varmt i Vejret, og han blev t&#xF8;rstig, men da han saa kommer ind i en Skov, hvor der l&#xF8;ber en B&#xE6;k, saa l&#xE6;gger han sig ned og vil drikke. Men da ligger der en L&#xF8;ve ved den anden Side af B&#xE6;kken og ler ad ham, da han rejser sig igjen. "Hvad ler du ad?" siger han. "A ler ad, at du vil v&#xE6;re Konge i Paris. Det bliver du ogsaa, men det sker kun med stor M&#xF8;je. Nu skal du igjennem tre Skove, og der kommer da &#xE9;n til dig i den f&#xF8;rste Skov og sp&#xF8;rger, om du vil ikke have ham til Tjener, men ham maa du ikke tage. Saa kommer du i den anden Skov, og der kommer atter &#xE9;n til dig og tilbyder sig at ville v&#xE6;re din Tjener, men ham skal du heller ikke tage. Endelig kommer du i den tredje Skov, og den tredje, der da kommer til dig, ham skal du tage til Tjener, for han vil v&#xE6;re dig tro, og det gj&#xE6;lder det saa meget for dig om. Der har du nu en Pung, den kan aldrig fattes Penge, og saa har du der et Sv&#xE6;rd, alt det, du viser Eggen af det, det falder. Saa har du ogsaa her en hat, den er trekantet, som du ser, og naar du snor den, saa flyver der 200 Kanonskud ud af hvert hj&#xF8;rne. Naar du kommer nu midt ind i den sidste Skov, saa kommer du til et hus, og der skal du gaa ind. Der er en gammel Kj&#xE6;lling, og hun vil have dig ned at hente et Lys, der staar og br&#xE6;nder nede i Kj&#xE6;lderen. Det skal du gaa ned og tage men hun vil forlange det af dig, inden du kommer op. Du skal imidlertid ikke lade hende faa det, for saa lader hun dig platte ned i Kj&#xE6;lderen igjen, og saa kv&#xE6;ler hun dig. Du skal tage det op med dig og beholde det. Der ligger en stor Staalmand der nede i den Kj&#xE6;lder, ham kan du kalde til dig, hvor som helst du er, saa snart du t&#xE6;nder Ild i det Lys, for saa kommer han og sp&#xF8;rger om, hvad du befaler, og saa kan du altid faa af ham, hvad du begj&#xE6;rer. Men for det a har nu givet dig Underretning om det, saa beder a dig om, at du kommer mig i hu, naar du kommer til &#xC6;re og V&#xE6;rdighed". Ja, det lovede han, og saa rejste han videre.
Da han kommer saa et Stykke hen, saa kommer den f&#xF8;rste Karl til ham og sp&#xF8;rger, om han vil ikke have ham til Tjener. Men det siger han nej til. Saa kommer han i den anden Skov, og der kommer atter &#xE9;n til ham. Ham vilde han heller ikke have. Endelig i den tredje Skov, da han kommer til den tredje Karl, sp&#xF8;rger han, om han kunde ikke faa ham til Tjener. "Tjener! du tr&#xE6;nger saam&#xE6;nd ingen Tjener for". Jo, han vilde da gj&#xE6;rne have ham, og saa r&#xE6;kker han ned i Pungen og tager en haandfuld Penge og giver ham. Ja, saa vilde han ogsaa nok v&#xE6;re Tjener for ham, han saa jo, at han havde Penge nok, og saa fulgtes han med ham. De kommer saa til dether lille hus, som L&#xF8;ven havde talt om, og der gik Soldaten ind. Der var ikke andre der inde end en gammel Kone, og han sagde: "God Aften Mutter!" &#x2014; "God Aften, S&#xE6;nle, (S&#xF8;nlille) svarer hun, "er du der? A har ventet efter dig saa l&#xE6;nge. Vil du ikke gaa ned i Kj&#xE6;lderen og tage mig det Vogslys op, der staar og br&#xE6;nder?" Jo, saa gik han ogsaa derned. Der laa denher store Staalmand. Da han nu havde taget Lyset og vilde op igjen, raaber hun: "Aa, giv mig Lyset, S&#xE6;nte, a er r&#xE6;d, du faar det i Stykker." &#x2014; "Nej, a skal nok passe paa det," siger han, og saa kom han op med det i haanden, og saa viste han hende Eggen af hans Sabel. Da laa hun strags og var d&#xF8;d. Saa rejste han videre med Lyset og hans andre Sager.
Da de kom saa ud af Skoven, var de i N&#xE6;rheden af Paris. Saa Siger han til hans Tjener: "Kan du vise os den villeste Gj&#xE6;stgivergaard, der er her i Paris?" -- "Aa, Gud hj&#xE6;lp os," siger han, "vi maa hellere gaa paa en af de simple, den villeste er alt for dyr." Nej, de vilde paa den alvilleste. Saa viste Tjeneren ham ogsaa en, der laa lige overfor Kongens Slot, og der kom de ind.
Om Aftingen, de sad, saa siger han den gamle soldat: "Hvad er det for en Musik, vi kan h&#xF8;re?" &#x2014; "Aa, det er Kongens Datter, der spiller paa Klaver." Saa t&#xE6;nder han hans Lys, og da staar Staalmanden for ham. "Hvad begj&#xE6;rer min Herre?" &#x2014; "A begj&#xE6;rer, at du skal skaffe mig et Klaver dobbelt saa godt som det, Prinsessen spiller paa." Naa ja, Staalmanden rejste af og kom snart med det. Saa gav han sig til at spille paa det Aftenen efter, og prinsessen h&#xF8;rer paa det. Saa kommer hun og vil kj&#xF8;be det af ham. Nej, han vilde ikke s&#xE6;lge det, men da hun b&#xF8;d ham mange Penge for det, saa lod han hende endelig faa det. Aftenen efter t&#xE6;ndte han hans Lys igjen, og Staalmanden kommer og sp&#xF8;rger: "Hvad begj&#xE6;rer min Herre?" &#x2014; "A begj&#xE6;rer, du skal skaffe mig Prinsessen her over en Time hver Nat." Ja, det skulde Ske, og hun kom ogsaa. Staalmanden hentede hende hver eneste Aften. Nu kunde de nok m&#xE6;rke, hun havde en urolig S&#xF8;vn om Natten, og de blev ogsaa kloge paa, at hun blev hentet et andet Sted hen. For nu at faa det opdaget, hvor hun rejste hen, bandt de en Pose &#xC6;rter om hendes hals, og saa fandt de ud af det. Der var jo hul paa Posen, og &#xC6;rterne viste dem Vej. Kongen blev saa desperat, da han saa, hvor hun havde v&#xE6;ret, at han lod Soldaten s&#xE6;tte ind i et Taarn ved Siden af Slottet, og der blev sat Skildvagt for ham. Saa sad han jo der inde, og saa beder han Skildvagten om at kalde ad hans Tjener, for han kunde ikke faa hans Lys t&#xE6;ndt, og Tjeneren havde hans Fyrt&#xF8;j. Nej, siger Skildvagten, det turde han ikke. Saa r&#xE6;kker han ned i Lommen og tager en haandfuld Penge, og flyr dem ud ad Spr&#xE6;kken til ham. Det hjalp, og saa hentede han Tjeneren. Soldaten beder ham om at hente Fyrt&#xF8;jet, og da han faar det, saa t&#xE6;nder han Lyset, og da staar Staalmanden for ham igjen. "Hvad befaler min Herre?" -- "A befaler, du skal bygge mig et Taarn inden Dag, og det Skal v&#xE6;re dobbelt saa Stort som dether, og staa ved Siden af, lige uden for Kongens Vinduer." Naa, der blev travlt, men om Morgenen, da Kongen han vaagnede og kom til at se ud, da maatte han gnide hans &#xD8;jne, for han saa det store Taarn og kunde aldrig begribe, hvor det kom fra. Han h&#xF8;rer, og han frager, og endelig bliver det da oplyst, at det er Soldaten, der har ladet det bygge om Natten. Nu blev Kongen r&#xE6;d og turde ikke n&#xE6;gte ham hans Datter l&#xE6;ngere.
Han bliver saa gift med hende. Saa beder han hende om at gjemme (putte) hans Hat og hans Sv&#xE6;rd, og han fortalte hende, hvad Egenskab der var ved det. Saa fik hun Magen til lavet og havde det i Beredskab, og ingen kunde kjende det fra hverandt. Da gaar det saadan, at der kommer Krig paa, og denher Prins, for nu var Soldaten jo bleven Prins, han skulde ud at slaas. Men han vilde ingen krigsfolk have med, han kunde nok Selv gj&#xF8;re det ud, sagde han. Da han drog af, bad han hans Kone, om hun vilde fly ham hans Hat og hans Sv&#xE6;rd, og saa kom hun med de Dele, hun havde ladet lave. Da han kom nu ud til Fjenden, snoebe han Hatten og sagde: "Fyr!" men nej, den vilde ikke fyre. Saa m&#xE6;rkede han, han var narret. Han viste dem Sv&#xE6;rdet, men det vilde heller ikke gj&#xF8;re Tjeneste. Enden paa det blev, at han blev fanget, og der blev et stort sv&#xE6;rt Baal stilt an, som han skulde br&#xE6;ndes paa. Da han nu stod paa Baalet, bad han, om han maatte da ikke faa en pibe Tobak, inden han skulde br&#xE6;ndes, og det tykte de da var Synd at n&#xE6;gte Prinsen. Han bad dern&#xE6;st, om han maatte ikke t&#xE6;nde ved hans eget Fyrt&#xF8;j, og det fik han Lov til. Saa kom hans Tjener med det, og saa t&#xE6;ndte han Lyset, og saa stod Staalmanden for ham igjen. Han sagde: "Hvad befaler min Herre?" &#x2014; "A befaler, du skal slaa mig alle hele de Krigsfolk af i Kn&#xE6;erne!" Det gjorde han, og saa var Prinsen fri. Nu rejste han hjem til hans Kone, og hun var da saa meget s&#xF8;rgen, lod hun, hun havde saadan og saadan taget fejl og havde saadan fortr&#xF8;dt det. Her var nu det rigtige, og saa flyede hun ham det. Saa viste han hende Eggen af hans Sabel, og da laa hun og var d&#xF8;d for hendes Utroskabs Skyld. Nu var han i hans V&#xE6;rdighed igjen, og saa kom han i Tanker om L&#xF8;ven, der havde v&#xE6;ret saa god ved ham og endnu laa ved B&#xE6;kken og ventede. Saa rejste han hen til hende, og hun blev glad, da hun saa ham, og sagde: "Vil du nu hugge mit Hoved af?" Det var han ikke for, men da hun bad ham meget om det, saa gjorde han det, og saa blev hun til en skj&#xF8;n Prinsesse, der havde v&#xE6;ret for&#xF8;nsket. Saa holdt han Bryllup med hende, og de levede al deres Tid som Konge og Dronning i Paris, og havde det godt.

    <english_publication>Once there was a soldier who had served in the army for thirty years. He was soon going to be eligible to receive a pension but then he dreamed three nights in a row that he was going to become king in Paris, and so he went and asked to be discharged. They said that he was a fool, leaving his pension for the sake of a dream because it would never come true. Then he was discharged and he traveled off. 
     The weather was very warm and he got thirsty, so he went into a forest where there was a stream, and he lay down to drink from it. But then there was a lioness lying there on the other side of the stream and it laughs at him when he gets up. "What are you laughing at?" he says. "I'm laughing at you because you want to be king in Paris. You'll become king too, but it is only going to happen after a lot of crap. Now you're going to go through three forests, and someone is going to come up to you in the first forest and ask you if you don't want him to be your servant, but you are not to take him. Then you'll go into the second forest, and yet another person is going to come to you and offer to be your servant, but you're not to take him either. Finally, you'll go into the third forest and the third one that comes up to you, that's the one you should take as your servant, since he'll be true to you, and that is going to be really important for you. Here is a wallet, it can never be emptied of money, and here is a sword, everything that you show its edge to will fall. And here is a hat, it has three corners as you see, and when you spin it, then two hundred canon salvos come out of each corner. Now when you get to the middle of this last forest you will come to a house, and you are to go in there. There is an old hag who lives there and she will ask you to go down to get a candle that is burning down in the cellar. You're to go down and get it but she'll ask you for it before you come up. You should make sure she doesn't get it because then she'll push you back down into the cellar and then she'll kill you. You're to take it up with you and keep it. There is a large genie down there in the cellar, you can call him to you wherever you are, and as soon as you light that candle, he'll come and ask you your command, and then you can always get from him whatever you desire. But since I've now given you all this information about this, I ask that you remember me when you reach a position of honor and respect." Yes, he promised her that and then he traveled on.
      When he had gone a little way, the first person comes up to him and asks if he'd like to have him as his servant. But he says no to that offer. Then he goes into the second forest, and another one comes up to him. He won't take him as his servant either. Finally in the third forest he meets the third guy and asks him if he'll be his servant. "Servant! You don't need a servant!" Well, he really wanted to have him and so he reaches down in his wallet and takes out a handful of money and gives it to him. Well, then he would be willing to be his servant, he saw that he had enough money and then he followed along with him. They come to this little house that the lioness had mentioned, and the soldier went in. The only person there was an old woman, and he said, "Good evening, Mutter!" -- "Good evening, my little son," she answers, "are you here? I've waited so long for you. Would you go down in the cellar and get me that candle that is burning down there?" Sure, and so he went down there. That giant genie was lying down there. When he'd gotten hold of the candle and was going to come up again, she shouts, "Oh, give me the candle, son, I'm afraid you'll break it." -- "No, I'll take good care of it," he says, and then he came up holding it in his hand, and he showed her the edge of his saber. She immediately fell down dead. Then he traveled on with the candle and his other things.
     When they got out of the forest they were on the outskirts of Paris. Then he says to his servant, "Can you bring us to the nicest inn here in all of Paris?" -- "Oh, God help us," he says, "we'd better go to one of the more simple ones, the nicest one is far too expensive." No, he wanted to go to the very best. Then the servant showed him to one that was right across from the king's castle and they took their lodgings there.
     In the evening as they were sitting there, the old soldier says, "What is that music we can hear?" -- "Oh, that's the king's daughter, she's playing piano." Then he lights the candle, and the genie appears before him. "What does my master desire?" -- "I want you to get me a piano twice as good as the one the princess is playing." Oh sure, the genie traveled off and soon returned with it. And so the next evening, the soldier began playing on it, and the princess hears it. Then she comes and wants to buy it from him. No, he didn't want to sell it, but she offered him a lot of money and he finally let her have it. The next evening, he lit the candle again, and the genie comes and asks, "What does my master desire?" -- "I want you to get the princess over here for an hour every night." Yes, that would happen, and she came too. The genie went and got her every evening. Now over in the castle they noticed that the princess wasn't sleeping well at night and they also discovered that she was being brought somewhere else. To figure out where she was going, they tied a bag of peas around her neck, and so they were able to find out where she was going. There was a hole in the bag and the peas showed them the way. The king gets so upset when he discovers where she's been going that he had the soldier placed in the tower next to the castle, and placed a round-the-clock guard on him. He sat there and then he asked the guard to call for his servant because he couldn't light his candle and his servant had his lighter. No, says the guard, he didn't dare do that. Then he reaches down into his pocket and takes up a fistful of money and throws it out the slot to him. That helped and he went and got his servant. The soldier asks him to get his flint and when he gets it he lights the candle, and then the genie is standing there in front of him again. "What does my master command?" -- "I command you to build me a tower before dawn twice as big as this one and right beside it here outside of the king's windows." Well, things got busy but the next morning when the king woke up and looked outside he had to rub his eyes because he saw the giant tower and couldn't for the life of him figure out where it had come from. He asks around and finally he is informed that the soldier had had it built during the night. Now the king got scared and he didn't dare deny the soldier his daughter any longer.
     So the soldier marries her. Then he asks her to put his hat and his sword away for safe keeping, and he told her about their special qualities. Then she had ones made that were exact copies and had them ready, and no one could tell them apart. Then it happens that war breaks out, and this prince--since the soldier had now become a prince--he was to go out and fight. But he didn't want any warriors with him, he could do it by himself, he said. When he was going off, he asked his wife to give him his hat and his sword, and she came with the copies she'd had made. Now when he got out to the enemy, he spun his hat and said, "Fire!" But no, it wouldn't fire. Then he realized he'd been tricked. He showed them the sword, but it wouldn't do its duty either. 
     The end result was that he was captured, and they built a huge bonfire, he was to be burned on it. As he stood by the bonfire, he asked if he couldn't have a pipe of tobacco before he was to be burned, and they thought it a shame to deny the prince that. He then asked if he couldn't light it with his own flint, and they gave him permission to do so. Then his servant came with it, and then he lit the candle, and then the genie stood there before him again. He said, "What does my master command?" -- "I command you to cut down all of these warriors at the knees!" He did that and then the prince was free. 
     Now he traveled home to his wife and she said that she was so sorry, she had made such a big mistake and she regretted it deeply. Here were the real ones and she gave them to him. Then he showed her the edge of his saber and she fell down dead, killed because of her unfaithfulness. Now he was back to his worthy position again and he remembered the lioness that had been so good to him and was still lying by the stream waiting. So he traveled off to her, and she became very happy when she saw him and said, "Will you chop my head off now?" He didn't want to do that, but she begged and pleaded, and so he did that, and then she turned into a beautiful and much wished for princess. So he married her and they lived the rest of their lives as king and queen in Paris, and had a wonderful life.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie continues with a standard variant of ATU 325, "The Magician and His Pupil".

     Holbek points out that these tales, however fanciful, reflect not only psychological tensions between the generations and the sexes, but also the economic tensions that animate day to day life in rural Denmark. 

     Large family size was one of the greatest factors that contributed to persistent rural poverty. Since farm plots were generally small, inheritance of the land (when possible and not limited by non-inheritable leaseholds) usually went to the oldest son. In many cases there was no inheritance at all, and the oldest along with the rest of the children were essentially left to fend for themselves.

     Once the children reached confirmation age, they usually left home to work at other farms. Schooling also ended at the same time. The young boy's ploy to get work from the magician echoes the switch Kirsten Marie's father plays on the beggar bailiff in an earlier story (KMP 1.03). Amusingly, the protagonist in this story has to renounce the very education that was intended to allow him to find work and contribute to society in a meaningful fashion.

     Family size and the limited opportunities afforded adult children also contributed to the development of the itinerant class of beggars and merchants who are an important feature of Kirsten Marie's storytelling. The horse peddler is of course another manifestation of that itinerant class.

     Tang Kristensen did not publish this tale in any of his collections.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was once a man who had so many children and then when the oldest got a little bigger, he wanted to go out and look for work. So he left and he met someone who was riding. What are you looking for little boy. I'm out walking and looking for work. Would you like to serve me. Sure, I can just as well work for you as for someone else. Can you read. Yes, I can. We were many children but my father made sure we learned our learning. Well, then I can't use you. So he turned his clothes around and ran around back and then he met him again and then the same conversation repeats itself. Can you read. No, I certainly can't. Yes, well then I can use you. You can climb up here on back and come with me home. Then he rode home. When they got home he said, here is a room with lots of books, now I need you to keep them clean, don't do anything else. The boy read and read a bit in the books, and they were different kinds of arts, he could turn himself into whatever he wanted. And the man, they called him the black magician. Then he traveled away from the town and said to the boy: Now, take care of the books and keep them clean. There was to be a market and his father really needed money. So he decided to turn himself into a horse and his father could sell him and could get a lot of money for him. He brought him to market too and there was the black magician as well, and he recognized the horse. Then he wanted to buy him from the man. But the boy had forbidden his father, he wasn't to sell him with his halter on, take it off the horse. There were so many who wanted to buy the horse, but the black magician offered so much. He didn't want to sell it with the halter. Finally sell it with the halter, otherwise he didn't want it. He got the horse and led it home. He forbade his people to take the halter off of him. Each day he was let out and was watered, and he scraped and scraped at his nose and wanted to take the halter off. One day a young boy came out there, they had so many children, and he said, oh come on, let's take the halter off of him, he can't drink with the halter on. As soon as it came off, he turned himself into a bird and flew out of the door. Then the magician came out and turned himself into a hawk and went after the bird. Then they came to a princess's window and she saw the little bird that the hawk was chasing and she opened the window and the bird flew in and the hawk had to stay outside. A few days later, a horse dealer came there and then he said to the princess that he would now turn himself into a gold ring and put himself on her finger and the only thing the dealer wanted to buy would be the gold ring, but when you sell it, you have to let it fall on the table first. Then he turned himself into a barley corn and then the magician would turn into a rooster and take the barley corn but the boy turned himself into a fox and bit the head off of the rooster. When he got bigger, he got the princess and they live well.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en Gang en Mand, han havde saa mange B&#xF8;rn. Da den &#xE6;ldste blev noget stor, saa vilde han ud og s&#xF8;ge sig en Tjeneste. Som han nu gaar, saa kommer han til &#xE9;n, der kommer ridende. &#x201D;Hvad gaar du efter, bitte Dreng?&#x201D; siger han. &#x201D;A gaar for og vil ud og have mig en Tjeneste.&#x201D; &#x2013;  &#x201D;Vil du saa ikke tjene mig?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja a kan lige saa godt tjene her som en anden,&#x201D; siger Drengen. &#x201D;Kan du l&#xE6;se?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, a kan. Vi har mange B&#xF8;rn, men min Fader s&#xF8;rgede godt for os i den Retning, vi skulde l&#xE6;re vor L&#xE6;rdom.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, saa kan a ikke bruge dig, a skal have en Dreng, der ikke kan l&#xE6;se,&#x201D; og han drog saa videre. Men Drengen kunde nok have Lyst til at faa Tjenesten, og saa rendte han om og vendte hans Kl&#xE6;der og l&#xF8;b saadan omkring, at han m&#xF8;dte Manden igjen. Nu gjentager det samme sig. Manden sp&#xF8;rger, om han vil tjene ham, og om han kan l&#xE6;se. &#x201D;Nej, a kan saa m&#xE6;nd ej,&#x201D; siger Drengen. &#x201D;Jo, saa kan a bruge dig. Nu kan du s&#xE6;tte dig op her bag paa, og saa f&#xF8;lge med mig hjem.&#x201D; Saa kom han op at ride. Da de kom hjem, siger han: &#x201D;Her er et Kammer med saa mange B&#xF8;ger, nu kan du holde dem rene, og du skal ikke bestille andet.&#x201D; Drengen han gik saa mellem B&#xF8;gerne hver Dag og l&#xE6;ste i dem. Han l&#xE6;rte nu meget af dem, og der var nu saadan Anvisning paa, hvordan en skulde b&#xE6;re sig ad med at gj&#xF8;re Kunster og skabe sig i hvad en vilde. Manden han tjente ved, ham kaldte de den sorte Kunstner. Han rejste tit fra By, og saa sagde han til Drengen: &#x201D;Se nu til, du passer paa B&#xF8;gerne og holder dem godt rene.&#x201D; Nu vidste Drengen, at hans Fader var saa forlegen for Penge, og saa h&#xF8;rte han, at der skulde v&#xE6;re Marked i N&#xE6;rheden. Nu tykte han jo, han havde l&#xE6;rt en hel Del, og saa gaar han hjem til hans Fader og siger: &#x201D;Nu vil a skabe mig i en Hest og saa skal du tr&#xE6;kke til Marked med den og s&#xE6;lge den, og du kan faa mange Penge for den. Men du maa vide, du ikke s&#xE6;lger den med Grimen paa, den maa du endelig huske at tage af og beholde.&#x201D; Det lovede Faderen, og saa tog han ham ogsaa til Marked. Den sorte Kunstner var der ogsaa, og han kunde kjende Hesten og vilde kj&#xF8;be den af Manden. Der var mange andre, der vilde kj&#xF8;be den Hest, for den var saa p&#xE6;n, men den sorte Kunstner b&#xF8;d mest. Manden vilde ikke s&#xE6;lge Grimen med den, og den fremmede vilde absolut have Grimen med. Endelig b&#xF8;d han saa meget, at Manden ikke tykte, han kunde lade ham gaa fra sig, men hvis han ikke kunde faa Grimen med, saa vilde han ikke have den. Altsaa slog Drengens Fader til, og den sorte Kunstner fik Hesten og trak den med sig hjem. Nu forb&#xF8;d han hans Folk at tage Grimen af den. Hver Dag den var ude at blive vandet, saa skrabte den og skrabte paa N&#xE6;sen og vilde absolut have Grimen af. Nu havde Kunstneren mange B&#xF8;rn, og en Dag &#xE9;n af dem kom derud og saa det, sagde han: &#x201D;Aa, lad os tage Grimen af ham, han kan jo ikke godt drikke med Grimen paa.&#x201D; De tager den saa af, men det f&#xF8;rste de har gjort det, saa skabte Hesten sig om til en Fugl, og saa fl&#xF8;j han. Da kommer Kunstneren ind ad Porten i det samme, og han ser, hvad der er gaaet for sig, og skaber sig saa i en H&#xF8;g og stikker &#xE6;bag efter Fuglen. Den kom saa hen i N&#xE6;rheden af en Prinsesses Vindue, og da hun ser den bitte Fugl, og hvordan H&#xF8;gen var efter den, saa lukkede hun et Vindue op, og Fuglen fl&#xF8;j ind, men H&#xF8;gen maatte kj&#xF8;nt blive udenfor. Fuglen skabte sig nu i en Karl og sagde til Prinsessen, at han nu vilde gj&#xF8;re sig til en Guldering, som hun kunde s&#xE6;tte paa hendes Finger, og saa vilde der nok komme en Handelsmand, som vilde kj&#xF8;be Gulderinge, og hun maatte nok s&#xE6;lge den til ham, men hun skulde lade den platte ned paa Skiven f&#xF8;rst. Nogle Dage efter kom Handelsmanden ogsaa og spurgte Prinsessen, om hun ikke vilde s&#xE6;lge den Guldering, hun der have paa hendes Finger. Jo, det kunde blive godt, og de blev enige om Prisen. Saa tog hun den af Fingeren og lod den platte ned paa Skiven. Da lad han sig skabe i en Bygkj&#xE6;rne, og saa skabte Kunstneren sig i en Kok, for det var ingen andre end ham, der havde givet sig ud for Pranger. Kokken vilde nu tage Bygkj&#xE6;rnen, men saa skabte Drengen sig i en R&#xE6;v og bed Hovedet af Kokken. Saa var det forbi med Kunstneren, og Drengen blev ved Prinsessen, og da han blev stor, giftede hun sig med ham, og saa lever de godt med hverandre.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Once upon a time, there was a man who had so many children. When the oldest one had gotten fairly big, he decided he wanted to go out and find a job. As he is walking along, he meets a person who is riding by. &#x201C;What are you out after, little boy?&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going out to find a job.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t you work for me?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Sure, I can just as well work for you as for someone else,&#x201D; says the boy. &#x201C;Can you read?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, I can. We have a lot of children, but my father made sure on that account, we all had to learn our learning.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, then I can&#x2019;t use you, I need a boy who can&#x2019;t read,&#x201D; and he rode on. But the boy now wanted the job, and so he ran around and turned his clothes inside out, and he ran over so that he met up with the man again. Now the same thing happens again. The man asks if he wants to work for him, and whether he can read. &#x201C;No, I certainly cannot,&#x201D; says the boy. &#x201C;Well, then I can use you. Now you can get up here on back, and then come along with me.&#x201D; Then he got up to ride. When they got home, he says: &#x201C;Here is a room with a lot of books, you are to keep them clean and do nothing else.&#x201D; The boy went there among the books every day and read them. He learned a lot from them, and there was instruction in how to do magic and turn oneself into whatever one wanted. People called the man that he worked for the Black Magician. The magician often traveled, and then he would say to the boy: &#x201C;Make sure that you take care of the books and keep then nice and clean.&#x201D; Now the boy knew that his father needed money, and then he heard that there was to be a market nearby. Now he thought that he&#x2019;d learned quite a bit, and so he goes home to his father and says: &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;m going to turn myself into a horse and you&#x2019;re to bring that horse to market and sell it, and you can get a lot of money for it. But you have to remember, you are not to sell me with the halter on, you have to remember to take it off and keep it.&#x201D; The father promised that, and then he took him to the market. The Black Magician was there too, and he recognized the horse and wanted to buy it from the man. There were many others who wanted to buy that horse, since it was so beautiful, but the Black Magician bid the most. The man wouldn&#x2019;t sell the halter with it, and the magician absolutely wanted to have the halter. Finally, he bid so much that the man didn&#x2019;t feel he could let him walk away, but if he couldn&#x2019;t have the halter, then he didn&#x2019;t want it. Then the boy&#x2019;s father made a decision, and the Black Magician got the horse and led it home with him. Now the magician forbade his people from taking the halter off. Every day that it was led outside to be watered, it scraped and scraped at its nose and absolutely wanted the halter off. Now the magician had lots of children, and one day one of them came out there and saw that and he said: &#x201C;Oh, let&#x2019;s take the halter off of him, he can&#x2019;t really drink with the halter on.&#x201D; They take it off, but as soon as they&#x2019;ve done that, the horse turned itself into a bird and flew off. Then the magician comes in the door at that moment and he sees what has happened, and he turns himself into a hawk and flies off after the bird. The bird got close to a princess&#x2019;s window, and when she sees the little bird and how the hawk was chasing it, she opens her window and the bird flew in, but the hawk had to stay outside. The bird changed itself into a young man and said to the princess that he was now going to turn himself into a gold ring, that she could put on her finger, and a traveling salesman (horse trader) would come who wanted to buy the ring, and she could sell it to him, but she was to let it drop onto the table first. A few days later a traveling salesman came and asked the princess if she wanted to sell the gold ring that she had on her finger. Sure, that would be good, and they agreed on the price. Then she took it off her finger and let it drop down onto the plate. Then he turned himself into a barley corn, and the magician turned himself into a rooster, because it was no other than he who had pretended to be a horse trader. The rooster wanted to take the barley corn, but then the boy turned himself into a fox and bit the head off of the rooster. Then that was the end for the magician, and the boy stayed with the princess and when he got older, he married her, and they lived happily together the rest of their lives.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie returns to localized legends with this next story. Quite possibly, she took a rest while Tang Kristensen finished writing the long fairy tales she had just told him. When he was ready to start again, she returned to the realm of believable, everyday stories.

     There is no clear evaluation of the doppelg&#xE4;nger that she tells about in the story. Indeed, Kirsten Marie appears to be neutral about whether the farmhand's ability to be two places at once is good or bad, reporting it simply as an observed experience. Numerous stories attest to the divisible nature of the human spirit in Danish folk belief (DS VI 21, 33), a topic considered by Feilberg in his consideration of the spirit in Danish folk belief (Feilberg 1914). In this story, the farmhand is able to project himself back to the farm. The ability to appear to be two places at once could of course have its benefits.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie's earlier dismissal of the abilities of cunning folk is reversed in this dramatic story of a sudden cure. The grandfather believes that the cunning man has predicted his wife's death, and there is considerable narrative tension that builds up as he returns home. The tension is relieved by his wife's humorous outburst that also serves as a confirmation of the abilities of at least this particular cunning man. Her great grandfather must be skeptical of the abilities of cunning folk, and therefore is unable to understand her seemingly miraculous cure.

     Kirsten Marie told another version of this tale as the first story in her second session with Tang Kristensen (KMP 2.01). Tang Kristensen chose to publish that later variant.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story fragment is nearly incomprehensible by itself, and Tang Kristensen neither published it nor incorporated it into any other story. In all likelihood, Kirsten Marie was trying to remember another story, and could only recall bits and pieces of the tale. Another possibility is that Kirsten Marie had remembered this detail, which was to be included in one of the tales that she had just told him. The registration of the fragment as &#xC6;v 1511b (Brandt 1974) suggests that it was to be incorporated into &#xC6;v 1511 (KMP 1.49), but it is unclear where the fragment would fit in that story. A final possibility is that Tang Kristensen felt he knew the tale so well that he only had to record this small fragment and that he could reconstitute the tale later.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie returns to fairy tales with this version of an ATU 303 tale, "The Twins Or Blood-Brothers." The story follows the standard pattern of the active masculine tale. The tale is divided into two segments, and it would not have been surprising if the story had simply concluded after the death of the false suitor. The second segment solidifies the close connection between the brothers. This variant shares many features with a variant of ATU 300, "The Dragon-Slayer", told by Bitte Jens Kristensen (BJK 1.21).

     The twins are an interesting phenomenon in the fairy tale. Holbek interprets this type of pair as a "split," where "conflicting aspects of a character are distributed upon different figures in the tale. " This split also applies to the king and the dragon (Holbek 1987, 435-6).

     Kirsten Marie makes an amusing meta-narrative comment near the end of her story, emphasizing that the story is a lie. That attitude contrasts markedly with her apparent attitude towards the legends and other personal experience narratives that constitute the bulk of her repertoire.

     Tang Kristensen did not publish this story in any of his collections.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man, he was so poor. And he was a fisherman, and one day he caught a big fish in his net. "Oh, let me go today, and tomorrow you'll catch so many fish in your net." Then the next day, the same fish was in the net. Yes, now you can take me, and give my heart to your wife and my kidneys to your dog, my lungs to your nag and then bury my tongue in your garden and also my liver. Then the wife gives birth to two children, the dog two puppies, the nag two foals, and in the garden two bottles, and then when your children set out in the world, when they are in danger, then the bottle will be red, and two swords will grow, and they have that quality that, whatever you show the edge of the sword to, dies. And that happened too. The oldest son set off and wanted to try his luck. Came to a market town and there was a king there who had a daughter, and they were flying black flags and everyone was so sad. It seems so sad here in the town, what is going on? Well, it was the princess. The king had given her to a dragon that had helped him in a war. Oh, he said. Now it was going to come and get her today. Finished up, got up on his horse, grabs his sword by his side and rides out to her. What are you sitting here for? Couldn't he save her? No, probably not, since the dragon was coming to get her. Wanted to try anyway. The carriage driver's name was the Red Knight, he'd climbed up into a tree, and was scared. And now the dragon came, whistling and roaring, it had three heads. He sat down next to her and she sat and fixed his hair. Who is that sitting in my sweetheart's lap? It was mine before it was yours. Well, let's fight over it. Then the dog and the horse attacked him. Took the tongues, hid them in his pocket. Rode away. She'd bound her gold ring in his hair. Second day, met at the same spot. One with six heads. Same way. Third day. Nine heads. He got rid of all three of them. She promised she'd have him and wait a year for her. Now he wanted to travel for a year and then come back again. The red knight had taken all the heads. He'd saved her, otherwise he'd kill her. Said that. Well, then she was to have him. Asked for a year to mourn, since she'd had that great sorrow. When the year was up, she was to have the Red Knight. Came riding to the same inn. Flags were flying and everything looked so nice. Asked why that was. That was because the princess was to have a big celebration (wedding) today. He sat there with the innkeeper. A piece of the roast. Oh good lord. Tied a note around the dog's neck... roll up a small napkin and they tie the roast in that. Would be fun to have a piece of cake. Well, now he'd see if that was possible. Went off. Good enough with a piece of cake. The Red Knight angry. He didn't want those dog tricks. Yes, well she wanted to say that it was that dog's master who'd saved her. Went up and got him. He was riding down there ... Well, that's a lie... The one who'd been there first had probably taken the tongues out of the heads. The Red Knight was rolled to death in a spiked barrel and the other one got the princess. The first night, he says, what is that light shining out there? An evil old woman, she's probably a witch. Wanted to see her. Oh, no, he really shouldn't. Yes, thought he'd ride out there. Tied up his horse. Went in. Good evening, he said. Thank you, please come in, little son, she said. Oh, I'm so scared of that dog. Won't you take a hair from my head and put in on the dog's nose? Sure. Oh ... horse. Hair, nose. Pulled a clump of hair out of her head, and put it on the horse's nose. Did you do it, little son. Yes. Hair become iron and iron hold tight. Then they were bound in iron chains, both the dog and the horse. She killed him too and tossed him in to all the other dead bodies she had. She had a lot. Now at home they saw that the bottle turned red. Then the other brother left to save his brother. Came to the same inn. As soon as he came in, they began to call him Prince, and he rode down to the castle. She came and greeted him warmly and asked if he'd returned. She was so friendly to him, didn't know that he wasn't her husband. When they were to go to bed, he took his sword and placed it between them. Why did he do that tonight? Yes, well he wanted to use that custom tonight. When they got into bed, he said, what is that light shining out there so clearly? But I told you that last night. Yes, that's right, I didn't remember that, I think I'll go out there again tonight. Wondered if he'd been killed out there. Rode out there. Recognized his brother's horse and dog. Knew that it was there. Went in to the old hag, too. Good evening, little son. Thank you, good evening, Mutter. I'm so scared of your dog. Would you.... He pulled a clump of hair from her head and threw it on the fire. What's crackling? Oh it is lice and shit from her old sow. Would he ... horse. Yes, he did that too... What was it that crackled? Have you done it? Yes. Hair become iron and iron hold tight. But nothing held tight. Go (pus?), he said, and then the horse and dog attacked the hag. You need to bring my brother and his ... back to life, otherwise we'll kill you. Yes, I'll do that little son. And she went in and rooted about among the dead bodies and she found him, had a pot with some salve in it and she smeared it on him and he came back to life. He forced her to release the horse and the dog, and then they killed the hag, and then they brought the salve back home. On the way home, the one said to the other, I lay with your wife last night. Did you lie with my wife last night? And then he became furious and killed him on the road and threw him out into the forest. When they were going to bed, How could it be that you lay your sword between us last night? Oh, that was just something I'd thought up last night. Then he got up and took the pot with him and went out and smeared him back to life. You know, I realize it is a complete lie what I'm sitting here telling. I'd like to have a pot like that too. Then they rode up to the princess, but then she didn't know which one was her husband. But then she stayed with the one who was her husband, and the other one rode home.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The nisse is a well known guardian spirit closely tied to the economic fortunes of a farm. The amusing double theft described in this legend points to the zero sum game that characterizes Foster's description of early peasant societies conceptions of "limited good":  one person's gain is another person's loss (Foster 1965).

     Having a farmhand accompany the nisse on his raid of the nearby farm is a slightly unusual feature of this story. The farmhand's precarious perch in the tree during the fight is reminiscent of the farmhand who tries to witness the conjuring of the devil (KMP 1.07).

     The farmhand's presence also allows Kirsten Marie to tell the fairly common story of how the nisse learns to rest (DS II B 48). The nisse, despite his diminutive size, is able to carry an enormous load. As with many supernatural beings and phenomena, what is immediately visible is often misleading. The nisse's outburst about rest underscores his nonhuman status.</annotation>

He says this to one who was called Terkild, the nisse did, and asked him if he didn't want to come along and steal oats tonight. Terkild said sure. Then they went and they took as much as they each could carry. When they got half way home, they met the Hallendrup nisse, he'd been in Ginderup stealing oats. Now the two started fighting and Terkild climbed into a tree trunk that was to the side there. When they were done fighting, the Ginderup nisse had won. He says to Terkild, "Can you see, Terkild in the trunk, I'm still standing." They got their packs on their backs again, and then they tramped off with them.

    <annotation>The loss of the pipe in the field is an inverse of the motif of finding something in the field, as in the stories of the mound dwellers' baking (Boberg 1938).  It is unclear who has taken the pipe, although the uncle suspects theft, as do the farmhands. The sudden reappearance of the pipe suggests that it had been "borrowed" by the mound dwellers.

      The story focuses primarily on the abilities of the cunning man, Klemmen, to help find the pipe. Ane Margrete also attests to the abilities of Klemmen to "show again" (AMJ 2.07). This ability was widely attested in legend, and was attributed to both cunning folk and wise ministers (AMJ 1.06 and 2.07; JPP 1.06; DS VI 1078).</annotation>

    <annotation>Along with the ability to "show again," many cunning folk were believed to be able to catch thieves (AMJ 2.17). Here, the cunning man plays a simple trick that relies on these widespread beliefs about cunning folks' abilities. The girl, who has no doubt heard many stories about the powers of cunning folk, decides on a strategy that will hide her guilt. Unwittingly, she stumbles into the trap and her transgression is revealed. Kirsten Marie may be suggesting that the cunning folk did not possess supernatural powers, per se, but were rather expert at human psychology. This evaluation of the cunning folk would align well with her stories about their failure to cure ailments.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie returns to stories situated in the immediate locale with this variant of ML4050, "River Claiming Its Due". Common variants of this story include the motif of an ominous voice from the river indicating the impending peril (DS II D 48). Rivers and streams created clear boundaries in the landscape. They could be dangerous to cross because of poor roads, the need to travel even when it was dark, and flooding. The boundary nature of streams and rivers also made them dangerous, at least in narrative, as they represented a powerful limen. The water spirit here demands a sacrifice, and people can do little do stop it, a metaphor for the powerlessness that people can feel when confronted by the uncontrollable forces of nature.

     Kirsten Marie stresses the cruel death the woman suffers as she is buoyed by her skirts before finally succumbing. In another telling of the story, she emphasizes the heartbreak her uncle suffers when he hears the story (KMP 2.11).

     It was common that men and women, when visiting the large market towns such as Randers, would wear their best clothes, helping to explain why the woman was wearing such elaborate skirts. There is a bridge over the Alling river at Sjelbrosten along the road from Mols to Randers. Given Kirsten Marie's reference to the Alling river in her later telling of the story, this is the likely location of the story, rather than the town of Sjelle, which lies farther to the south, and would not be along the likeliest route from Mols to Randers.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie combines kidnapping by the elves and the elf dance in this legend. In earlier stories that she told during this collecting session, she had already mentioned the threat of elves as seductive beings (KMP 1.01) and the negative consequences of dancing with elves (KMP 1.42). Going insane is a common outcome of contact with elves (DS II A 74 and DS II A 76). The shepherd's disappearance is traumatic, but the people at the farm propose a likely, non-supernatural scenario to explain it. The truth behind his disappearance is far more startling, and only the farmhand's quick thinking saves the shepherd. By that time, the damage is already done. Indeed, in many stories of encounters with elves and mound dwellers, the human is often marked for life or killed (PJ 2.11). 

     The farmhand does not appear to be using the scythe in a magical manner in this story. In other encounters with the supernatural, the use of knives, other sharp metallic objects, or any worked metal for that matter, usually breaks the supernatural bonds that tie the victim to the other world, although not always with impunity (DS I 639).</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is a retelling of a story Kirsten Marie had told the day before (KMP 1.19). The story is similar to the earlier version, and confirms that legend (and personal experience narrative) can be crystallized in performance (Tangherlini 2003; Siikala 1990). Despite the crystallization, there are certain changes: the order of unbound phrases, place names, and word choice have all been slightly altered (Labov and Waletzky 1967). The etiological tag that explains how the church got its name, and how the mound came into being, remains a prominent feature of the story.

     In the previous telling, Kirsten Marie had used the words "joor" and "boor," which were normalized to "jord" and "b&#xE5;rer" for "earth" and "fallow fields." In this telling, she substitutes the word "h&#xE5;r'e" (=h&#xE5;rde) for "joor" and the word "b&#xE5;re" for "boor." It may well be that Tang Kristensen normalized the spelling while writing, as he does not appear to be concerned with noting dialect or alternate pronunciations in this particular recording. The substitution of h&#xE5;rde for jord makes the interpretation of the mound woman's appeal easier: here she asks that he ride on the hard--presumably the road or path--and not on the fields.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A farmhand came riding past a mound on Tendrup field once, they call it Hvonbj&#xE6;rg. Then a fine lady came running down from the mound and asked him to stop while she poured him a snaps. He stopped and he took the gold cup from her but instead of drinking it, he threw it behind himself, and a couple of drops landed on the horse, it took all the skin off of the horse in those places. He kept the drinking horn and took off as fast as he could, right across the fields, and she set off after him and asked him to ride on the hard and not on the plowed fields because she couldn't run on the plowed land but had to follow the road. She ran with a large handful of dirt in her hand and after she'd come a ways she threw it and then she turned around and went back. A large mound appeared there where she'd thrown the clump of dirt and they call it V&#xF8;ndildsh&#xF8;j. The farmhand brought the horn here to Hornslet. Before they just called it Sl&#xE6;t and they say that the church was built with the horn, that's why it's called Hornslet now. Now they call the mound H&#xE6;nildsh&#xF8;j, but it is V&#xE6;ndildsh&#xF8;j, because she turned around, and it lies in between Hornslet and the forest.</english_manuscript>

Han gav ogs&#xE5; holdt og tog guldb&#xE6;geret af hende, men i steden for at drikke slog han det bag over sig, og der kom nogle dripper p&#xE5; hesten, det tog hele hvien (huden) af b&#xE6;stet p&#xE5; de steder. Men hornet beholdt han i h&#xE5;nden og satte af, alt hvad han kunde, tv&#xE6;rt over alle agre, og hun satte bag efter og bad ham om at ride p&#xE5; det h&#xE5;r'e, og ikke p&#xE5; det b&#xE5;re, for hun skulde f&#xF8;lge vejen og kunde ikke rende p&#xE5; det pl&#xF6;jede. Hun rendte med en stor h&#xE5;ndfuld jord i h&#xE5;nden, og da hun kom et stykke hen, s&#xE5; kylte hun det, og s&#xE5; vendte hun sig og s&#xF6;gte tilbage. Der, hvor hun kylte den klump jord, blev en stor h&#xF6;j, og den kalder de Vendildsh&#xF6;j. Men karlen han leverede guldhornet her til Hornslet, og s&#xE5; sagde de, at kirken blev bygget op for det horn, derfor blev det nu kaldt Hornslet, f&#xF6;r kaldtes det blot Sl&#xE6;&#xE6;t. Nu kalder de h&#xF6;jen H&#xE6;nildsh&#xF6;j, men det er V&#xE6;ndildsh&#xF6;j, for det hun der vendte om, og den ligger her imellem Hornslet og skoven.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A farmhand came riding past a mound on Tendrup field once, they call it Hvonbj&#xE6;rg. Then a fine lady came running down from the mound and asked him to hold a glass while she poured him a snaps. He stopped and he took the gold cup from her but instead of drinking it, he threw it behind himself, and a couple of drops landed on the horse, it took all the skin off of the horse in those places. But he held onto the drinking horn and took off as fast as he could, right across the fields, and she set off after him and asked him to ride on the hard and not on the plowed fields because she had to go along the road and couldn&#x2019;t run on the plowed land. She ran with a large handful of dirt and after she&#x2019;d come a ways she threw it and then she turned around and went back. A large mound appeared there where she&#x2019;d thrown the clump of dirt and they call it Vendingsh&#xF8;j. But the farmhand brought the horn here to Hornslet and they say that the church was built with the horn, that&#x2019;s why it was called Hornslet, before that it was just called Sl&#xE6;&#xE6;t. Now they call the mound H&#xE6;nildsh&#xF8;j, but it is V&#xE6;ndildsh&#xF8;j, because that&#x2019;s where she turned around, and it lies in between Hornslet and the forest.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This unpublished story is probably not told by Kirsten Marie, and should not be considered part of her repertoire. The story was written in pencil in the field diaries, while all of Kirsten Marie's stories were written in ink. There is a line across the page below the preceding story, a mark that usually indicated that the collecting was complete.

     After leaving Kirsten Marie, Tang Kristensen continued on to Ryumg&#xE5;rd, where he began collecting from Inger Marie Ravn; those stories are also written in ink. This story appears in between the last of Kirsten Marie's stories and the first of Inger Marie's stories. It may have been told by a teacher Christensen whom Tang Kristensen mentioned in his memoirs, although that seems unlikely since he wrote he collected aspects of Mols folk speech from him, and not a short story about Vosn&#xE6;sg&#xE5;rd. Interestingly, Vosn&#xE6;sg&#xE5;rd figures in the biography of Ane Margrete Jensdatter.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie told a variant of this story in her first encounter with Tang Kristensen (KMP 1.52). This version of the story is more detailed than the first. The most significant change is the addition of the segment in which Rasmus consults with the local minister and is assured that he can consult the cunning man as long as he does it in the name of God. Rasmus's wife's response to his quiet return home is slightly different than the response in the first variant. Nevertheless, it serves the same release of narrative tension since Rasmus believes his wife has found "peace" in death, and not through a sudden and seemingly miraculous recovery. The earlier evaluative tag noting that Rasmus could not figure out how this had happened is missing from this variant.</annotation>

    <annotation>This record is a fragment of a story known as Jerusalems skomager (Jerusalem's cobbler) or Den evige J&#xF8;de (The Wandering Jew) (Hasan-Rokem and Dundes 1986). The legend tells of a cobbler who does not let Jesus lean against his house when he is on his way to Golgatha with the cross. The Jew, in turn, is condemned to wander the earth forever without rest except for one day each year: the night before Christmas (DS II G 88, G 89). Some variants of the story mention a provision for weekly rest (DS II G 87). If a plow was left outside on that night, the wandering Jew might rest on it, with the result that only weeds would grow wherever the plow plowed. This belief links the Wandering Jew to beliefs concerning the mare and its destructive tendencies (PJ 3.04).

     The story of the Wandering Jew first appeared in a pamphlet "Kurtze Beschreibung und Erz&#xE4;hlung von einem Juden mit Namen Ahasverus" [A Short Description and Story about a Jew named Ahasverus] printed in Leiden in 1602. It is unlikely that Kirsten Marie read the story in the pamphlet, even though the pamphlet was quickly translated into many languages, including Danish, soon after its publication. 

     The legend speaks to several important concerns. First, it supports the idea of mercy (and the concomitant strongly Lutheran notion that good deeds in this life are rewarded in the afterlife). The story also indirectly brings up the notion of wandering ethnic outsiders in the Danish landscape and their perceived threat to the economy of the farm. Accordingly, the story aligns well with Kirsten Marie's other stories about vagabonds (natm&#xE6;nd, tattere and rakkere). </annotation>

    <annotation>Omens can take various forms, most often mimicking the event that they portend (DS II J 306; DS I 248). Here, the men encounter the unusual regiment on the march at night. The threat of war--and the threat of conscription that rested solely on the peasant class--must have seemed almost constant up through the late 1860s. 

     Kirsten Marie makes an interesting distinction between the wars that Denmark was either engaged in or recovering from. Most notable were the Three Years War (Tre&#xE5;rskrigen) from 1848 to 1851 (F&#xF8;rste Slesvigske krig, First Schleswig war), and the war with Prussia in 1864 (Anden Slesvigske krig, Second Schleswig war). In 1807, Denmark entered into a catastrophic alliance with Napoleon in an attempt to maintain control of the kingdom and the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenborg. England declared war on Denmark in November of that year after they had bombarded Copenhagen and confiscated the Danish Navy in September and October. The end result of Denmark's alliance with Napoleon was the loss of Norway to Swedish rule, and the bankruptcy of the kingdom in 1814. 

      The reference to the war of 1807, which appears at the beginning of the published variant, but at the end of the manuscript variant, may either be Tang Kristensen's own annotation, or it may be a response to a direct query from Tang Kristensen.</annotation>

    <annotation>The threat witches pose to the economic well-being of the farm could not be more apparent than in this story. The farmhand attempts to bring home the harvest, only to have the witch tip his wagon. Oddly, the witch seems to be deriving no clear personal benefit from this--rather, she is simply destabilizing the cart and, by extension, the local economy (BJK 1.35).

     The farmhand's approach to dealing with the threat is straightforward and somewhat unusual. The threat of a beating brings the witch around. In other legends, a wide range of strategies are endorsed for dealing with witches, from calling cunning folk, the local minister, or the local magistrate, to dealing with them by oneself (Tangherlini 2000). 

     Witchcraft trials were no longer common in Denmark in the nineteenth century, and the accusation of witchcraft, although accompanied by local approbation, had little legal weight. It is worth noting that the woman who is described here as a witch is a poor, elderly woman. Accusations of witchcraft, when they were made, were frequently leveled at economically disenfranchised, single women. This status contrasts significantly with that of the cunning folk who, because of their community status, could sidestep such accusations (Tangherlini 2000).

     The name Ma' R&#xF8;gters is likely an abbreviation of the name of a person, Maren, who was married to or had been married to, a r&#xF8;gter, or stable hand.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stealing from the dead was a significant transgression, and the parish clerk compounds this by attempting to desecrate the corpse. Such treatment of the dead could provoke haunting (Pentik&#xE4;inen 1969). Minister's wives were also prone to haunting as numerous stories link them to the devil. 

     When the minister's wife awakens, the parish clerk believes that she has returned from the dead and, out of sheer terror, runs off. Since the wife has already been prepared for burial, the hired girls believe, as does the parish clerk, that the wife has come back as a haunt.

     A haunting would require the minister to conjure her and his interaction with her seems to be leading toward that. But her use of the Lord's name, in this case paradoxically as part of a curse, confirms that she is in fact alive. As such, the story amusingly undermines all of the characters' expectations, expectations that are informed by other stories of ghosts and conjuring.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>The minister's wife in Haslum was skin dead. She was to be placed in the church the night before she was to be buried, that was the custom at the time. Then the parish clerk sneaked in there with his lantern, and she had a gold ring on her little finger. He wanted to steal it but he couldn't get it off of her. He took his knife and wanted to cut it off with it. Then she came to life and said: "Ow, my little finger!" When the parish clerk heard that, he ran off, and they neither heard from him nor saw him again. Then she took the lantern and walked home. She saw that there was light in the kitchen, the hired girls were there busying about late that night, and she went over to the window and asked them to let her in. They ran in to the minister and said to him: "The lady was here."--"Oh children, that's not true," he said. "Yes, it is." So the minister went out there. "Oh dear papa let me in," "Oh dear mama go to your grave and lie down."--"No, I'm quite alive, let me in."--"Alas no," he said again, "go to your grave and lie down."--"For Christ's sake, let me in, I'm freezing to death." Now the minister let her in and she told him how she had come to life and what the parish clerk had been up to.

    <annotation>Poverty assistance was a major concern of farm owners during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and most legislative proposals emphasized the idea of care for the local poor. There were also debates over the care for pregnant wanderers such as the woman in this story. Many small communities expressed a concern that the care for poor wanderers (foreign poor) and their children would place an undue burden on local farmers (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940).

     The apparent wealth of the gypsies, who were clearly neither local nor poor, reflects the growing concern of a free rider problem in poverty assistance programs. The party the gypsies throw is further characterized as an ungodly affair, with dancing and gambling, both seen as vices by more conservative Danish Lutherans. Gambling was frequently mentioned in debates over legislation concerning support for the poor as one of the causes for a poverty that an individual had brought upon themselves. 

     Stories such as this no doubt supported the belief that some of the people who passed themselves off as poor were gaming the system. This belief led to some fairly stringent laws concerning repayment of support and limitations of the civil rights of the poor (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940).</annotation>

    <annotation>This tale is one of the few moderately positive accounts that Kirsten Marie tells about vagabonds and beggars. Her great grandparents are shown as compassionate and willing to go to great lengths to make Svine Karen comfortable. In turn, Svine Karen's piety so impresses Kirsten Marie's great grandparents that they decide to support her for the rest of her life. Voluntary support of the poor was a common feature of many of the proposals to reform the poverty assistance laws. Such proposals were popular in the rural areas for two reasons: they implied that the farmers were compassionate enough to support the local poor, and they did not require new taxes to support a widening welfare system. Of course, Kirsten Marie's parents' pledge of lifelong support for Svine Karen is easily honored, since she dies that night. The burial costs for Svine Karen would have been assumed by the local parish board as part of the public assistance to the poor.

     The name Svine Karen means "Pig Karen" and it would not be unusual to nickname a poor, wandering woman with a derogatory name such as this. 

     The published version of this account is connected with the published version of KMP 2.15. In the published, concatenated story, the current story appears second. The first part of the published version appears here in brackets.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories about the lindorm are widely attested in Danish tradition (DS II E 42, E 48). Supernatural threats to churches can also be read as threats to the community. The serpent that encircles the church prevents the people from using the church as a place to gather and to worship. Such an inversion of the normal social order is best counteracted by another inversion. Accordingly, the villagers raise a bull on food that makes little sense for a bull to eat. Eventually, it gains enough strength to retake the church.

     The story is reminiscent of stories in which steers or oxen are used to determine the place to build a church (KMP 1.18).</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is a retelling of a story Kirsten Marie had told in a previous meeting with Tang Kristensen (KMP 1.59). The first version includes a story abstract that details the river's demand for a sacrifice. In this version, the demand is incorporated into the orientation of the story. While the events take place at night in the first version, they take place early in the morning here. In both tellings, the woman takes much longer to drown than the man, and it is her protracted death that affects Kirsten Marie's uncle. 

   In the published version of the story, Tang Kristensen changed the position of some of the phrases in the story for no clear reason.</annotation>

Every now and then people could hear a voice that said, &#x201C;The time has come but not the man.&#x201D; One morning a couple of folk from &#xC6;beltoft came driving with fish, and it was really dark and murky, so they couldn&#x2019;t see where they had to drive. Then the water took them. The man died quickly, but the woman screamed pitifully for quite a while, she continued for nearly an entire hour. Her skirts had probably kept her up. Those who lived in Fl&#xF8;vstrup could hear her, since she was carried by the current down there, but they couldn&#x2019;t find her in time. When they found her body, they said that she&#x2019;d been stopped by the root of an alder. My mother&#x2019;s brother cried every time he told me that story.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This short account incorporates aspects of two of the best known tales about the mound dwellers, namely kidnapped by the mound dwellers (DS I 869, 898), and midwife to the mound dwellers (DS I 1098, 1122). 

     Unlike other stories that Kirsten Marie tells about elf kidnappings (KMP 1.60), the farmhand does nothing to return the girl to the human community. That the girl's nickname and the name of a mound are the same suggests that the girl has been fully incorporated into people's conception of the world of the mound dwellers.</annotation>

In this telling of the story, the name of the farmhand who provides the punchline has been changed to Ras (short for Rasmus) from Niels.

    <annotation>Children were often nursed until several years of age. Svine-Karen's offer to nurse the boy along with her own child may well have been in exchange for alms. Having been nursed by one of the local beggars clearly had a stigma attached to it, as the nursing crossed the otherwise clear class boundaries. The children's teasing makes use of a colloquial term for breasts. This story is published along with KMP 2.08. The second part of the published version appears here in brackets.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story is reminiscent of the series of stories Kirsten Marie tells about a man from Hadbjerg  (KMP 1.21-1.25). The story reveals the tension that existed between the countryside and the market towns. Farmers who visited the towns were often subjected to the mockery of the townspeople. This tension often spilled over into acrimonious political debate, first in the st&#xE6;nderforsamlinger (local assemblies) and later in the folketing (national assembly) over rights and obligations. In this story, the townspeople, in the guise of the cobbler and his journeyman, try to take advantage of Uglspil, playing on the double meaning of the word "sp&#xE6;kke." As a verb, the word means to stop a pair of boots but, as a noun, it means bacon. Consequently, they stop his boots with bacon. The smashed windows bring to the fore another tension, namely that within the crafts between master and journeyman. The journeyman literally has to pay for the fallout from his prank.

     Kirsten Marie makes no earlier reference to Uglspil, so the offhand mention of his name at the beginning of the story is a bit unusual.</annotation>

They couldn't pull themselves together to answer him.

Often people who chose to become tailors had no other options available either due to physical deformity or mental deficiencies.

    <annotation>Snow was one of the challenges facing both farmers and cotters, since it made transportation difficult and often meant that they would be forced to shovel snow. Most winter work was done inside or in the barns. It is unclear what is meant by binding hook to staff. It is also unclear to which appendix Tang Kristensen was referring with the annotation, "till&#xE6;g dele." It may be that it is a note to himself and not something Kirsten Marie said.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie's storytelling in this session begins with several amusing anecdotes about a foolish farm wife. The idea that a woman would not know how to cook sausages or wind yarn is absurd. Her daughter is equally foolish since making cheese is something that one would learn at a much earlier age than twenty.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A woman went into the neighbor woman's: "Can't you give me some good advice for my sausages, I've poked and prodded them and now they even creep (shrink) out of the smoke." Then the other woman says: "You've forgotten to put salt in them." "God I never would have thought of that!" The same woman came in another time to the neighbor woman. There was something that wasn't quite right for that woman. "Yeah," she says, "Would that you had as much trouble as the woman who has endless yarn." "Ha," says the other one, "then I could spin with one and then I'd have two." - "Thanks for the good advice, I've sat here lord knows and wound this yarn for two days and I couldn't find an end to it." The same woman had a daughter and the day she turned 20 she came to her mother's sister and said, "Moster, now I can make cheese..." "Well, then you are a clever little girl."</english_manuscript>

    <english_publication>A woman who wasn&#x2019;t terribly clever went over to the neighbor woman and said: &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t you give me some good advice for my sausages, I&#x2019;ve poked and prodded them but now they creep (shrink) even out of the smoke.&#x201D; Then the other woman answers: &#x201C;Haven&#x2019;t you forgotten to put salt in them?&#x201D; &#x201C;God I never would have remembered that!&#x201D; The same woman came in another time to the neighbor woman and something had gone bad for her that day.

    <annotation>Payment for hired hands was low on Danish farms. Because of a relative glut of young men and women looking for work, wages were poor and in many places consisted of little more than room, board, some cloth, and a nominal cash payment on a quarterly basis. Consequently, the hired hands paid close attention to the quality and quantity of food that they were served.

     The farmer's wife probably used grated cheese to save cheese since it would look to be much more than it actually was. The boy's amusing attempt to catch his cheese, throwing off his clogs so that he could run faster, has the desired effect, and he gets better food in the future.</annotation>

    <annotation>The published version offers a more readable version of the story, proposing a normalized reading of the boy's account of what was served at the banquet. It is unclear why Tang Kristensen changed the order of the sentences since the description of the foods served reveals the extent of the farmhand's speech impediment. An interest in poor pronunciation or unusually low intelligence informs some of Kirsen Marie's other stories as well (KMP 1.21-25 and 3.02). 

     Tang Kristensen added an explanation that sour cheese was served at banquets, presumably borrowing that explanation from Kirsten Marie's later explanation of banquet food (KMP 3.06).</annotation>

    <annotation>The foods served at this particular banquet would be considered unusual since they constitute everyday fare and not particularly exciting everyday fare at that. In this case, the poor food makes the celebration memorable. 

      Kirsten Marie had previously told a story about another banquet that was memorable, in that case because the hosts should not have been able to afford such an elaborate celebration (KMP 2.07). In both cases, she emphasizes the violation of expectations.

     In the published version, Tang Kristensen separated these descriptions and, in so doing, erased the continuity of the descriptions and the clear sense of expectations for banquets.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie turns her attention to the most elaborate banquets of all, namely wedding banquets. Here, she describes how the wedding banquet should be presented at its best. 

     The amusing repartee between the guests and the provisioner (skaffer) reflects the good-natured interaction that would take place between the guests and the hired help. This contrasts with another one of her stories where the man hired to act the fool at a banquet tricks the host out of his house (KMP 1.30).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>On the second day soup and sauce meat, rice porridge and fish. On the first day, they were served meat stew, and sow meat and roast and sister cakes (wheat cakes). When the provisioner brought the first platter of rice porridge in, they shot three shots outside of the windows, and he got so scared that he fell down right on the threshold into the main room and he complained bitterly. "That's too bad they shot just as I came." "You got scared," "Yes, and it wasn't without a reason." That was true. They fought bitterly over the bridegroom. The farmhands wanted to keep him; the men had him and they made like they fought trying to put the red cap on his head. At my great grandfather's wedding, it was so frenetic that sweat poured out of him that's how much the others had fought over him out there on the floor. There was a dance floor out there. He was to be danced from the party and it happened just when they were going to start dancing. They had three or four waiters who raced to the church so hard that the animals were about to collapse. There was also an inviter and she got a cup of grain each place she went. She was supposed to wash up and she was called the Slatopkok. They used a poor woman for that. There was also female cook. In our district the provisioner served, and then there were three waiters (smoner) and three hired girls (forgangspiger) who would help the provisioners by carrying the food in and serving it. They rode back home (from the church) just as fast and announced outside of all the windows that the bridal pair were now married and then back toward the bridal pair. In the old days, wedding banquets were held on Fridays and on Saturday there was a second day of banqueting. On Sunday every man and woman in the banquet party met and drove to church and back together and that was the third day of banqueting.

They really fought over him, because the young guys wanted to keep him, but the men wanted him, and then they wound up fighting while trying to put the red cap on his head.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie continues her descriptions of "how things ought to be done" at various life cycle festivals in her area. These descriptions may also be reminiscences, contrasting implicitly the manner in which things were currently done with her own idealized forms extrapolated from past experience and others' stories of memorable celebrations.</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie continues her discussion of food preparation but turns to a discussion of food that was eaten during wartime (KMP 3.15). Peas were often blended into bread dough to compensate for a lack of rye. 

     Given his presumed age, her grandmother's father's reference to "enemies" must hearken back to even before the Napoleonic wars, and the stationing of Spaniards and Frenchmen in Denmark (1808) or possibly the British invasion (1807, which was centered on Sj&#xE6;lland). Problematically, there were not any foreign troops stationed in Denmark during the mid to late eighteenth century. Kirsten Marie told other stories of Spanish soldiers in Denmark (KMP 1.13), but these troops were not enemies. They had been sent to assist Denmark in a planned attack on Sweden. There are no other occupations of Denmark that would correspond to her great grandmother's father's experiences. Another possibility is that the story is related to her own experiences either during the Three Years' War (1848-50) or the War of 1864. The soldiers could be German troops who were stationed throughout Jutland in 1848, or Prussian soldiers who occupied large parts of Jutland in 1864, nearly twenty years later.

     In the published version, Tang Kristensen corrected all the references to bread to "pea bread," rather than the somewhat confusing references to ale-bread, a porridge made by soaking bread in ale.</annotation>

    <annotation>Distilled spirits, known as br&#xE6;ndevin, were considered a staple of the rural diet. The distilling of spirits was a licensed undertaking limited to market towns. While licensed stills were common in towns, unlicensed rural stills were even more common (PJ 2.20). The unlicensed stills paid no taxes and therefore there was considerable pressure from the authorities to close them. In this short account of the controllers' visit, the farmwife confronts the problem in a time honored fashion: she uses her feminine charm and what amounts to a small bribe to distract the inspectors and keep the still operating. Other farmers apparently were not as lucky. 

     This story confirms the importance that Kirsten Marie's grandfather plays in her repertoire. The references are presumably to her maternal grandfather (Rasmus Christensen b. 1761), given other comments she makes about the sources of many of her stories (KMP 1.08, 1.10, 1.12, 1.29, 2.08 and 4.01).</annotation>

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie's short statement provides insight into the disappointments of a young girl growing up in a poor agrarian community. Presumably, she had asked for a new dress on a visit with her father to the local market town, maybe for her confirmation in 1842. Her father's harsh reaction, which Kirsten Marie then interprets, clearly stuck with her for her entire life.

While the troops in the wars of 1848 and of 1864 were certainly brave, they were often poorly equipped and poorly fed. The surprise in the soup, of course, is that there are no berries.

    <annotation>Kirsten Marie concludes her storytelling with an amusing tale. The punch line plays on stupidity and misunderstanding, two things that often feature prominently in Kirsten Marie's humorous tales (KMP 1.12, 1.14, 1.21, 1.21b, 1.23-25, 2.05-06, 2.14, 2.16-19, 3.02-4). Although the losing party is upset over his wife's gossip, he seems more upset that he was duped into believing that three crows, rather than just the one, had flown out of his friend's behind. Tang Kristensen has filled out the tale considerably in the published version.</annotation>

The neighbor wife comes back with her to see to him and then she goes back home, and she tells her husband that things were really wrong with the neighbor husband, because three crows had flown out of him that morning while he was out taking care of his needs. A little later, he goes over there himself, and the neighbor speaks up and asks him to pay the bet, because such and such had happened; he&#x2019;d convinced his wife that he was sick and that a crow had flown out of him and his wife had blabbed it on.

    <annotation>This and the following story (KMP 3.20) are included here because of a minor ambiguity in the field diaries. Although indications in the manuscript suggest that the two stories were told by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter, there are several factors that argue against this. First, and perhaps most importantly, the stories are extremely localized, and take place in Torsager, a town forty-six kilometers away from Kirsten Marie's residence in Hornslet. Torsager does not figure in any of Kirsten Marie's other stories. When Kirsten Marie mentions places, which she does often, those places tend to be either major market towns, such as &#xC5;rhus or Randers, or in the immediate vicinity of Rud and Nielstrup. Second, the index to Danske sagn lists  this story as being told by Teacher N. S&#xF8;rensen, Torsager, and the next story as being told by Jakob J&#xF6;rgensen from Torsager. There is, however, no mention of Teacher S&#xF8;rensen in Minder og Oplevelser. After Tang Kristensen left Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter on this, his penultimate visit to her, he took a train to Torsager (MO IV 5). It is likely that he met L&#xE6;rer N. S&#xF8;rensen on the train or at the train station, or perhaps at Provst Hansen's house, where he went soon after his arrival in Torsager (MO IV 5). 

     The index on the cover of the field diary volume is difficult to read, but it indicates that the stories following those told by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter were told by Kristiane Mogensdatter (6424b-6427b) and Elisabeth Poulsen (6427b-6429b). The names and page numbers on these volume covers are a later addition by Else Ramsy of the Danish Folklore Archive and are known to be inaccurate at times.</annotation>

    <annotation>Along with the previous story (KMP 3.19), this story is only included because of an ambiguity in the field diaries. The index to Danske Sagn lists this story as being told by Jakob J&#xF6;rgensen, Torsager, although markings in the field diaries suggest that the story was told by Kristiane Mogensdatter (see the annotation to KMP 3.19). In Minder og Oplevelser, Tang Kristensen remarks that, upon arrival in Torsager, he went to visit a grocer by the name J&#xF8;rgensen. It is likely that this story was told to him by the grocer, whose first name is not recorded in Minder og Oplevelser. It may be that his name was Jakob, or that the recording was accidentally attributed to another, older man in Torsager, from whom Tang Kristensen also collected. Recordings of the stories told by that Jakob J&#xF8;rgensen do not start until page 6429b in the field diaries.</annotation>

    <annotation>It is not surprising that Margrete starts off by singing a ballad, as Tang Kristensen often asked informants to sing ballads first, even at this late stage in his collecting career. It is also not surprising that she starts by singing one of the most popular and widely attested ballads in Danish tradition, "Redselille og Medevold" (DgF 271; BJK 1.08).

     Most variants of DgF 271 start with Rosenlille either weaving with her mother or dancing. Grundtivg does not comment on dice-playing which appears only in Margrete's variant. Her variant is first included in DgF in Dal and Pi&#xF8;'s addendum as DgF271&#xF8;*.

     Margrete refers to the two protagonists by common variants on the names. In the majority of other variants of this ballad, the woman's name is Redselille, a name that Grundtvig speculates is related to the Slavic name Regitse, used in the Danish Royal family starting in the twelfth century (DgF 5, 242).  Roselille, or a close permutation of that name, without the "n", is a common substitution, meaning "little rose." 

     The printed version adds a second strophe in verse 16, as well as verses 17 and 18. Verse 18 in the printed version appears as a variant form of verse 10. The printed version also includes verse 19, even though it appears at the very end of the ballad in the manuscript, set apart as a refrain. The main refrain is a bit unusual, as it is simply stylized laughing, a striking counterpoint to the otherwise tragic story of the ballad. It is unclear when (or even if) the second refrain is actually intended to replace the laughing refrain because Tang Kristensen recorded it at the end of the ballad, and made no annotation as to when it may have been performed.

     After verse 19 in the manuscript, Margrete mentions that the two lovers went off into the woods, and then she sings a verse that more likely belongs in her next ballad. Accordingly, Kristensen bracketed it, and then included it in the printed version of the next ballad, altering the name from "R. Allerkj." (abbreviated form of my beloved Rosenlille) to "stolten Gulenborg", the female protagonist of that ballad.

     Although the ballad is listed in the table of contents of JFm XI as ballad 46, it appears as 45 in the actual published collection. This problem with the numbering is due to the double numbering of "Hr. Esben og Sidselill" and "Tro som Guld" as ballad 41.

    <english_manuscript>1. Rosenlille and her dear mother they played
on the good gold dice

2. and listen Rosenlille my dear daughter
your cheeks are so pale

3. Well my cheeks have reason to be pale
I have so much to cut and sew

||: Haa haa haa haa haa :||

4. If you have so much to cut and sew
there are certainly others in this town
who can both cut and sew

5. And listen Rosenlille my dear daughter
milk springs from your breasts

6. It isn&#x2019;t milk, it just seems like that
it is the brown mead I drank yesterday

7. Mead is brown and milk is white
these two things are unlike each other

8. Now it isn&#x2019;t worth it to hide it from you any longer
little Ole has seduced me

9. And if little Ole has seduced you
Then you no longer have a dear mother in me

10. And him, he&#x2019;ll be hung so high
and you,  you&#x2019;ll be sent far away to foreign lands

11. Late at night when the dew fell
Rosenlille threw her blue cape on

12. She knocked on all the doors with her staff
Get up little Ole, open up for me

13. I haven&#x2019;t agreed to meet anyone
I don&#x2019;t let anyone into my room at night

14. Get up little Ole, let me in
I am Rosenlille, your beloved

15. And if you are Rosenlille my beloved
Even if I had to crawl, you would be let in

16. And when she came into the room

17. My mother is angry at both of us
she wants neither to see nor hear us

18. so gather all your gold and silver in a little box
while I saddle my gray steed

19. First he saddles the yellow and then the gray
he puts Rosenlille on the best one

And when they had come far out into the forest

[Now I hear my father&#x2019;s bridle posts clanging
Now I hear my father&#x2019;s gilded
they haven&#x2019;t been used since my mother&#x2019;s mother was a bride
and listen Rosenlille my dear
hold my horse and do not name my name.]

20. And when they had come far out into the forest
the farther they rode, the louder she cried

21. What, is your saddle too cramped
or is the road too long for you?

22. No, my saddle is not too cramped
nor is the road too long for me

23. In any case, should I get a priest for you
or would women and maids serve you better?

24. No you certainly shouldn&#x2019;t get a priest for me
but women and maids would serve me best.

25. Now we&#x2019;re so far out in Rosenvold
now I can&#x2019;t get women to serve you

26. But I will bind silk over my eyes
and then I will come in the place of the women

27. Before the man would learn of woman&#x2019;s need
no before that she&#x2019;d lie in Rosenvold dead

28. Little Ole was good and true to her
he got her water in her silver buckled shoes

29. And when he got to the stream to get water
then he heard the nightingale sing above him

30. Rosenlille lies in Rosenvold dead
with two small boys in her lap

31. And when he came back to Rosenvold
then he saw it was true, what the nightingale sang

32. Rosenlille lies in Rosenvold dead
with two small boys in her lap

33. Then he dug a grave so deep and so broad
and there he lay these three dead bodies

34. Then he drew his sword against a rock
and it injured his heart greatly

      In the published version of this ballad, Tang Kristensen added several verses that were actually performed as part of the previous ballad (AMJ 1.01). Apparently, during performance, Margrete repeated what she had sung earlier (probably by mistake), and Tang Kristensen, rather than record the lines again, simply noted "osv. Se foran" [etc. See above]. He also added the lyre, as in the manuscript it is unclear what it was that was gilded (there is no referent for the adjective). In the published version, Tang Kristensen also interpolates the second line of verse two, likely from another variant by another informant as the phrase does not appear in Margrete's repertoire. The wording of the postscript is slightly different in the printed version where the reference to Gulenborg being banished from the land is absent. Tang Kristensen turned the reference to banishment in the postscript into the missing line of verse 2 in the printed version, despite the fact that leaving the country of one's own free will is substantively different than being banished.

     The postscript does not appear in any of the other variants that Tang Kristensen collected, and appears to be an attempt by Margrete to anchor the ballad in the local landscape. Tang Kristensen interprets Klasholm in the manuscript's postscript as the castle "Klavsholm." Klavsholm (or Clausholm) lies midway between Randers and &#xC5;rhus in Jutland, and was built by Chancellor Conrad Reventlow in the 1690s. His daughter, Anna Sophie, was kidnapped from Clausholm by the love struck King Frederik IV in 1712, after she had been imprisoned in the castle by her mother. Frederik married her in 1721, after the death of his wife, Queen Louise. He subsequently had Anna Sophie crowned queen. When he died in 1730 at Odense Castle, she was banished to Clausholm, where she lived out her days as a widow, dying in 1743. 

     Rosenholm castle was built in the 1670s by Chancellor of the Realm J&#xF8;rgen Rosenkrantz, and the castle and its lands are still administered by the same family (18th generation). The family name figures prominently in Shakespeare's Hamlet, along with another Danish noble family name, Gyldenstierne, appearing in Shakespeare's play as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

     While the ballad may refer in an obscure fashion to the relationship between Anna Sophie and Frederik IV (1671-1730), there is no direct historical connection between their affair and Rosenholm castle or the Rosenkrantz family. More than likely, Margrete connected the ballad to stories she had heard about Frederik IV, Anna Sophie and Clausholm. Once she had narratively sent Gulenborg to Klavsholm, she needed to find an appropriate place to send Hr. Ridebold. Since Rosenholm was the grandest castle she knew, playing as it did a significant role in the economic landscape where she lived, she connected the protagonist of the ballad to it. Klavsholm would have been equally known to her. The connection between the castle and Frederik IV may have resonated with her own alleged connection to the royal court of Frederik VI, the great-grandson of Christian VI, who was the son of Frederik IV by a different mother.</annotation>

    <annotation>Even though Margrete suggests that the female figure in this story is a mound dweller, her description of her is much more in keeping with that of a ghost. The height of the female figure is unusual for mound dwellers, although the clothes that she is wearing are not (DS I 44). A ghost, rather than a mound dweller, would also align better with the fire wheel that Margrete sees in the second part of the story. When mound dwellers appear at night, they often approach people, and offer them a drink or entice them to dance (DS I 774 and 796).  Ghosts, however, often simply appear, causing profound fear (Pentika&#xEF;nen 1969).</annotation>

    <annotation>Boels-Maren appears to be the name of a mound dweller, given the close connection of her name to the local mound Boelsh&#xF8;j. Danish nicknames often include place name referents. The boy has mistaken the mound dweller for a human, a common occurrence in variants of this story (DS I 270). In some variants, the story revolves around the discovery that the seemingly human figure is actually a mound dweller (DS I 266). In this variant, the interaction between the boy and the girl is one between peers as both of them doing chores for their respective employers. 

     There are numerous other stories where humans encounter mound dwellers on their way to or from birth celebrations or baking. In this case, the little girl is bringing food to the presumably sick or old Boels-Maren from a feast celebrating the birth of another mound dweller, as "barselmad" is glossed by Feilberg as "the food sent from a birth celebration to sick people in town" (Feilberg 1910, vol. 1, 52). "Barselmad" or birth food can, according to Feilberg, also refer food given to a woman who is pregnant or has just given birth ("food for a birth celebration or for a woman who has just given birth"). If one reads the term in this latter manner, then Boels-Maren is possibly a kidnapped human who has just given birth inside the mound. The story succinctly confirms the parallel nature of mound dwellers' society and human society. In other stories of mound dwellers' births, a human is kidnapped by the mound dwellers to assist in the birth (DS I 1098 and 1122 ).</annotation>

    <annotation>In this short and somewhat disjointed legend, the hired boy seeks out the mound dweller. His motivation for doing so is missing in Margrete's variant. One also needs to interpolate a missing conversation between the boy and the mound dweller to understand the seemingly obscure reference to Tordenf&#xE5;er (Thunder father) and M&#xFC;tter Maria (mother Mary). In other variants of this legend, the boy has either gone out to ask the mound dweller to stand as godfather for the farmer's child--an interesting reversal of the mound dweller asking a farmer's wife to act as midwife to his wife--or to trick the mound dweller into giving a large monetary gift to celebrate the birth of the child--again, a parallel to the midwife legends (DS I 1414). In other variants of this legend, the mound dweller provides a substantial monetary gift, but begs off attending the celebration because the guests will include religious figures (the mother Mary, and in most cases the Lord and St. Peter), and the music will be drumming (referred to in this case as "Tordenf&#xE5;er" (Thunder father) by the mound man) (DS I 1413). 

     The mound dweller apparently assists the hired hand in his work in this story, and thus takes on some aspects of the helpful nisse. Like a nisse, the mound dweller guarantees success for the farm, but also shows a distinct loyalty to the farmhand and the farm. The legend affirms the strong economic connection between the farmers and supernatural beings that informs many of Margrete's legends.</annotation>

    <annotation>The three legends Margrete tells here are closely related and she moves smoothly from one account to the next. Although Margrete stays in the realm of the supernatural, she turns her attention to the wise minister, Pastor Kattrup. In general, the abilities of the wise minister  align with those of the more secular cunning man or cunning woman. Although there is a tendency to translate "klog" as "wise," these "wise folk" are more commonly referred to as "cunning folk" or "folk healers" in Anglo-American tradition. The conflict between cunning folk and wise ministers appears frequently in Danish legends, and points toward the tension between the secular and the ecclesiastic in late nineteenth century Denmark (DS VII 176).

     In the first account, the emphasis is on the wise minister's ability to counteract the economic threat of theft by revealing the location of a stolen object (showing again) or otherwise revealing the identity of a thief (KMP 1.56, 1.57) . The minister's powers fail when scissors are put to the canvas, reflecting the power of metal and knives to interfere with the supernatural.

     The second legend is widely attested in Danish tradition (DS IV 1120, IV 1121). Kathleen Stokker interprets Norwegian variants of the legend as related to the power of the Lutheran minister and the role of confession in Lutheran practice (Stokker 1989). The story certainly plays on the power of the minister to counteract the intrusion of the otherworldly into the community. One of the minister's emblems of power is his book. In some variants of the legend, the book is specified as the Black Book, in others, the Bible (DS V 700) and parallels the cunning folk's use of the Cyprianus. The black book is often used in conjuring ghosts. 

     The hapless farmhand who has little business walking about in the liminal space of the cemetery at night is treated as a ghost, even after he reveals himself to be human. He is summarily conjured into the ground and his death. The conflation of Satan and ghosts reflects the Lutheran theological accommodation to the widespread popular belief in ghosts (Tangherlini 1999). The minister's seeming powerlessness to stop the conjuring reveals a chink in his armor: either he is powerless in the face of these greater forces or he proffers a punishment out of all proportion to the farmhand's offense. In either case, the implications are not reassuring. 

     The final story also explores the power of the minister, here to reanimate the dead. Blame for the man's suicide is attributed to the wife and the story can thus be read as a negative commentary on marriage. Up through the nineteenth century, people were laid out on straw after death until burial two to three days later. The minister's correspondence with Copenhagen reveals the role of central authorities in local affairs, a matter of great political debate in the last decades of the nineteenth century (N&#xF8;rr 1994).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Pastor Katrup in Skj&#xF8;dstrup could show again. He asked his wife if his canvas had disappeared. Went out and asked her girls about it. They denied it the first time, they thought that the farmhand had hidden it on them. Then they went out and asked the farmhand about it, but the farmhand said no, he hadn't hidden it. Had to admit it and the Lady went in to Kattrup and told him it was gone. Yes, he knew that was the case, "but you could have told me the first time, then I could have gotten it back for you, but now there's a scissors at it, and they're cutting it into pieces, so I can't show it back. But this fall he'll come and steal apples, so we'll catch him sure enough. I know that he'll come and steal from the tree right in front of the garden room, then my son Jokum will have the gun loaded with buckshot." He came, too, and he sought out the apple tree just as the minister had said. The son was up in the garden room and when the other one was a good ways up and had gotten hold of some apples, he shot his legs full of buckshot and his toes were blown off. Since the minister could do so much magic, the neighborhood youngsters wanted his farmhand to scare him in the church. He went up to the church every night and sat in silent prayer, and when he was on his way back, the farmhand stood stiff in front of him. "If it's a person, then answer, if it's Satan, then yield!" But he didn't answer. Then the minister took his book, flung it open and began to read. Now the farmhand noticed that he was sinking, and he'd sunk down above his ankles before he answered. Then the minister said, "I can't do anything, now that you've sunk in above the joint, if you'd answered before, then I could have saved you." One time, he told his people that a man who'd hung himself was probably in Heaven. It was his wife who'd caused it, he was sure about that. Then he took two men with him and they went to the man, while he was lying on straw, and asked him three questions. He answered them well enough. The men were quite surprised by that. Then he went in to the wife and said, "Well, I wish you and I were as certain about Heaven as he is, he's definitely going into consecrated ground." It was the custom that people who had killed themselves were put into holes or the like. "But we sure aren't going to do that to him." Then the minister wrote to Copenhagen and got permission for the body to be placed in the cemetery.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Pastor Kattrup i Skj&#xF6;dstrup spurgte hans kone, om hendes l&#xE6;rred, der l&#xE5; p&#xE5; bleg, var ikke henne. Hun gik ud og spurgte pigerne om det. De n&#xE6;gtede det f&#xF8;rste gang, for de mente, at karlene havde fj&#xE6;ld det for dem. S&#xE5; gik de ud og spurgte karlene om det, men de sagde nej, de havde ikke fj&#xE6;ld noget. S&#xE5; m&#xE5;tte pigerne til at bekjende, at det ogs&#xE5; var henne, og fruen gik ind til Kattrup og fortalte det. Ja, han vidste det godt, "men du kunde have sagt mig det f&#xF8;rste gang, da kunde jeg have skaffet dig det, men nu er der saks p&#xE5; det, og de er ude at klippe det i stykker, s&#xE5; kan jeg ikke vise det tilbage. Men i efter&#xE5;ret kommer tyven og vil stj&#xE6;le &#xE6;bler, s&#xE5; skal vi nok f&#xE5; ham fanget. Jeg v&#xE9;d, at han kommer og vil stj&#xE6;le i den abild lige for havestuen, s&#xE5; skal Jokum, min s&#xF6;n, have b&#xF8;ssen ladet med hagl." Tyven kom ogs&#xE5;, og han s&#xF6;gte abilden, som pr&#xE6;sten sagde. S&#xF6;nnen var oppe i havestuen, og da den anden var kommen godt op og havde f&#xE5;et nogle &#xE6;bler, sk&#xF8;d Jokum hans ben fulde af hagl, s&#xE5; t&#xE6;erne gik af ham.
     Ved det pr&#xE6;sten kunde gj&#xF8;re s&#xE5; mange kunster, vilde ungdommen have hans karl til at r&#xE6;de ham i kirken. Pr&#xE6;sten gik op til kirken hver aften og satte sig i hans stol, og da han gik tilbage, stod karlen stivt for ham. "Er det folk, s&#xE5; svar, er det Satan, s&#xE5; sig!" Men karlen gav intet svar. S&#xE5; tog pr&#xE6;sten hans bog og kastede op og begyndte at l&#xE6;se. Nu m&#xE6;rkede karlen, han sak, og han var sukken over fodleddet, inden han svarte. Da sagde pr&#xE6;sten: "Nu kan jeg ikke redde dig, nu du er kommen over leddet. Havde du snakket f&#xF6;r, kunde jeg have frelst dig".
     En gang sagde han til hans folk, at Lars Nielsen, der havde h&#xE6;ngt sig, var vis p&#xE5; Himmerig, det var hans kone, der havde voldt det, det var han vis p&#xE5;. S&#xE5; tog han to m&#xE6;nd med sig og gik til den d&#xF8;de, da han l&#xE5; p&#xE5; str&#xE5;, og gav ham tre sp&#xF6;rgsm&#xE5;l. Han svarede godt nok p&#xE5; dem, og m&#xE6;ndene undrede dem over det. S&#xE5; gik han ind til konen og sagde: "Ja, gid dig og mig var s&#xE5; sikker p&#xE5; Himmerig som han, han skal sandelig i viet jord." Det var jo skikken, at dem, der tog sig selv af dage, de skulde puttes ned i huller og anstalter. "Men det skal han sandelig ikke blive gjort ved." S&#xE5; skrev pr&#xE6;sten til Kj&#xF6;benhavn og fik tilladelse til, at liget m&#xE5;tte komme i kirkeg&#xE5;rden.
     Han gik hver eneste aften op p&#xE5; kirkeg&#xE5;rden og ind i kirken. Hans datter Kristiane fulgte med ham til kirken, men hun vilde ikke med derind. Han var meget hj&#xE6;lpel&#xF8;s, og derfor fulgte hun ham ogs&#xE5; til kirken hver s&#xF8;ndag.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Pastor Kattrup in Skj&#xF8;dstrup asked his wife if her canvas that was being bleached hadn&#x2019;t disappeared. She went out and asked the girls about it. They denied it the first time, because they thought that the farmhands had hidden it on them. Then they went and asked the farmhands about it, but they said no, they hadn&#x2019;t hidden anything. Then the girls had to admit that it had disappeared and the lady went in to Kattrup and told him. Yes, he knew that was the case, &#x201C;but you could have told me the first time, then I could have gotten it back for you, but now there&#x2019;s a scissors at it, and they&#x2019;re cutting it into pieces, so I can&#x2019;t show it back. But this fall the thief will come and steal apples, so we&#x2019;ll catch him sure enough. I know that he&#x2019;ll come and steal from the tree right in front of the garden room, then my son Jokum will have the gun loaded with buckshot.&#x201D; The thief came, too, and he sought out the tree as the minister had said. The son was up in the garden room and when the other one was a good ways up and had gotten hold of some apples, Jokum shot his legs full of buckshot and his toes were blown off. 
     Since the minister could do so much magic, the neighborhood youngsters wanted his farmhand to scare him in the church. The minister went up to the church every night and sat in his chair, and when he was on his way back, the farmhand stood stiff in front of him. &#x201C;If it&#x2019;s a person, then answer, if it&#x2019;s Satan, then say so!&#x201D; But the farmhand didn&#x2019;t answer. Then the minister took his book, flung it open and began to read. Now the farmhand noticed that he was sinking, and he&#x2019;d sunk down above his ankles before he answered. Then the minister said, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t save you now, now that you&#x2019;ve sunk in above the joint. If you&#x2019;d spoken before, then I could have saved you.&#x201D;
     One time, he told his people that Lars Nielsen, who&#x2019;d hung himself, was likely in Heaven. It was his wife who&#x2019;d caused it, he was sure about that. Then he took two men with him and they went to the dead one, when he was lying on straw, and asked him three questions. He answered them well enough and the men were quite surprised by that. Then he went in to the wife and said, &#x201C;Well, I wish you and I were as certain about Heaven as he is, he&#x2019;s definitely going into consecrated ground.&#x201D; It was the custom that people who had killed themselves were put into holes or the like. &#x201C;But we sure aren&#x2019;t going to do that to him.&#x201D; Then the minister wrote to Copenhagen and got permission for the body to be placed in the cemetery.
     Every night, he walked up in the cemetery and into the church. His daughter Kristiane followed with him to the church, but she wouldn&#x2019;t go in there. He was quite helpless and therefore she always accompanied him to church every Sunday.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This story is missing from the fair copy collection (&#xC6;ventyr renskrift) collection at the Danish folklore archives, and has not been published elsewhere. The story borders on the obscene, and may have been deemed unsuitable for publication. The story has elements common to tales classified as ATU 1358A, "Hidden Lover Buys Freedom from Discoverer", and B, "Husband Carries Off Box Containing Hidden Lover", and ATU 1359, "Husband Outwits Adulteress and Lover".

     The wife and minister's dalliance is ultimately revealed to the entire congregation, echoing in part the condemnation of the wife in the preceding legend (AMJ 1.06). Ultimately, balance is restored in the couple's marriage and their relationship to the minister and the church.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a minister who gave the most delightful sermons. Then there was a woman, who was so pretty and she liked to listen to him so much and went to church every Sunday and he wanted her just as much. He wanted so often to chat with her. It happened one Sunday that he got to talking with her and he wanted to know where she lived. He preferred to visit her when her husband wasn't home. She said he wouldn't be home on Saturday, he had to go to Copenhagen. So the minister came to visit her then. Believed that her husband wouldn't come home during the night, so the minister stayed there that night. But then it happened that her husband came home anyway. And they were about to go to bed together and the minister was getting undressed. Then her husband came driving in. Where should I hide? Well, out into their hired girl's room, since she wasn't home. She let him in there and when her husband came in, he asked if they'd gotten ready to brew tomorrow. No they weren't prepared because they hadn't milled any malt or anything else. Well, then go out and mill the malt, she and the hired girl could certainly do that that evening. She didn't dare say that she'd given the hired girl the night off. The husband goes out to the girl's room and says that she has to get up and help mill malt, and it was dark. The minister wakes up and puts on the girl's clothes. Then he got up and went and helped the wife mill malt. Then he went back into the girl's room, he was supposed to be the girl. Then the night wore on and he decided that he'd better get home. Now the wife goes to church the next day again. That's a terrible husband you have, is he always like that to you, if so then I really feel for you. Can't you say for certain when he is going to be away again. Then she wrote to the minister that it was certain that he would be away the next Saturday, quite far away. Then the minister came again and visited the woman. Got food and drink and was well taken care of, and well into the night they got ready to go to bed together, they figured that he wouldn't be coming back again. Took off their clothes, and he came driving into the farmyard again, just like the first time didn't know any place for him to hide other than a nook in the hen house, she didn't think he'd go there, otherwise he tended to look in all the nooks. And the husband came in and she asked if he wanted something for dinner and he said he wanted roast chicken. Could not go out to the hen house tonight. That was strange. Well, he wanted that, and so he went out to the hen house. When he opened the door, the minister came running out, but he didn't know who it was. Came in and said he had no idea what kind of spectacle there was out there in the hen house, but he couldn't get any hens. The third Sunday, comes once more to church. That's quite a frightened husband you have. Yes, he's always like that, you can't count on him. But now next Saturday, he is definitely going to be gone, so we can talk about everything then. Minister again. Were done and had food and drink to bed. All the clothes off and were about to go to bed and the husband came driving home again. Had no idea what to do. But there was a big feather barrel sitting right there, and she put the lid on a bit. When the husband came in. So, how are you, have you gotten those feathers together. I need to go off again tomorrow, out with the two feather barrels and have them nailed shut tonight. He came in and nailed the barrels shut and had them brought out onto the dung heap since they had to be ready to be loaded up the next day. So he loaded them like that so that he could just get to the church, because he knew quite well what was in the barrel, he and his wife had talked about it with each other. Came right to the church and people were there. Knocked the barrel off and it broke open. And the church folk got scared, they thought that it was the Devil who came out of the barrel. But the minister hurried up and went in and got into other clothes and came and held his sermon. The next Sunday, the husband wanted to go to church too, hadn't been there for quite a while, wanted to go in the minister's clothes, they were lying out there. The minister quite recognized the husband. He had no idea how he was going to get away with it, was probably going to say something about it in the sermon how it had come about. He mentioned that he had gone to a place where they had undressed him and kept his clothes, but now he hoped that it was a gift to both the husband and wife, that they could be more in agreement. He could see that they accompanied each other to church. Since then the wife could go to see the minister, and since then the man accompanied his wife to church.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Economic concerns play a significant role in this active masculine fairy tale since payment for the apprenticeships and the boy's prowess with his crafts are all foregrounded. Unlike many other variants of ATU 517, "The Boy Who Understands the Language of Birds", the boy protagonist seems to foster no ill-will towards his parents.

     Holbek suggests that figures such as the princess should be read more as the daughter of a wealthy farmer than an actual princess, and the daughter here seems to confirm that. The boy's parents are not poor, and additions to the story in the fair copy emphasize that. One cannot help but notice the arrangements that the boy makes for his parents, bringing them to the castle rather than leaving them in their advancing years to fend for themselves. Such an arrangement would have had great appeal to a pensioner like Margrete. The parents' donation of their possessions to the poor is an unusually progressive position for a fairy tale, and should be read in the context of the ongoing debate over the care of the poor in rural communities.

     Although the fair copy is not missing from the collection at the Danish folklore archives, the story has never been published. The fair copy follows the text of the manuscript closely, but smooths out the language.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Two old people just one son. Thought he was tired of staying home all the time and said that he wanted to start an apprenticeship. Which craft? Well, cobbling. Good to get some shoes. Drove over there and give 400 daler to teach him that and to be good to him. Became quite good at it. Then the cobbler said to him, he couldn't teach him any more, best that he wrote to his parents that they should come and get him. He should write instead that he was a fool and couldn't learn anything and didn't want to anymore anyway. Then the cobbler had to write that, and then they came and got him. They doubted it since he had no desire to stay at home the whole time. Got home. It doesn't matter, you're welcome to stay at home with us, we've got plenty of things for you to do. Stayed at home for a little while, asks if he can't start learning another craft (start another apprenticeship). Sure, which craft. Said goldsmith because that was clean work. Thought that was a very good idea. Brought him to a goldsmith and asked how much he wanted. 400 Daler. Teach him well, had one apprenticeship before, but didn't want to do it. Yes, would do his best. Was there for a while and now was more skilled than the Master. Ready to do things that the Master couldn't. Better write home .... No, not like that, rather that he didn't have any desire etc. Home and was there a while. Start one more apprenticeship. ... Off to learn the speech of birds. Thought that was strange, but off they went. Came to the man who could speak to the birds, and he got 400 daler for that. Clever and could every language and understand every bird. Wanted to write home that he was so clever. Yes, he may, then they'd have the pleasure of that. Was home for a while. The next day a bird comes and sings. What did it say, said his mother. It's singing that I am going to go traveling soon. What are you going to travel for? I don't know, it's singing about that now. Then another bird came and sang. He was going to go out traveling because there was so much good waiting for him. The mother didn't like this very much. A third bird came. What is that one singing? It's singing that I will come home looking so fine that you won't recognize me, and that you will take your silver platter and let me wash myself in it. That will never happen, I would never let you wash yourself in my silver platter. Well, I am going to go now, because that's what the birds are singing about. Went off and first to a cobbler nearby, who worked for the people at the castle. A request for the cobbler came from the Princess asking if they could sew (make) her a shoe identical to the one she had, she'd tossed one of her shoes away. The cobbler thought he couldn't sew (make) such a fine one. But he'd gotten a new journeyman, it could be that he could make one that nice. Came home to the journeyman. Said he'd often done such fine work. It would be finished the next day. And so it was a deal. The cobbler went and looked in at the door. Didn't think he was doing anything. The next day it was finished. Down to the princess. Could she perhaps see this journeyman. She wanted him. He didn't want to yet, he had also learned to be a goldsmith. Wanted to go to a goldsmith. Same kind of message came about a gold ring, make the finest one they could. Was afraid that he couldn't make one as shiny. But had a journeyman. Ask him about that. Sure, could certainly make the ring and everything else. The goldsmith looks in at the door but didn't think he was doing much with it. The next morning. Yes, it has been done for quite a while. Goes along to the princess. The shiniest ring she had ever had, would the journeyman please come. Down there. Talked. Don't you want me. Yes, because she really wanted to and they called the king to them. They could certainly have each other and then have the kingdom. So they got each other. Want to come home and meet my parents. Hitched up (the horses) and started driving. When they got there, the mother and father were sitting inside. Jesus Christ, what kind of fine strangers have arrived? What should we do with them? The rooms are not so nice. Oh, the rooms are good enough, said the husband, let them come in. Would they like something to eat. Sure. Could they stay the night. Oh my goodness, we only have a guest room. Would they be happy to stay there. Very pleased, would love to stay more than anything. Got up early and went and looked to see if they were going to get up anytime soon. Into their clothes, put some water in their silver platter. In to eat. Listen you two old people, don't you have any children. Oh, dear god, we have a single son, had many apprenticeships and traveled off. Can you recognize him. Yes, he has a birthmark on his left arm, a red spot, if I see it, then I'll recognize him. Unbuttoned and showed her the mark. Oh dear god, is this my son. Can you see now, that you've taken the platter that the birds sang about and I've had a fortunate journey. They talked about going with them. Yes, what should we do with the things we have. You can give them to the poor. Yes, we'll do that for our son. They also learned that he was quite good at all his crafts.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var to gamle Folk, og de havde kun en S&#xF8;n. Nu tykte han, at han var kjed af at gaa hjemme hele Tiden, og saa forlangte han at komme i L&#xE6;re. &#x201D;Hvad L&#xE6;re kan du da have Lyst til at komme i?&#x201D; siger Faderen. Ja, han vilde da helst v&#xE6;re Skomager, for det var da godt at faa noget godt Skot&#xF8;j. De gamle var velstaaende Folk, og de kj&#xF8;rer saa hen til en Skomager og akkorderer med ham om at tage S&#xF8;nnen i L&#xE6;re. De skulde give ham 400 Daler for det, og saa skulde han v&#xE6;re god ved ham. Han kommer saa i L&#xE6;re, det gj&#xF8;r S&#xF8;nnen, og han blev en meget dygtig Skomager. Saa siger Skomageren til ham: &#x201D;Nu kan a ikke l&#xE6;re dig mere, nu er det bedst, a skriver hjem til dine For&#xE6;ldre, de kan komme og hente dig.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Nej, du skal skrive, a er et Doggerhoved, der ikke kan l&#xE6;re noget, og a har heller ingen Lyst til l&#xE6;ngere.&#x201D; Skomageren maatte saa ogsaa skrive det, og For&#xE6;ldrene maatte hen og hente ham. Ja, de tvivlede jo godt paa at han ingen Lyst havde til det, for han havde jo gaaet hjemme hele Tiden. Saa kommer S&#xF8;nnen altsaa hjem igjen. &#x201D;Det gj&#xF8;r jo ikke noget,&#x201D; sagde de, &#x201D;at du ikke blev Skomager, for du kan jo gj&#xE6;rne blive ved at gaa hjemme ved os, vi har jo nok at gj&#xF8;re imod dig med.&#x201D; Da han havde saa gaaet hjemme en bitte Tid, saa sp&#xF8;rger han, om han maa ikke komme i &#xE9;n L&#xE6;re til. &#x201D;Ja, hvad L&#xE6;re vil du saa i?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201D;I Guldsmedl&#xE6;re,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;for det er da et rent Arbejde, og det tykker a rigtig godt om.&#x201D; Ja, For&#xE6;ldrene havde heller ikke noget imod det, og saa tager de hen til en Guldsmed og sp&#xF8;rger om, hvad han vilde have at l&#xE6;re deres S&#xF8;n Professionen. Ja, han vilde have 400 Daler. &#x201D;Saa skal du ogsaa l&#xE6;re ham godt, han har v&#xE6;ret i &#xE9;n L&#xE6;re f&#xF8;r, men den havde han ikke Lyst til.&#x201D; Det lovede han, og saa vilde de ogsaa godt give de Penge. Han kommer saa til Guldsmeden og er der et Stykke Tid, og han l&#xE6;rte saa godt, at han nu var bleven villere end Mesteren, og var rede til at gj&#xF8;re det, som Mesteren ikke kunde. Saa siger Guldsmeden: &#x201D;Nu maa a hellere skrive hjem til dine For&#xE6;ldre, at de kan komme og hente dig, for nu er du udl&#xE6;rt.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201D;Nej, saadan skal du ikke skrive, du skal skrive, te a har ingen Lyst til at v&#xE6;re Guldsmed, og a er et Doggerhoved, der ikke kan l&#xE6;re noget.&#x201D; Ja, det tykte han jo ikke, men det blev til sidst saadan, at Karlen fik ham til at skrive saadan. For&#xE6;ldrene kom saa efter ham, og de sagde: &#x201D;Ja, vi t&#xE6;nkte det nok, han har v&#xE6;ret i &#xE9;n L&#xE6;re f&#xF8;r, og det kunde ikke blive til noget. Men han kan ogsaa godt blive ved at gaa hjemme ved os, for vi har jo nok.&#x201D; Han kom saa hjem og gik der en Tid. Saa siger han: &#x201D;A troer, a vil ud i en L&#xE6;re til, nu har a faaet Lyst til at komme hen og l&#xE6;re Fuglesproget.&#x201D; De tykte jo, det var s&#xE6;rt, men han var vant til at faa hans Vilje, og han skulde af Sted. Saa tager Faderen med ham hen til den Mand, der kunde Fuglesproget, og han akkorderer med ham om at l&#xE6;re S&#xF8;nnen og skulde have 400 Daler for det. &#x201D;Men saa kommer du ogsaa til at l&#xE6;re ham godt, for nu har han v&#xE6;ret i L&#xE6;re to Gange, og det er ikke bleven til noget.&#x201D; Ja, det skulde han nok, og S&#xF8;nnen kommer i L&#xE6;re og bliver dygtig til Sproget, saa han kunde nu forstaa hver Fugl. Da han har v&#xE6;ret der en Tid, saa siger Mesteren: &#x201D;Ja, nu vil a skrive hjem til dine For&#xE6;ldre, te nu er du dygtig nok, og nu kan de komme og hente dig.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det maa du godt,&#x201D; siger Karlen, &#x201D;saa faar de da den Forn&#xF8;jelse.&#x201D; Han kommer saa hjem igjen, og da han har v&#xE6;ret hjemme en lille Tid, saa kommer der en Dag en Fugl og sidder og synger. &#x201D;Hvad er det, den synger?&#x201D; siger Konen. &#x201D;Den synger, te a skal snart til at ud og rejse.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Hvad skal du ud at rejse efter?&#x201D; &#x201D;Ja, det v&#xE9;d a ikke, den synger nu saadan.&#x201D; Saa kom der en anden Fugl, og den sang ogsaa, han skulde ud at rejse, for der var saa meget godt i Vente for ham. Dether tykte Moderen ikke om. Saa kom der en tredje Fugl og sang. &#x201D;Hvad er det saa, den synger?&#x201D; siger Moderen. &#x201D;Den synger, te a skal komme hjem i saadan en Finhed, saa I kan ikke kjende mig, og I skal tage jert S&#xF8;lvfad og lade mig vaske mig i.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Det skal nu aldrig ske, te a skal tage mit S&#xF8;lvfad og lade dig vaske dig i,&#x201D; siger Moderen. &#x201D;Ja, nu skal a til at afsted,&#x201D; siger S&#xF8;nnen, &#x201D;for det synger Fuglene jo hele Tiden om,&#x201D; og saa gav han sig ogsaa paa Rejsen. F&#xF8;rst kom han til en Skomager, der boede t&#xE6;t ved Slottet og arbejdede for de Kongelige. I det samme kommer der Bud fra Prinsessen, at hun havde kastet hendes ene Sko hen, og nu vilde hun have Skomageren til at sy Magen til den. Men han tykte ikke, han kunde sy saa p&#xE6;n en &#xE9;n, for han var jo oppe paa Slottet at se den. Men saa kommer han lige i Tanker om, han havde faaet en ny Svend, det kunde v&#xE6;re, han kunde v&#xE6;re nok saa dygtig. Han gaar saa hjem til Svenden og snakker med ham om det. &#x201D;Ja, den kan a sagt sy,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;saa fint Arbejde har a lavet saa tit.&#x201D; Ja, den skulde v&#xE6;re f&#xE6;rdig til Andendagen. &#x201D;Det kan den sagt blive,&#x201D; siger han. Han kommer saa paa V&#xE6;rkstedet og skal til at sy denher Sko, og Skomageren gik og kikkede ind ad D&#xF8;ren af og til, han tykte ikke, han bestilte noget. Men anden Morgen var den f&#xE6;rdig, og Skomageren gaar saa ned paa Slottet til Prinsessen med den. Da hun ser den, siger hun, om hun maatte ikke faa den Svend at se. Skomageren gaar saa hjem og siger, at Prinsessen vilde tale med ham. Han kommer ogsaa derned, og da hun ser ham, saa vil hun have ham. Men det havde han ikke Lyst til endnu. Han vilde nu hen til en Guldsmed, for han havde ogsaa l&#xE6;rt den Profession. Saa kommer der lige saadan Bud til den Guldsmed fra Prinsessen, om han vilde lave hende en Guldfingerring, og den skulde laves det p&#xE6;neste, han kunde. Der blev jo sendt Bud efter ham, men han sagde, at han var r&#xE6;d for, han kunde ikke lave &#xE9;n saa brilliant, som hun &#xF8;nskede den. Men han havde lige faaet en ny Svend, og han vilde sp&#xF8;rge ham om det, om han kunde ikke lave den, for han var kanske nok saa dygtig. Han kommer saa hjem og taler til ham om det. &#x201D;Jo, den kan a sagtens lave,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;a kan lave baade Ringe og alting.&#x201D; Den skulde v&#xE6;re f&#xE6;rdig Andendagen, og nu skal han til at smede paa den. Guldsmeden gaar jo og kikker til det ind ad D&#xF8;ren, men han tykte ikke ret, han gjorde noget ved det. Saa anden Dags Morgen kommer han jo derind og sp&#xF8;rger til det. &#x201D;Ja, den har v&#xE6;ret f&#xE6;rdig l&#xE6;nge,&#x201D; siger Svenden, og saa gaar Guldsmeden ned til Prinsessen med den. Det var den brillianteste Ring, hun havde haft nogen Tider, om den Svend vilde ikke komme ned til hende, hun havde Lyst til at se ham. Jo, Guldsmeden gaar hjem or forretter det, og Svenden rejser ogsaa ned paa Slottet. Da Prinsessen saa ham, saa siger hun: &#x201D;Men vil du da ikke have mig?&#x201D; Jo, siger han, dersom hun vilde saa gj&#xE6;rne, saa vilde han nok f&#xF8;je hende i det nu. De kalder saa Kongen ind til ham og snakker med ham om det, og da han har faaet Redelighed paa, hvordan det har sig, saa giver han ogsaa Lov til, at de maa faa hinanden, og saa skulde han ogsaa have Riget. Der bliver saa holdt Bryllup, og det var nu altsammen saa meget godt. Da de nu havde v&#xE6;ret samme i nogle Aar, saa siger han en Dag til hende, om hun havde ikke Lyst til at f&#xF8;lge med ham hjem og se til hans For&#xE6;ldre. Jo, hun siger jo. &#x201D;Ja, de har det godt, og de har nok at leve af.&#x201D; Der bliver saa sp&#xE6;ndt for, og de kommer til Kj&#xF8;ren. Da Vognen kommer saa ind i Gaarden, da sad Mand og Kone inde, og de siger: &#x201D;J&#xF8;sse Kors, hvad er det for fine fremmede her kommer! Hvad skal vi gj&#xF8;re ved dem?&#x201D; siger Konen, &#x201D;vi har ikke sa fine Stuer, vi kan vise dem ind i.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Aa, Stuerne er gode nok,&#x201D; siger Manden, &#x201D;lad dem kuns komme ind.&#x201D; Han gaar saa ud og faar dem hjulpen af Vognen og faar dem b&#xF8;jen ind. Saa sp&#xF8;rger han jo, om de vilde ikke have noget at leve af. Jo, det vilde de godt; om de kunde blive der i Nat? &#x201D;Aa, Gud bedre det,&#x201D; siger Konen, &#x201D;vi har ikke andet en et Gj&#xE6;stekammer,&#x201D; om de var forn&#xF8;jede med at ligge der. Ja, det var de st&#xE6;rkt forn&#xF8;jede med, det vilde de hellere end gj&#xE6;rne. Konen var tidlig oppe n&#xE6;ste Morgen, og hun gik og kikkede, om de vilde ikke snart rejse dem. Endelig kommer de i Kl&#xE6;derne, og hun kommer saa med noget Vand i hendes S&#xF8;lvfad, som de skulde have at vaske dem i. De skal saa ind at spise. Saa siger Prinsen: &#x201D;H&#xF8;r, I to gamle Folk, har I ingen B&#xF8;rn?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Aa, Herre Gud,&#x201D; siger de, &#x201D;vi har haft en enlig S&#xF8;n, men han er rejst v&#xE6;k fra os, vi har haft ham i mange L&#xE6;rer, og lige meget hjalp det.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Kan I kjende ham?&#x201D; siger Prinsen. &#x201D;Ja,&#x201D; siger hans Moder, &#x201D;han har et Kjendetegn paa hans venstre Arm, det er en r&#xF8;d Plet, og naar a ser den, saa kan kjende ham.&#x201D; Han knappede saa op og viste hende Tegnet. &#x201D;Aa, Herre Gud, er det min S&#xF8;n!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Kan I nu se,&#x201D; siger han igjen, &#x201D;te I har taget Fadet og ladet mig vaske mig af, som Fuglene sang om, og I sagde endda, det skulde aldrig ske. A har gjort en lykkelig Rejse og er bleven gift med Prinsessen." Saa snakkede de begge to med dem, om de kunde ikke have Lyst til at f&#xF8;lge med dem hjem. &#x201D;Ja, hvad skal vi gj&#xF8;re ved det, vi har?&#x201D; siger Manden. &#x201D;Det kan I dele imellem de fattige,&#x201D; siger S&#xF8;nnen. &#x201D;Ja, da vil vi godt hen og v&#xE6;re med vor S&#xF8;n,&#x201D; siger Moderen, og saa blev det ordnet saadan, og nu fulgte de med dem til Slottet og blev der for Fremtiden. Saa kunde de da blive kloge paa, te han havde faaet l&#xE6;rt hans Haandv&#xE6;rker til Gavns.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There were two old people and they had just one son. One day he thought that he was tired of staying at home all the time and so he asked to be put into an apprenticeship. &#x201C;What type of apprenticeship would you like to be put into?&#x201D; said his father. Well, he&#x2019;d most like to be a cobbler, because it would be good to get some shoes. The old couple were well off, and so they drive him off to a cobbler and reach an agreement with him to take the son as an apprentice. They were to give the cobbler four hundred daler for that and then he was to be good to their son. He starts the apprenticeship, the son does, and he became a very talented cobbler. Then the cobbler says to him, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t teach you anything more now, and so now it is best that I write to your parents that they can come and get you.&#x201D; &#x201C;No, you should write that I&#x2019;m a fool who can&#x2019;t learn a thing and that I&#x2019;m no longer interested either.&#x201D; The cobbler had to write that, too, and the parents had to come and get him. Well, they doubted quite a bit. He&#x2019;d had no interest in being at home the whole time he&#x2019;d been at home. Then the son comes home again. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with the fact that you didn&#x2019;t become a cobbler,&#x201D; they said, &#x201C;because you can stay here with us at home for a while, we have plenty for you to do.&#x201D; After he&#x2019;d been at home for a little while, then he asks if he can&#x2019;t start another apprenticeship. &#x201C;Sure, what type of apprenticeship would you like now?&#x201D; &#x201C;A goldsmith apprenticeship,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;since that&#x2019;s clean work and I really would like that.&#x201D; Sure, the parents had nothing against that either and so they take him to a goldsmith and ask him what he wants to teach their son the profession. Well, he wanted four hundred daler. "Well, then you have to teach him well, he had one apprenticeship before, but he wasn&#x2019;t interested in it.&#x201D; He promised and then they were happy to give him the money. The son comes to the goldsmith and is there for a while, and he learned so well that he had now become better than the master and was able to do things that the master couldn&#x2019;t. Then the goldsmith says, &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;d better write home to your parents that they can come and get you, because now you&#x2019;ve been fully taught.&#x201D; &#x201C;No, don&#x2019;t write that, you should write that I don&#x2019;t have any desire to be a goldsmith, and that I&#x2019;m a fool who can&#x2019;t learn anything.&#x201D; Well, that&#x2019;s not what he thought, but in the end the boy got him to write that. The parents came for him and they said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s what we expected, he&#x2019;s been at home with us the whole time, and he&#x2019;s had an apprenticeship before, and that didn&#x2019;t lead to anything. But he can stay at home with us, since we have enough.&#x201D; He came home and stayed there a while. Then he says, &#x201C;I think I want to have another apprenticeship, now I&#x2019;ve decided I&#x2019;d like to go and learn the speech of birds.&#x201D; They thought that was strange, but the son was used to getting his way, and he wanted to head off. Then his father goes along with him to the man who knew the speech of birds, and arranges with him to teach his son, and he was to get four hundred daler for that. "But then you&#x2019;d better teach him well, because now he&#x2019;s been an apprentice twice, and that hasn&#x2019;t led to anything.&#x201D; Yes, he&#x2019;d certainly do that, and the son begins the apprenticeship and becomes so good at the language that he could understand every bird. After he&#x2019;d been there a while, the master says, &#x201C;Well now I&#x2019;m going to write home to your parents, because you&#x2019;re good enough now that they can come and get you.&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, you can certainly do that,&#x201D; says the boy, &#x201C;then you&#x2019;ll have that pleasure.&#x201D; He comes home again and after he&#x2019;s been at home for a little while, a bird comes one day and sits and sings. &#x201C;What is it singing?&#x201D; says the mother. &#x201C;It's singing that I am going to go out traveling soon.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;What are you going to go out traveling for?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, it's just singing that.&#x201D; Then another bird came, and it sang too, he was to go out traveling, because there was so much good waiting for him. The mother didn&#x2019;t like this. Then a third bird came and sang. &#x201C;What is it singing?&#x201D; asks the mother. &#x201C;It is singing that I am going to come home so fine that you won&#x2019;t recognize me and that you&#x2019;ll take out the silver platter and let me wash myself in it.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;That will never happen, that I&#x2019;ll take my silver platter and let you wash yourself in it,&#x201D; says the mother. &#x201C;OK, but now I&#x2019;m going to go,&#x201D; says the son, &#x201C;because the bird keeps singing about that,&#x201D; and then he set off on his journey. First he came to a cobbler who lived close to the castle and worked for the royals. Just then, a message comes from the princess, that she&#x2019;d lost one of her shoes and now she wanted the cobbler to make her one just like it. But the cobbler didn&#x2019;t think that he could sew such a beautiful one because he&#x2019;d gone up to the castle to look at it. But then he remembered that he&#x2019;d just gotten a new journeyman and it could be that he was talented enough to do it. He goes home to the journeyman and talks with him about it. &#x201C;Sure, I can sew that,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve often done such fine work.&#x201D;  Well it was to be done by the next day. &#x201C;It certainly can be done by then,&#x201D; he says. He goes out to the workshop and is to sew this here shoe, and the cobbler went and looked in on him through the door now and then, he didn&#x2019;t think he was doing anything. But the next morning it was done and the cobbler goes down to the castle to the princess with it. When she sees it, she asks if she can&#x2019;t see the journeyman. The cobbler goes home and says that the princess wants to talk with him. He goes down there and when she sees him, she wants to have him. But he wasn&#x2019;t interested in that yet. He wants to go to a goldsmith because he&#x2019;d also learned that profession. Then another message comes to the goldsmith from the princess asking if he&#x2019;d make her a gold finger ring, and it was to be the most beautiful one that he could make. A messenger was sent for him, but the goldsmith said that he was afraid that he couldn&#x2019;t make one as shiny as she wished. But he&#x2019;d just gotten a journeyman and he&#x2019;d ask him about that, if he could make it, because he was apparently quite talented. He comes home and talks to him about it. &#x201C;Sure, I can certainly make that,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;I can make rings and everything.&#x201D; It was to be done by the next day, and now he was going to start smithing it. The goldsmith goes and looks in on him through the door, but he didn&#x2019;t really think that he was doing anything. Then the next morning he goes in there and asks about it. &#x201C;Yes, it's been done for a while,&#x201D; says the journeyman, and then the goldsmith goes down to the princess with it. It was the shiniest ring she&#x2019;d ever had, would the journeyman come down to her, she wanted to see him. Sure, the goldsmith goes home and arranges it, and the journeyman goes down to the castle. When the princess sees him, she says: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you want me?&#x201D; Sure, he says, because she really wants to, he&#x2019;d agree now. Then the king calls him in to him and he talks to him about it, and when he has been reassured about how things stand, then he gives his permission, and they can have each other and then he was to get the kingdom as well. They hold a wedding and that was all quite nice. After the two had been together for several years, he asks her one day if she would like to follow him home and visit his parents. Sure, she says yes. &#x201C;Yes, they&#x2019;re fine and they have plenty to live off.&#x201D; The horses are hitched up and they drive off. When the wagon comes into the farmyard, the mother and father were sitting inside and they say, &#x201C;Jesus Christ, what kind of fine strangers have arrived! What are we going to do with them?&#x201D; says the mother, &#x201C;we don&#x2019;t have fine rooms to which we can show them.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Oh, the rooms are good enough,&#x201D; says the father, &#x201C;just let them come in.&#x201D; He goes out and helps them out of the wagon and gets them inside. Then he asks them if they&#x2019;d like something to eat. Yes, they would; could they stay there that night? &#x201C;Oh good Lord,&#x201D; says the mother, &#x201C;we only have one guest room,&#x201D; would they be OK staying there? Sure, they&#x2019;d be delighted, they&#x2019;d be more than happy. The mother got up early the next morning and she went and looked to see if they were going to get up soon. Finally they get dressed and she comes with some water in her silver platter, they were to have that to wash themselves in. Then they were to come in and eat. Then the prince says, &#x201C;Listen, you two old people, don&#x2019;t you have any children?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Oh, dear God,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;we had a single son, but he has journeyed off from us, we had him in many apprenticeships, and it didn&#x2019;t help any.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Would you recognize him?&#x201D; says the prince. &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; says his mother, &#x201C;he has a mark on his left arm, it is a red spot and when I see it, then I will recognize him.&#x201D; He unbuttoned his shirt and showed her the mark. &#x201C;Oh, dear God, is this my son?!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Can you see now,&#x201D; he says again, &#x201C;that you&#x2019;ve taken the platter and let me wash myself in it, just as the birds sang, and you said that it would never happen. I&#x2019;ve had a wonderful journey and married the princess.&#x201D; Then the two talk with them, and asked if they didn&#x2019;t want to come home with them. &#x201C;Well, what would we do with what we have?&#x201D; says the father. &#x201C;You can share it amongst the poor,&#x201D; says the son. &#x201C;Well, then we&#x2019;ll gladly go and be with our son,&#x201D; says the mother, and then it was arranged like that, and they followed them to the castle and stayed there for the future. And then they discovered that he&#x2019;d learned his crafts thoroughly.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Margrete's proverbial interlude here underscores the importance that she ascribes to shelter. It may reflect her own concerns with poverty and the lack of independence that would follow from being cared for in the local poorhouse. 

     In the published version, which Tang Kristensen printed under the rubric of landskabsord (rural sayings), he added the clarification of husv&#xE6;ssel last. The word does not appear in Feilberg's dictionary of Jutlandic dialect.

     This short statement marks the end of a fieldwork session. The next morning, Tang Kristensen visited with Rasmus Peter Motensen, a r&#xF8;gter (feed master) in the same parish before returning  to Margrete.</annotation>

    <annotation>Repeating the pattern from their first session, Margrete starts her second session with a ballad, in this case, a short love song. This session turned out to be her longest with Tang Kristensen.

     The only difference between the published version of this song and the manuscript version is a correction in the fourth verse to account for the meter ("Hver gang at jeg hende ser" in the manuscript as opposed to the printed "Hver gang, jeg hend' ser"). The change does not alter the meaning of the verse.</annotation>

    <annotation>This story shares elements with tale types ATU 564, "The Magic Providing Purse," ATU 595a, "Cow is sold for three magic objects," and ATU 331, "The Spirit in the Bottle," although it diverges from all of them substantially. In ATU 564, the return of the magic object is compelled by the use of another magic object. In ATU 595a, the story ends with the rescue of a princess from a giant, while in ATU 332, the helpful genie does not appear. 

      Margrete's reference to a named and presumably historically verifiable figure departs from the expected anonymity of most folk tales. The tale does not fit the model that Holbek proposed for the fairy tale since, unlike most wonder tales, the story does not end in a wedding (the male and female protagonists are already married). It is also difficult to characterize any of the conflicts splitting across Holbek's high status / low status divide. Potentially, one can read the antagonistic neighbor as a representative of the high status group, although there are no narrative clues supporting such an interpretation. 

     The collaboration between the husband and wife is presented as a positive force in the tale. The wife's early reasoning about keeping a roof over their heads parallels Margrete's short saying at the end of her first session. Neighbors are represented as a clear economic threat to the well-being of the farm. The implication of the story is that bargaining with supernatural beings, as well as with neighbors, can be dangerous. In bargains with the supernatural, one cannot immediately assess the value of the proffered payment. This type of transaction stands as an extreme example of the barter transactions that were ubiquitous in the rural economies of the late nineteenth century (Tangherlini 1998).  The subsequent bargain struck with the neighbor brings the supernatural bargain into the realm of the everyday. That S&#xF8;ren Jensen agrees to trade his cow for a bottle on the way to market is worth noting, as any kind of trading on the way to or from a market was explicitly forbidden by law (Tangherlini 2012). Indeed, it may be S&#xF8;ren's willingness to break the law that allows the supernatural to come into the everyday world, and results in the extraordinary nature of the bargains.

    As with most of Margrete's folk tales, this one was never published.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a husband and wife who had a smallholding but they couldn't really make ends meet. As long as the wife had some canvas to sell, she would give her husband one piece after another, whenever there were expenses to be paid. It got so bad that the only thing they had left was to bring their cow to market and sell it. The wife thought about that, and thought it was best to have a roof over their heads as long as they possibly could. Pulls it. Along the way a man in a strange outfit, a big long cape that reached all the way down to his heels. Even though it was still summer. Followed along with each other. Was he going to the market? Yes. Had gotten so bad that he didn't have anything else to sell. Would he sell it to him. Sure, if he'd give him enough for it. Yes he had a bottle. ... A bottle. Yes, you'll likely be happy with it, when you get home. Have your wife spread a table cloth on the floor, and then put the table on it and then set the table and have her wish for whatever she wants. Then take the cork out of the bottle. Even if it is dishes from the royal table that you wish for. He got home and Maren asked him what he'd gotten. A Bottle. Bottle. Then he told her about the man, and what he looked like. Yes, the wife knew him well enough, it was one of the mound dwellers. Then they wished and it was like the royal table. The husband thought he wanted to have roast goose and cut into it. But it was stuffed with coins and they spilled out onto the floor. Was happy. They had money for their expenses and the wife. Hey, we can wish for some more another time. The husband finished eating, and it disappeared into the bottle. It went well for many years, and the neighbors couldn't understand it. One day a neighborhood man came over to talk about it. Told about the bottle for the cow. Would he sell it. No, figured he'd keep it. Came again the next day. Sneaked it away from him. Then things got so bad for S&#xF8;ren Jensen that he had to go and sell his cow again. As he is pulling it to market, the same person came to him again. It wasn't like that. Took the cork out and two evil spirits came out and beat up S. Jensen. Thought it was the wrong bottle. Went up and traded it with his neighbor. Had gotten a new one that was much better. Traded. Two beat him up. Really angry at S.J. and he got beaten both by the neighbor and another and there was such an uproar it was dangerous.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en Mand og en Kone, de sad ved en bitte N&#xE6;ring og kunde ikke vel begaa dem. Saa L&#xE6;nge Konen havde noget L&#xE6;rred at s&#xE6;lge, saa flyede hun Manden et Stykke efter et andet, for at han kunde faa en Skilling til at faa Udgifterne d&#xE6;kket, men til sidst var det forbi med det, og saa gik det dem til sidst saa n&#xE6;r, at de havde ikke uden deres Ko at gj&#xF8;re i Penge. Saa siger Manden om han skulde ikke tr&#xE6;kke til Marked og s&#xE6;lge den. Jo, det tykte Konen nok; der var jo ikke andet at gj&#xF8;re, og det var da bedst at blive ved Husv&#xE6;rselet saa l&#xE6;nge de kunde. Han tr&#xE6;kker altsaa med den og paa Vejen kommer han saa til en Mand, der gik i forunderlig Kl&#xE6;dedragt. Han gik i en stor lang Kappe, der naaede ham rent ned til H&#xE6;lene, og saa var det endda en Sommerdag. De kommer saa i F&#xF8;lge med hinanden, og Manden sp&#xF8;rger ham, om han skulde til Marked. Ja han skulde, nu var det gaaet ham saa n&#xE6;r, at han havde ikke andet end den Ko at s&#xE6;lge. &#x201D;Vil du s&#xE6;lge den til mig?&#x201D; siger den fremmede. &#x201D;Jo, det vil a jo nok, hvis du vil give nok for den.&#x201D; Ja, han havde her en Flaske, og den vilde han give ham for Koen. &#x201D;En Flaske!&#x201D; siger Manden. &#x201D;Ja, den Flaske skal du nok blive forn&#xF8;jet med, naar du kommer hjem. Du kan lade din Kone brede en Dug paa Gulvet og saa s&#xE6;tte Bordet paa den. Saa kan du tage Tolden af Flasken, og saa kan hun &#xF8;nske sig, hvad hun vil, om det saa er Retter fra det kongelige Taffel, saa skal Bordet nok blive d&#xE6;kket med det.&#x201D; Ja, det var jo ikke saa galt, tykte Manden, og saa byttede de, og han gik saa hjem med hans Flaske. Da han nu kommer hjem, saa sp&#xF8;rger Maren: &#x201D;Naa hvad fik du saa for Koen?&#x201D; &#x201D;A fik en Flaske!&#x201D; &#x201D;En Flaske!&#x201D; siger hun helt forundet, og saa fortalte han det hele om den Mand, og hvordan han saa ud. Ja, ham kjendte Konen godt nok, det var &#xE9;n af H&#xF8;jfolkene. Nu skulde de til at pr&#xF8;ve Flasken, og saa skulde de til at &#xF8;nske. Manden tykte, han vilde have Gaasesteg, og saa stod den paa Bordet. Han skar saa Hul paa den, og da var Kroppen udstoppet med ene Penge, og de trillede ud paa Gulvet. Nu kan det nok v&#xE6;re, de blev glade, nu havde de jo rigelig Erstatning for deres Ko, og havde Penge nok til Udgifterne. &#x201D;Ja, vi kan jo &#xF8;nske os nogle flere en anden Gang,&#x201D; siger Manden, og de satte dem saa til at spise. Da de havde afspist, saa forsvandt det hele igjen i Flasken, og Manden satte Tolden i. Nu begik de sig st&#xE6;rkt i mange Aar, og Naboerne kunde ikke forstaa, hvordan de var komne saadan til Kering. En dag gaar &#xE9;n af Nabom&#xE6;nderne derom og vil snakke med dem om det, han var jo bleven saa nysgjerrig. Endelig maa Manden til at fort&#xE6;lle, hvordan han havde handlet med Koen og faaet en Flaske for. Saa sp&#xF8;rger Naboen, om han vil ikke s&#xE6;lge den Flaske. Nej, det vilde han rigtig nok ikke, den kom han til at beholde. Saa gik Nabomanden med det, men han kom Andendagen igjen og blev ved at snakke om den Flaske, og han vilde da absolut kj&#xF8;be den af ham. Saa lister han ham omsider ogsaa til at s&#xE6;lge ham den. Man da S&#xF8;ren Jensen var af med Flasken, saa var Heldet ogsaa vegen fra ham, og det gik ham til sidst saa n&#xE6;r, at han skulde hen og s&#xE6;lge hans Ko igjen for at faa Penge til Udgifterne. Idet han nu tr&#xE6;kker til Marked, saa kommer den samme Person atter til ham, som han f&#xF8;r havde handlet med, og han sp&#xF8;rger, om han vil bytte igjen og have en Flaske for hans Ko. Ja, det vilde han godt, og de faar snart den Handel gjort. Han kommer nok saa sj&#xE6;leglad hjem med Flasken og fort&#xE6;ller hans Kone, hvordan en Handel han nu igjen har gjort. Hun var ogsaa vel tilfreds med det, og de skal til at d&#xE6;kke Bord, men da han saa tager Tolden af Flasken, saa kommer der to onde Aander i Land af den, og de begynder at prygle l&#xF8;s paa S&#xF8;ren Jensen. Det var jo en gal Flaske, han der havde faaet, men saa kommer han i Tanker om, han vil hen og bytte med Naboen, der havde faaet den f&#xF8;rste Flaske. Han kommer saa om til ham og siger, &#x201D;Nu har a faaet en ny Flaske og den er meget bedre. Kunde du have Lyst til at bytte med mig?&#x201D; Ja, han var nok saa begj&#xE6;rlg og vilde gj&#xE6;rne bytte. De fik Handelen gjort, og S&#xF8;ren Jensen rejser af. Men nu skal den anden til at pr&#xF8;ve hans ny Flaske, og han faar Tolden af. Da kommer de to Dj&#xE6;vle jo og banker l&#xF8;s paa ham. Nu blev han jo for Alvor gal paa S&#xF8;ren Jensen, og han gaar om og giver ham en Dragt Prygl. Der var ogsaa andre, han fik til at hj&#xE6;lpe sig, og nu fik S&#xF8;ren Jensen det ikke saa godt. Men der var ikke andet at sige til det, end han kunde have beholdt hans Flaske.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a husband and wife, they had a tiny little holding and couldn&#x2019;t make ends meet. As long as the wife had some canvas to sell, she would giver her husband one piece after another, so that he could get a shilling to cover their expenses, but finally it was over with that, and finally it got so bad that they didn&#x2019;t have anything left that they could convert to money but their cow. Then the husband asks if he shouldn&#x2019;t pull it off to market and sell it. Yes, the wife thought that he should do that; there was nothing else to do and it was best to have a roof over their heads as long as possible. He pulls it along and on the road he meets a man who was walking there in a strange outfit. He was wearing a big long cape that reached all the way to his heels even though it was still summer. They follow along with each other, and the man asks him if he was headed to market. Yes he was, now things had gotten so bad that he had nothing but his cow to sell. &#x201C;Will you sell it to me?&#x201D; asks the stranger. &#x201C;Yes, I certainly will, if you&#x2019;ll give me enough for it.&#x201D; Well, he had a bottle and he&#x2019;d give him the bottle for the cow. &#x201C;A bottle?&#x201D; says the man. &#x201C;Yes, you&#x2019;ll be quite pleased with this bottle when you get home. You can let your wife spread a tablecloth on the floor and then set the table on it. Then you can take the stopper from the bottle and then you can wish yourself whatever you want; even if it is dishes from the royal table, the table will be set with that.&#x201D; That wasn&#x2019;t so bad, thought the man, and so they traded, and he went home with his bottle. When he gets home, Maren asks: &#x201C;Well, what did you get for the cow?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;I got a bottle!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;A bottle?&#x201D; she says, utterly dismayed, and then he told her the whole thing about the man and how he looked. Yes, the wife knew him well, that was one of the mound dwellers. Now they were going to try the bottle, and they were going to wish. The man thought that he wanted roast goose and there it was on the table. He cut into it and the body was stuffed with coins, and they spilled out onto the floor. Now they were happy, now they&#x2019;d gotten plenty for their cow, and had lots of money for their expenses. &#x201C;Well, we can wish for more another time,&#x201D; says the husband, and they sat down to eat. When they were finished eating, it all disappeared back into the bottle and the man put the stopper back in. Now, it went well for them for many years, and the neighbors couldn&#x2019;t understand how they&#x2019;d managed such a change. One day one of the neighbor men comes by and wants to talk to them about it, he&#x2019;d become so curious. Finally, the husband has to tell him how he&#x2019;d traded the cow and gotten a bottle for it. Then the neighbor asks if he didn&#x2019;t want to sell the bottle. No, he really didn&#x2019;t want to, he was going to hold onto it. Then the neighbor went off with that answer, but the next day he came again and continued to talk about the bottle, and he absolutely wanted to buy it from him. Finally he convinces him to sell it to him. But when S&#xF8;ren Jensen no longer had the bottle, then all his luck disappeared as well, and finally it went so bad for him that he had to go and sell his cow again to get money for his expenses. As he is heading off to market, the same person whom he&#x2019;d dealt with comes to him again and he asks if he wants to trade again and get a bottle for his cow. Yes, he certainly did, and they soon seal the deal. He comes home quite happy with the bottle, and tells his wife what kind of deal he has made again. She was also satisfied with it and they went to set the table, but when they take the stopper out of the bottle, two evil spirits come out of it and they begin to beat S&#xF8;ren Jensen. It was the wrong bottle he&#x2019;d gotten there, but then he comes up with the idea that he&#x2019;ll trade it with the neighbor, who had gotten the first bottle. He comes up to him and says, &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;ve gotten a new bottle, and it is much better. Would you like to swap with me?&#x201D; Yes, he was quite eager and would gladly trade. They finished the deal and S&#xF8;ren Jensen goes off. But now the other one was going to try his new bottle and he gets the stopper off. Then the two devils come and beat wildly on him. Now he gets really mad at S&#xF8;ren Jensen, and goes over and gives him a real beating. There were others, too, that he&#x2019;d gotten to help him and now S&#xF8;ren Jensen wasn&#x2019;t doing too well. But there was nothing more to say about that other than he could have kept his bottle.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Margrete tells a version of ATU 326, "The Youth Who Wanted to Learn What Fear is," in which the motif of buried treasure is repeated. With both treasures, the solicitous haunt whom the boy confronts instructs him to distribute these ill-gotten gains among the victims or the poor. This distribution of wealth aligns well with other variants of ATU 326a, "Soul Released from Torment". 

      The story has a great deal in common with legends about guilty, solicitous haunts (Pentika&#xEF;nen 1969), and less in common with the wonder tales described by Holbek (1987). The innkeeper and the king represent two distinct classes and their "thefts" are qualitatively different. In the first case, it is a question of simple theft, whereas in the second case, it is a question of taxation (without representation) being equated to theft. In post-constitution Denmark, significant debate surrounded taxation, and the right of the local versus the national government to tax the local populations. In many ATU 326 variants, the boy finally learns fear from something mundane, such as cold water being thrown on him, or fish being placed in his bed, which is not the case in Margrete's story. In her variant, he is frightened by the overwhelming onslaught of the warrior ghosts.

     This tale was never published. The fair copy version expands significantly on descriptions found in the field diaries but does not change the overall structure or the individual episodes that comprise the tale.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A girl had gone out one evening to get some peat and had gotten scared. The farmhand asks her what she could be afraid of in a peat house. Asks if he'd come out with her with the lamp then they'd be able to see it. It turned out there was a hedgehog lying there in the peat. That was nothing to be afraid of. Then he'd heard that there was an inn, he wanted to go there and see if he'd get frightened. He went there and asked to spend the night there. It would be no good to stay there, they had another house to stay in. He really wanted to stay there and see what it was. There was always a bed made up there. He went over and lay down in it. It was a nice warm bed, and just about midnight, someone comes and wants to climb into bed with him. Wow, you're cold, but come on in to me, you can get warm. Then he came to life and it was the old innkeeper, he had buried a lot of money, and he was walking once again because of that and wanted the money to be revealed. He followed with him to the place, it was buried in the cellar in a big pot. He was to take as much as he wanted and the rest were for the people whom he had duped out of their money, then he'd get peace. The next morning, the people came back and he lay there sleeping safe and sound. They called out and asked him how he was. Good. Such and such... the innkeeper had done so many wrongs. But now there was a pot of money. The money was split among the people who'd been duped. After that, no one ever walked again at that inn. Then he went on his way to a castle, he'd heard they couldn't be there either. He wanted to try to get frightened there--he asked if he couldn't stay there. No, my God, no one can stay here. We have to leave every night, there's so much haunting and stuff, we can't stay here, everyone who was here would be killed. Well, there was no danger of that, but he wanted a slave to stay with him. Fine. They were left alone together and they looked around, there was a lot of ham hanging in the chimney. Wanted to cook them some peas. If he'd go get the firewood, he'd go get the water, and light it. Then the slave disappeared. He couldn't understand that. He went out and the slave was lying there with his nose up his ass and he was dead. What are you lying there for? No answer. Took the firewood inside and boiled his peas. Then he goes to bed. Twelve men come in with a coffin and put it down in front of the bed he was lying in and they take the lid off of it. The man gets up and wants to climb into bed with the farmhand as well. It's horrible how cold you are--don't you want to have some peas, it will warm you up. He answers yes. Yes, thank God for that meal, it is has been many years since I had anything to eat. But now I can do as well for you, come with me down to my cellar. There were three pots buried down there and each one was full of money. That's why there was no peace there, he'd taken such huge taxes from the country. The one pot was for the king, the second he could have some of, and the third was to be split among all the people in the country. The next morning the people came, and he was sleeping as if he'd slept the whole night through. Yes he was quite well. Told them why there were disturbances. The old king went again and they got busy with digging up the money. He told the people what the king had said about taxes etc. He still wasn't frightened. Went to another castle, there was quite a commotion there. Sets off and arrives there. Asks if he can stay. No one can stay, there's too much haunting and such commotion, every one who has stayed has been killed. A lot of warriors with weapons came and there's a huge commotion all night long, they were fencing and he lay under the blanket the whole time and didn't dare let himself be seen. He got frightened that time because he didn't discover what it was. He'd traveled until he got frightened.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>En Pige var ude efter T&#xF8;rv om Aftningen, og saa kommer hun ind og siger, at hun var bleven saa r&#xE6;d. &#x201D;Hvad kan du v&#xE6;r bleven r&#xE6;d for,&#x201D; siger Karlen, inde i et T&#xF8;rvehus. &#x201D;A kan aldrig blive r&#xE6;d for noget.&#x201D; Ja, om han saa vilde f&#xF8;lge med hende ud med Lygten, saa kunde de faa det at se. Han t&#xE6;nder ogsaa Lygten, og de gaar derud. Da er det et Pindsvin, der laa i T&#xF8;rvene, og han gjorde jo saadan Nar ad hende. &#x201D;Det var ikke noget at blive r&#xE6;d for,&#x201D; siger han, nej, der skulde noget andet til, hvis han skulde blive r&#xE6;d, og han talte store Ord. Saa havde han h&#xF8;rt, der var et Kroer, hvor der gik sp&#xF8;gelser, og nu blev han opsat paa, han vilde derhen og se, om han kunde blive r&#xE6;d. Han kom saa ogsaa rejsende dertil og forlanger at ligge der. &#x201D;Ja, det kan ikke hj&#xE6;lpe du bliver her i Nat,&#x201D; siger Folkene, &#x201D;der kan ingen ligge her, vi har et andet Hus at ligge i om Natten.&#x201D; Men han vilde nu v&#xE6;re der og se, hvad der var, og saa fik han da ogsaa Lov til det. Der skulde altid v&#xE6;re en opredt Seng der og den fik han Lov at ligge i. Han gaar saa til Ro, da de andre var tagne hen, og da Klokken var bleven hen imod 12, og han var bleven godt varm i Sengen, saa kommer der &#xE9;n og vil i Seng til ham. &#x201D;Uha, hvor du er kold,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;men put dig ind til mig, du kan blive varm.&#x201D; Saa gjorde han ogsaa det, og nu kom den til Live, og han fortalte, at han var den gamle Kroermand der i Kroeret, og han havde gravet saa mange Penge ned, dem var det nu, han gik efter, for han skulde have det aabenbaret. Han beder ham f&#xF8;lge med ham til Stedet, hvor de var gravet ned. Det var i en Kj&#xE6;lder, og de stod i en stor Kjedel. Saa beder han ham tage de Penge, han vilde, og de andre skulde han give til dem, han havde bedraget dem fra, saa haabede han nok at faa Ro. Derefter sov han rolig til Dag. Om Morgenen kom Folkene tilbage, og da laa han og sov trygt. Saa kaldte de paa ham og spurgte, hvordan han havde det. Ja, han havde det godt. Det var gaaet saadan og saadan. Den Kroermand, der havde v&#xE6;ret der f&#xF8;r, han havde gjort saa megen Uret, og han vilde have det aabenbaret med de Penge, det var derfor, han gik. Nu var det det med den Kjedel Penge, og han fik dem med ned i Kj&#xE6;lderen, og de fik dem op. Nu skulde det jo oplyses imellem dem, der var blevne bedragede, at de kunde faa deres Penge igjen, og det skete, og siden var der aldrig nogen, der gik igjen i den Kro. Saa rejste Karlen videre frem, for han kunde nok have Lyst til at rejse, til han blev r&#xE6;d. Han kommer saa til et Slot, og havde han h&#xF8;rt, de kunde heller ikke v&#xE6;re, nu vilde han pr&#xF8;ve, om han kunde blive r&#xE6;d der. Saa sp&#xF8;rger han jo, om han kan blive der om Natten. &#x201D;Aa nej Herregud, her kan ingen Mennesker v&#xE6;re,&#x201D; siger de, &#x201D;vi maa selv vige hver Nat, saa meget Sp&#xF8;geri og Skidteri der er her.&#x201D;&#x2014;Nej, vi kan ikke v&#xE6;re her, de bliver kv&#xE6;ld alle dem, der er her.&#x2014;&#x201D;Ja, det er vel ingen Fare,&#x201D; siger han. Men han vilde nok have en Slave til at v&#xE6;re ved ham, og saa vilde han pr&#xF8;ve at blive der en Nat. Ja, det var jo godt nok, og der bliver saa taget &#xE9;n ud, som skal v&#xE6;re ved ham. Da de nu blev enlige med hinanden, saa gav han sig til at se sig omkring. Der h&#xE6;ngte saa meget Fl&#xE6;sk i Skorstenen, og saa vilde de til at koge dem nogle &#xC6;rter, for han var bleven sulten. Han siger saa til denher Slave om at hente noget Br&#xE6;ndsel og saa noget Vand, og saa vilde de til at gj&#xF8;re Ild paa. Slaven gik ogsaa, men han blev henne. Det kunde Karlen ikke forstaa, og han gaar saa ud for at se efter ham. Da ligger han der med N&#xE6;sen b&#xF8;jet helt om i R&#xF8;ven og var d&#xF8;d. &#x201D;Hvad ligger du der efter?&#x201D; siger han, men han svarte jo ikke. Saa gaar han ind med Br&#xE6;ndselet og faar Ild paa og faar hans &#xC6;rter kogt, og derefter gaar han i Seng. Saa kommer der tolv Karle med in Ligkiste, og den s&#xE6;tter de foran Sengen, han laa i, og tager Laaget af. Manden, som laa der, han rejser sig og vil i Seng til Karlen ogsaa. &#x201D;Det er da grov, saa kold du er,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;vil du ikke have nogle varme &#xC6;rter, saa du kan blive varmet op?&#x201D; Det svarer han ja til, og da han har spist, saa siger han: &#x201D;Ja Gudskelov for dem N&#xE6;tower, det er mange Aar siden a har faaet noget at spise. Men nu kan a da gj&#xF8;re lige saa godt imod dig, som du har gjort imod mig. Nu skal du f&#xF8;lge med ned i min Kj&#xE6;lder.&#x201D; Karlen rejser sig og f&#xF8;lger med ham, og saa ser han tre Kjedeler, som er gravet ned der, og de var fude af Penge alle tre. Han havde v&#xE6;ret Konge i Landet og havde taget for store Skatter, derfor kunde han ingen Ro faa i hans Grav. Nu skulde de Penge frem for Dagens Lys igjen. Den ene Kjedel maatte den Konge faa, der nu var i Landet, den anden maatte han tage nogle af, og de &#xF8;vrige skulde deles mellem Folkene i Landet. Det lovede han at faa gjort i Orden, og saa gik Kongen i hans Ligkiste igjen, og de 12 Karle kom og bar han v&#xE6;k. Om Morgenen kom Folkene tilbage til Slottet, og da sov Karlen trygt, han var jo udvaaget fra om Natten. De kalder saa paa ham og sp&#xF8;rger om, hvordan han har det. Ja, han havde det rigtig godt, siger han. Om han saa ikke kunde sige dem, hvorfor der var saadan Uro om Natten?&#x201D; Jo, det kan a godt, det er den gamle Konge, der gaar igjen, og det er for nogle Penge, han skal have aabenbaret, for han har taget for store Skatter af hans Land. Han viste dem saa, hvor Kjedlerne stod, og sagde, hvordan de skulde deles ud. Nu fik de jo travlt med at faa Pengene i Land og saa faa dem delt ud. Selv fik han nogle, Kongen fik den ene Tredjepart, og det &#xF8;vrige blev delt ud til Undersaatterne. Nu havde han skaffet dem Ro der, og saa rejste han derfra, men endnu var han ikke bleven r&#xE6;d. Saa kommer han til et andet Slot, og der var en sv&#xE6;r Anstalt. Han sp&#xF8;rger jo som s&#xE6;dvanlig om at blive, og Folkene de siger, at ingen kunde v&#xE6;re der, for der gik saa meget Sp&#xF8;geri og var saadan Elendighed, for alle var bleven kv&#xE6;ld, som havde v&#xE6;ret der. &#x201D;Det kan ikke gj&#xF8;re noget om a bliver kv&#xE6;kd, lad mig kuns blive.&#x201D; Han var der saa Natten over, men det var en farlig Tummel. Der kom mange Krigsfolk med Vaaben, og de f&#xE6;gtedes inde ved ham. Saa blev han rigtig nok r&#xE6;d og laa under Dynen hele Tiden og turde ikke lade sig se. Han fik ingen Redelighed paa, hvad det var, og der blev ingen Ting aabenbaret, saa dem fik han ikke befriet paa det Slot. Men nu havde han rejst saa l&#xE6;nge, til han var bleven r&#xE6;d.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A girl had gone out to get peat one evening and then she comes in and says that she had gotten scared. &#x201C;What could  you possibly have gotten scared of out in a peat-house?&#x201D; says the farmhand. &#x201C;Nothing ever scares me.&#x201D; Well, if he&#x2019;d follow her out with the lantern, then they could see what it was. He lights the lantern and they go out there. It was a hedgehog, lying in the peat, and so he teased her a lot. &#x201C;That was nothing to be scared of,&#x201D; he says; "no, you'd need to find something else if he was going to get scared," and he talked big. He had heard that there was an inn where there were ghosts and now he decided that he wanted to go there and asks to stay there. &#x201C;Well, it won&#x2019;t do any good for you to stay here tonight,&#x201D; say the people, &#x201C;no one can stay here, we have another house to stay in at night.&#x201D; But he wanted to stay there and see what it was, and he was given permission to do that. There was always supposed to be a bed made up there and he was given permission to lie in it. He settles down when everyone else has left, and when it was up toward twelve o&#x2019;clock, and he had gotten nice and warm in the bed, someone comes and wants to get into bed with him. &#x201C;Ooh, you&#x2019;re so cold,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;but never mind, come in to me, you can warm up.&#x201D; And so he did that, and now the ghost came to life and told him that he was the old innkeeper there in the inn and he&#x2019;d buried a lot of money. That was what he was haunting for, since he was supposed to disclose it. The ghost asks the farmhand to follow him to the place where it was buried. It was down in the cellar in a big pot. Then the ghost tells him to take the money he wanted and the rest he was to give to those the ghost had duped, then he hoped to have peace. After that the farmhand slept peacefully until the morning. That morning, the people came back and there he lay and slept soundly. Then they called him and asked how he was. Well, he was fine. Such and such had happened. The innkeeper who&#x2019;d been there before had done so much injustice and he wanted to disclose the thing with the money, that&#x2019;s why he haunted. Now there was the pot of money and he brought them down into the cellar and they got it up. Now they were to let everyone know who&#x2019;d been duped that they could get their money back, and that happened, and since then there was never anyone who haunted in that inn again. Then the farmhand journeyed on, because he wanted to keep traveling until he got scared. He comes to a castle, and he&#x2019;d heard that the people there couldn&#x2019;t stay there either, and now he wanted to see if he could get scared there. So he asks if he could stay there at night. &#x201C;Oh, good lord no, no one can stay here at night,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;we have to leave every night ourselves, there&#x2019;s so much haunting and bad stuff here. No, we can&#x2019;t stay here, everyone who stays here gets killed.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, there&#x2019;s no danger of that,&#x201D; he says. But he does want a slave to stay with him, and then he&#x2019;d try to stay there an entire night. Sure, that was fine, and so a slave was brought out who was to stay with him. When they are finally alone with each other, the farmhand started to look around. There was some ham hanging in the chimney and then they were going to boil themselves some peas, since he&#x2019;d gotten hungry. So he tells this slave to go get some firewood and then some water, and then they&#x2019;d start a fire. The slave left, too, but he didn&#x2019;t come back. The farmhand couldn&#x2019;t figure this out and he goes out to see what has happened to him. Then he discovers the slave lying there dead with his nose bent all the way up his ass. &#x201C;What are you lying there for?&#x201D; he says, but the slave didn&#x2019;t answer. So he goes in with the firewood and lights a fire and boils his peas, and after that he goes to bed. Then twelve men come in with a coffin and they put it in front of the bed he was lying in, and they take the cover off. The man who lay there in the coffin, he gets up and wants to get into the bed with the farmhand as well. &#x201C;It's rough how cold you are,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t you want some warm peas to warm you up?&#x201D; The dead man answers yes to that, and when he has eaten, then he says, &#x201C;Thank God for that dinner, it's been many years since I had that much to eat. But now I can be just as good to you as you&#x2019;ve been to me. Now follow me down to my cellar.&#x201D; The farmhand gets up and follows him, and then he sees three pots that have been buried there, and they were full of money, all three. The dead man had been the king of the country and he&#x2019;d taken too many taxes, that&#x2019;s why he couldn&#x2019;t get any rest in his grave. Now the money should be brought out into broad daylight again. The first pot was to go to the current king in the country, the farmhand could take some money from the second pot, and the rest was to be dealt out amongst the people in the country. He promised to do that, and then the king went back into his coffin again, and the twelve men came and carried him away. The next morning, the people came back to the castle and the farmhand was sleeping so soundly, he was exhausted from the night before. They call to him and ask him now how he was. Well, he was really very well, he says. Could he tell them why there was so much unrest at night? &#x201C;Yes, I certainly can, it's the old king, who is haunting, and it's because of some money he was to disclose because he took too many taxes from his country.&#x201D; He showed them where the cellar was and told them how the money was to be given out. Now they were busy with the money in the country and got it distributed. He got some himself, the king got a third, and the rest was given out to the subjects. Now he&#x2019;d gotten them quiet there and he journeyed off, but he still hadn&#x2019;t gotten scared. Then he comes to another castle and there was a great commotion there. He asks as usual to stay there, and the people say that no one could stay there because there was so much haunting, and such horror, since everyone had been killed who&#x2019;d stayed there. &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if I get killed, just let me stay.&#x201D; He stayed there the night, but there was an incredible tumult there. A lot of warriors came with weapons and they fought in the room where he was staying. Then he got really scared and lay under the covers the whole time and didn&#x2019;t dare let them see him. He never found out what it was, and nothing was revealed, and so he didn&#x2019;t free them there at that castle. But now he&#x2019;d traveled so long that he&#x2019;d gotten scared.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This amusing story relies on aspects of dialect and pronunciation for its comical effect. The story also provides commentary on popular attitudes toward ministers. The minister assumes an overly paternalistic tone toward the seemingly simple Maren, who lets loose with her off-color verse at the very end of an otherwise solemn funeral.

     The manuscript starts out with little dialect notation and then, after a false start, possibly on Tang Kristensen's side, switches to a dialect heavy recording. The obscene reference in the ending verse is covered by the use of an abbreviated dialect word in the published version, py.., an abbreviation for pyk, a dialect term for penis. The entire word is missing in the manuscript, Tang Kristensen having recorded only ellipses, his standard notation for words he considered obscene.

     This story is also cataloged as &#xC6;v 1461.</annotation>

    <annotation>The amusing rhyme that ends the previous story spills over into this children's rhyme, and marks a narrative departure from the folk tale.

     The first part of the rhyme appears to be a formula to induce rain, while the second part of the rhyme, starting with "Dear God," is more of a nonsense rhyme. Jens Kamp, in his collection, Danske folkeminder, included a variant of the second half of this children's rhyme that emphasized the nonsense aspect of it, while also poking fun at church functionaries (the minister, the parish clerk and the bell ringer).</annotation>

    <annotation>In this series of linked legends, Margrete explores the ability of a local folk healer, Klemmen, also mentioned by Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter (KMP 1.56). Although there is no biographical information about Klemmen in Birgitte R&#xF8;rbye's overview of folk healers, his practice is similar to that of many of his cohort described there (1976). 

     The theme of distrust and dishonesty among neighbors and friends informs the first of these stories and echoes themes found in many of Margrete's other stories. Rather than supporting an  ideal image of community where one can rely on neighbors for help, these stories paint a darker picture of a society where many people, even close friends, take whatever they can get.     

     Ministers and folk healers were often at odds with each other, as the folk healers represented a clear secular challenge to the authority of the church. Klemmen's ability to fix his tormentor in the mud up to his ankles resonates with stories of ministers who conjure farmhands into the ground (AMJ 1.06).

     The final story about the cursed cows highlights an important difference between witches and cunning folk. Whereas witches disrupt local economies for personal gain or vengeance (such as when they bewitch cows), cunning folk use magic to restore economic balance (such as finding the stolen canvas and the missing dog) and counteract disruptive forces.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man they called Klemmen in Sorte-Mose, they always went to him when they wanted something shown again (in Hortsh&#xF8;j parish). Then a woman came to him and wanted him to show two feet of canvas again. "Sure, you can see the woman." He put a tub of water in the middle of the floor and a mirror in front of her and a mirror behind her, and she was supposed to see the woman in the water there. "Because if I told you, you wouldn't believe me, but you'll see for yourself, since it's one of your best friends." When it had burned over at Jens Klemmensen's in H&#xE5;rup, Klemmen came and visited him because they were such good friends. Then he wanted him to show a small dog again that had disappeared during the fire, a little dog that was called Lubbis. I worked there, that's why I know that. "Well, if the dog's alive I'll get him for you, you can meet him tomorrow morning by the door, he'll be standing there and really happy to see you." It happened too. The next morning, the dog met him at the door. One time Klemmen was on his way to L&#xF8;gten, and they decided to make fun of him. But he chased one of the men out so he stood in mud up over his ankles until he [Klemmen] came back and so that guy didn't make it to L&#xF8;gten. When Klemmen got back he set him free. "Yeah, you've made fun of Klemmen for a long time, but I don't think you'll do it anymore, otherwise you could wind up standing like that again." Klemmen did so much magic like that and if people had cows that were bewitched [they'd go to him]. In Brandstrup we had some cows that got sick in their knees and three died. But then we went to find Klemmen and he helped them, after that we didn't have any that died. They were to have a half pint of their own milk eight mornings in a row.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Ghosts are a disruptive force that threaten the well-being of the living, and often upset the functioning of a well-ordered farm. In other variants, ministers or cunning folk are called to counteract the haunting (DS V 700; Tangherlini 1999).  The story's orientation presents the frightening specter of headless horses on their nocturnal ride to the church (KMP 1.14). No reason is given for the haunting, although one suspects that, given the ghost's royally conferred title, he is a guilty haunt. The farmhand's attempt to restore order ends in his death. In the original manuscript version, a second farmhand loses his life as well. That the stall door must be left open is an indication of the ongoing disruption of the economic space of the farm.</annotation>

He always drove out of the northern gate, and there by the gate was a stall, they could never keep that stall door closed. They had a farmhand who closed it once after it had sprung open. But one night, after he'd gone to bed, something came after the farmhand and it lifted his bed straight up to the rafters and crushed him quite hard. Then the farmhand shouted and asked them to stop lifting him up there. "No, you've tormented us, but now you'll die before we die." I heard that's how two farmhands were crushed to death.

    <annotation>Children were sent to the minister for religious instruction, particularly leading up to confirmation. Although the minister did not expect payment for this instruction, parents would give the minister produce and other farm goods as in kind payment--sometimes happily and other times quite begrudgingly. Accordingly, not all of these gifts were worth receiving, a fact that more often than not went unmentioned. Here, the minister confronts the congregation and brings into the open the less than generous nature of some of these gifts.</annotation>

    <annotation>The more common variant of this children's rhyme starts with "Ride, Ride Ranke," where Ranke is apparently the name of a knight (see Thiele 1818-1823, vol. 1, 159; and DS IV 489). The rhyme is usually sung while bouncing a child on one's knee. The rhyme is echoed in stories of the ghostly appearance of a dead lover (BJK 1.04; DS II G 219; DS II G 221). In those stories the work "ranke" appears as "rank" and means "upright" or "proper." Since in the game the child is often playfully dropped between ones legs at the end of the "ride," making it impossible for the child to remain "rank," this secondary reading of "rank/ranke" is also operative.</annotation>

    <annotation>Continuing in the vein of humorous dialect expressions from her preceding doggerel (AMJ 2.11), this personal experience narrative relies heavily on such expressions. Margrete may be providing context for dialect expressions that Tang Kristensen had asked her about. The story also reveals a conflict between propriety on the one hand (expressed here by the daughter) and actual practice (the mother drinking). This exchange is reminiscent of closing formula in fairy tales, particularly the comment, "They poured and I drank."  In the published version, Tang Kristensen adds the personal name Kirsten, and the familiar opening, "I ved nok..." (You probably know...), neither of which appears in the manuscript.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Maria sits on her knees with a group of girls, one in front of the other. One comes and asks the first: Where does Maria live? Next one back. To the next one. Just like that.

Endelig kommer han til Marie og sp&#xF6;rger liges&#xE5;. Her bor hun! svares med en Stemme, som tyder p&#xE5;, at hun ret har f&#xF8;lt Livets M&#xF6;je.

    <english_publication>The children line up in a row, one behind the other and hold on tightly to each other. The last one is Marie, and one is a suitor. He comes up to the first one and asks: Where does Marie live? It is answered: Next one back (or: In Bethlehem in David&#x2019;s city). He goes to the next one, and the same conversation takes place. Finally he comes to Marie and asks her just the same. She lives here! is answered with a voice that indicates that she has really experienced life&#x2019;s hardships. Then he asks: Can I have one of your daughters to dance with? That would be quite hard, since she indicates that she needs them to help her card, spin, weave, etc, so she can&#x2019;t do without her, but finally she says: If you promise me that she can get into heaven, then you can take her. He promises. Then the daughter comes up to the suitor with a tightly closed mouth, and he woos her in all sorts of ways, since it is all about getting to see her teeth. He asks how old she is, and she mumbles an answer, etc. If he manages to see her teeth, then she is going to hell, otherwise she&#x2019;ll go to heaven. That&#x2019;s how Marie gets rid of her daughters, one after the other, and they&#x2019;re sent either to heaven or to hell. When she&#x2019;s done with them, she is to go see her daughters. The ones that are in hell are having a really bad time, while the ones in heaven say: We&#x2019;re doing so well, so well. If the last one is a boy, he&#x2019;s not called Marie, but Joseph, and the suitor asks: Where does Joseph live? He asks him if he can have one of his boys to help him do carpentry work.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Like many games, this one includes a rhyme that helps govern the progression of the game. The game is commonly referred to as "Holde for Kongens Port" (Stop at the king's gate), and often starts with the first line, "Bro, bro brille." The game is played in a manner similar to the Anglo-American game, "London bridge is falling down," with the person caught in the middle compared to a sorry gray crow who is placed on a pike. In Denmark, after executions, the head of the victim was placed on a pike, and the game appears to refer to this earlier practice. The pike, usually a small pole in these games, also plays a central role in a well-documented form of tag similar to the Anglo-American "capture the flag."</annotation>

    <annotation>In this legend, Margrete returns to the theme of mound dwellers and other supernatural beings, in this case elves. Given the prevalence of mound folk in Margrete's repertoire, it is quite likely that she has conflated the two categories of supernatural beings. The description of the elves presented here is more in line with other descriptions of mound dwellers. In other legends, elves are presented as individualistic, seductive female figures, whose backs appear as hollowed out or rotten tree trunks (DS II A 50; DS II A 59). Elves do not generally appear as collective beings as they do here, a characteristic of the mound folk. Both Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter and Peder Johansen engage in a similar conflation of the categories of elves and mound dwellers (KMP 1.60; PJ 2.03).

     In this story, the elves disrupt the economic productivity of the farm by interfering with the boy's ability to look after the cattle (PJ 2.11). It is only through the quick intervention of the farmhand who, coincidentally, is also engaged in normal farm-based economic activity, that the boy is saved. The encounter with the elves marks the boy for the rest of his life, and underscores the continuing and potentially long-lasting danger that these supernatural beings pose. 

     The relationship Margrete draws between elves and alder wood builds on a common false etymology. The word Danish word for elves, elvefolk, is often pronounced ellefolk. The presumed root would link it to elletr&#xE6; (alder wood). The root of elvefolk actually derives from the old common Nordic root, &#xE1;lfr. As a result of the false etymology, elves are often linked to stands of alder wood in legend.</annotation>

    <annotation>Nisse is the Danish term for the guardian spirit of a farm. In Sweden, the same spirit is known as the tomte, and in Norway, the gardvord. The word nisse is a diminutive of the very common name Niels, and thus implies a small farmhand (Feilberg 2, 687). In her story, Margrete uses a common short form of the term, referring to the nisse as "nis."

     In her stories, Margrete emphasizes the economic aspects of the nisse's endeavors. The barter component of the first story should not be overlooked: in exchange for a relatively simple meal, the nisse insures a bountiful dairy output. (PJ 2.03). Nisse's seemingly excessive reaction the small portion of butter is in keeping with the extreme nature of these beings. 

     As with any out group transaction, value systems often do not align. A seemingly small transgression to an in group member may be quite significant to the out group, here represented by nisse. This differing value system is confirmed in the next two stories that also focus on the economics of the farm. In the first story, the nisse reveals his capacity for excess production, a form of wishful thinking on the part of farm workers. In the last of the three stories, the extreme reaction of the nisse confirms the frightening and potentially catastrophic misalignment of the human and the supernatural value systems. 

      The manner in which the farmhand dies echoes the death of another farmhand in one of Margrete's earlier ghost stories (AMJ 2.08). In the manuscript, there is a direct reference, missing in the published version, to Margrete's mother-in-law's ability to see ghosts. In this manner, Margrete proposes an intriguing connection between many of the supernatural beings that populate her stories and, in particular, the nisse and ghosts.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>My foster-mother was from Eg&#xE5; and served Niels Andersen there. There was a lot of haunting there and she could see that. There was also a nisse and he visited her many times. He said that she shouldn't be afraid of him, he wouldn't hurt her, because he noticed that she could see him. They always milked their cows out by an ash tree because that's where he had his house and so they always got more butter and milk. The farmer's wife was supposed to cook porridge for nis every day, and what he didn't finish he always used it to feed a horse. It was used to getting his left-overs. Then one day while they sat and milked, he came and knocked the milk away from the farmer's wife. "Sure, I know there wasn't enough butter in your porridge today, but if you'll leave me alone, I'll give you more butter tomorrow. I didn't have enough." He always went around and fed the horses, but one time they had a farmhand who wanted to lift him out of the stall. Then the nis says to him: "No, wait a moment, we have to go over there and get more oats for the horses." He got the farmhand to come with him to get more oats. The farmhand bound ten sheaves together, but nis took a shock (sixty sheaves) and tied them together. When they got half way, the farmhand wanted to rest. After they'd rested, the nis said, "If I'd known that we could rest, then I would have brought just as much more." When they got home, the farmhand was happy because now he'd gotten something to use for feed, and afterward nis could go and feed just as much as he wanted to. Then they got another farmhand, and he didn't want to let him go and do the feeding like that. He got lifted up in his bed and all the way up to the rafters, so he lay there dead when people got up the next morning.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Anders V&#xE6;ver acts the part of a guilty haunt. It is unclear whose money it is he is counting, but in the context of Margrete's other stories of solicitous, guilty haunts, it is fairly clear that the money represents ill-gotten gains. The death of his animals at the time of his death may be linked to the nisse and his loyalty to a single farm and single farmer. This resonates with one of Margrete's first stories, in which a farmhand mentions that the mound dweller would only work with him on a specific farm (AMJ 1.05). 

     The conjuring of Anders V&#xE6;ver proceeds without comment. Margrete endorses the common position of the minister as a successful ghost buster. That Anders himself possesses supernatural power goes without saying and may be part of the reason that he haunts. 

     The unusual phenomena that the men encounter when they try to steal Anders's apples are reminiscent of similar phenomena that distract people from successfully digging up buried treasure. In both cases, there is a suggestion that attempts to benefit economically without engaging in hard work are linked to the devil. Anders's willingness to wager with the men may also play a role in his subsequent haunting.

      In the published collections, this story is separated from the preceding one, despite the clear narrative connection apparent in the field diaries. In the published version, the order of events is reversed so that the story of Anders V&#xE6;ver's conjuring comes last, rather than first. The published version makes no mention of Anders V&#xE6;ver's nisse, the thread that connects these stories with the preceding ones.</annotation>

    <annotation>Foxes and pigs are unusual omens, while the liglam  (corpse lamb) is more widely attested. In normal situations, these animals are unremarkable but when they appear in unusual places or have unexpected characteristics as they do here, they represent a threat to individual well-being and, by extension, social and economic organization. 

      Margrete's father fortuitously escapes from the threatening animals, but Margrete provides no clear strategy for dealing with such encounters. She emphasized the role of the corpse lamb as an omen to a greater degree in this telling than in a version of the story she told five years later (AMJ 3.01).</annotation>

    <annotation>In these two closely linked legends, Margrete characterizes Puust-Maren (Puff-Maren) as a witch, a far more disruptive figure than the generally positive figure of the folk healer, who appears in the second story to restore order.

      In the first story, Puust-Maren launches an attack on the economic productivity of the manor farm, disrupting the farmhands' plowing. Furrows are often seen as efficacious against magic, but usually only when they are crossed (thereby inscribing a cross into the ground), rather than being followed as they are here. 

      The manor lord's actions are intriguing: he brings into the open Puust-Maren's abilities as a witch, but does not raise a formal accusation of witchcraft against her. Her actions could be seen as self incrimination, a form of testimony that was not allowed in the Danish witch trials that ended in the eighteenth century (Johansen 1991; Tangherlini 2000). This prohibition against self incrimination may also explain Puust-Maren's willingness to admit to having caused her daughter's deformity.

      The second story highlights another common belief about witches, namely their ability to cause illness. Certain methods, such as placing a broom at the threshold to the house, were seen as efficacious against the ability of the witch to gain entrance to a house. Strewing certain seeds, such as linseed at the threshold, could be similarly efficacious (DS V 1111). 

     The story may point toward the fierce competition that existed between local folk healers. Stories such as this could bolster the reputation of the successful folk healer, while casting aspersions on another. In this context, it is worth noting that one person's folk healer might be another person's witch (Muchembled 1979).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a woman in Skj&#xF8;dstrup, she was called Puust-Maren and she could witch and she could do so much magic. The man at Vosn&#xE6;sg&#xE5;rd had asked around about this, and so she comes down and was standing with him one day. "Listen, Maren," he says, "is it true that you know a lot of magic and can witch?" Maren: "Yes, that's true." Yes, it was. If she could make all his plows to stop at once, then he'd believe it. All his people were out in the fields plowing. Sure, that was an easy matter for her, she could stop all of them except for one, he knew a lot of magic himself, that farmhand, because as long as he was in the furrow, she couldn't do it, since he knew a lot of magic too. As soon as he got out of it, then she could. But the only way she could do it was to make the horses stampede, and the manor lord had to promise not to get angry, she couldn't do it without doing that to them as well. Then all the plows stopped except one. Something broke on all the farmhands' plows, some broke in the blade, some in the long iron, and for some the harnesses broke. When he came out at the end, the horses became so wild that they smashed the plow and they ran off across several fields and hurt the horses and everything. "Now I believe that you can, since you've done that to me. That was bad enough, but you won't be punished for it, but if you do it to others... I've heard tell about, like what you did to your daughter, you made her wing-mouthed because she wanted Per Virring." Yes, that was true enough. One time she'd also made a woman so sick and then another woman from Aarhus had to cure her because she was a bit wiser than Maren. But she couldn't do it unless the sick woman's husband would stand when Maren came--because she would come--and hit her in the forehead with a wooden club [n&#xF8;dde], otherwise the one from Aarhus couldn't do it. "But I'll probably kill her." "No, they couldn't kill her, it wouldn't even hurt." The man was afraid that she'd sneak in the door past him, but then the woman from Aarhus said that she'd put a birch broom [ruflime] or another kind of broom [sliklime] in the door, she knew that she couldn't go over that. Now when she was reading (the woman from Aarhus) and was curing the sick one, then Maren came and was so upset that it was dangerous and the man stood at the ready with the club and hit her as hard as he could and Maren didn't manage to do anything and had to go home. "I wouldn't have thought that there was such magic here," said Maren, "because then you could have let me known, and I could have cured her as well. But if I can't do anything else, well then she'll be wing-mouthed just like my daughter."</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Margrete performs a second and slightly fuller variant of "Holde for Kongens port" at the very end of the session (AMJ 2.14).  It is quite possible that during the course of the session she had remembered it. Her opening formula aligns better with other variants of the game, although her formulation "Bro, bro, brede", which means "Bridge, bridge, broad" differs from the more common "Bro, bro, brille", which means "Bridge, bridge, catch." In the more common version, the word brille is a form of the word bregle which means "to catch or to capture," and thus refers to the action of the game (Feilberg 1977 vol 1, 116-117). In the  field diaries, Tang Kristensen made several corrections for dialect pronunciation. In the penultimate line, the published version omits an "a" after "si", changing the meter of the line.</annotation>

Margrete's unusual pronunciation of the word furrow, fonen (AMJ 2.20) triggers this observation.

    <annotation>The role of lamb as a portent of death relies on an inversion: while a lamb usually represents renewal, birth and innocence (and is closely linked to the symbol of the lamb in Christianity), the lamb here represents death. Often, the corpse lamb is missing a leg and travels about only at night.

     This variant differs from the one Tang Kristensen collected from Margrete five years earlier (AMJ 2.19). Here we learn that Margrete's father was born on a holiday, a liminal time in the year, and this affords him second sight. The threat posed by the fox, a main component of the complicating action of the earlier variant, is missing from this variant, while the role of the corpse lamb as an omen for an impending death is more fully developed.</annotation>

    <annotation>Margrete's story of an infanticide and subsequent haunting aligns well with her other stories of guilty haunts. In this case, Margrete proposes that the local minister is the most competent to deal successfully with the disruptive force of the haunt.

     By the nineteenth century, infanticide was a relatively rare cause of death, possibly a result of the progressive policies enacted in the eighteenth century that were intended to prevent it. Infant mortality for the Danish countryside through the nineteenth century ranged from a low of 6% to a high of nearly 25% (L&#xF8;kke 2002). L&#xF8;kke notes that approximately 10% of all rural births were out of wedlock--this percentage fell in the latter parts if the century as legal reforms were enacted and rural economic organization was liberalized. In the last decades of the century, it was common practice for couples to marry after the birth of their first child.

     Executions in the early part of the century were often major events. Local soldiers surrounded the gallows to prevent people from getting too close to the spectacle (Steensberg 1964, 318). Capital punishment became less and less common during the course of the century. Christian V.'s Danske Lov, which was still in effect until 1866, allowed for the execution of a wide range of criminals, primarily to serve as examples for others. Earlier forms of execution and torture that included branding, dismemberment and the public display of the criminal's dismembered body, were abolished in 1833. Simple execution such as hanging was still allowed in the reformed law of 1866 for crimes such as murder and crimes against the state. The death penalty was not abolished in Denmark until the punishment reform law of 1930.</annotation>

    <annotation>The execution of the mother by hanging in the preceding story (AMJ 3.02) resonates with the suicide in this story. The minister, as in the earlier variant, is presented as a wise minister (klog pr&#xE6;st), a figure balanced on the fine line between the ecclesiastic and spiritual function of a minister on the one hand, and the more questionable realm of magic on the other hand.

     Five years earlier, Margrete had told another version of this same story (AMJ 1.06). This variant diverges little from the earlier telling. Margrete provides slightly more detail about the suicide, such as his name and the location of the hanging. The direct speech between the minister and the wife is also slightly different, although in both cases it concerns the certainty of the dead man "getting in" to Heaven.</annotation>

    <annotation>These stories continue Margrete's retelling of stories she had told Tang Kristensen in her first two meetings with him (AMJ 2.17). Margrete adds the personal connection to Anders V&#xE6;vers's nisse, in the guise of her stepmother who, like her father, was born on a calendrically liminal day, in this case Christmas. In this telling, Margret attributes the protection of the apple orchard to the nisse rather than to Anders V&#xE6;ver. 

     The animals that the nisse sends to distract the thieves are reminiscent of the animals that appear during quests for buried treasure, and help link the nisse more definitively to the demonic (PJ 2.10). The nisse apparently takes the family's wealth away after Anders dies. 

     Anders's haunt is described more explicitly here than in the earlier variant as a guilty haunt. Unlike other stories that Margrete tells in which the solicitous guilty haunt is confronted, this haunt is never confronted. Rather than the positive resolutions that mark her legends in which haunts are confronted or conjured, the resolution of this story is decidedly negative: Anders's farm is laid waste and his children end up destitute.</annotation>

    <annotation>This legend is widely attested, and Tang Kristensen includes well over fifty variants of the legend in his published collections of Danske sagn. Str&#xF6;mb&#xE4;ck, in his study of the tale, identifies three subtypes (1958). The destruction of the church at night may be linked to the mound dwellers. Other typical church destroyers are trolls and giants. The use of oxen to find the building site (in some variants, the oxen are tied to the building materials) relies on several inversions of the normal order. The infertility of the oxen stands in contradistinction to the communal elements of the church. Also, allowing oxen to roam free and, in other variants, at night, runs counter to normal roles for domesticated animals: their grazing is usually limited and they are not used productively at night. Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter also told a variant of the legend (KMP 1.18).</annotation>

    <annotation>The Danish word for "tax" and "treasure" are the same, and the nine year treasure the dragon guards is likely a treasure that has been collected from nine years of taxation. At the end of the nineteenth century, taxation was a hot button topic in political debate, and there was significant discussion over the degree to which taxes should be administered locally or should be returned to the central administration of the national government. With the constitution, the Crown was less in control of tax revenue as it had been during the period of the absolute monarchy.

     Dragons guarding treasures are known in Nordic tradition back through the middle ages. Grundtvig's translations of Snorri and Saxo made such stories broadly accessible in rural Denmark. Perhaps the best known of the medieval dragons guarding treasure is Fafnir, who turns himself into a dragon to protect a hoard of ill-gotten gold.

     Tang Kristensen misrecorded the name of the castle, as there is no castle on Kalv&#xF8; (near Skanderborg). Cistercian monks had used Kalv&#xF8;, but left no structure that could be considered a castle. Given the next story, it is clear that Margrete was referring to the nearby Kal&#xF8; castle, which had been built in the late middle ages, and was used sporadically through the nineteenth century. It was here that Christian II imprisoned Gustav Wasa the future king of Sweden from 1518 to 1522.</annotation>

It is unclear what the passage would have been used for: perhaps Royal visitation with mistresses, or perhaps the movement of riches. Whatever the case, the secret passage can be seen as a representation of the popular perception of the aristocracy and the royal family as secretive and deceptive.</annotation>

    <annotation>Margrete provides the details here for acquiring a genie, most likely a servant of Satan, or Satan himself. All of the components of the process rely on inversions of the normal order, all ultimately for personal gain. 

     Thursdays appear frequently as a liminal day, the last day of the week that is not charged with any religious significance (Friday was traditionally a day of fasting in preparation for the Sabbath, although such practice was in decline already from the beginning of the Reformation). Peat, a common fuel for heating, is not supposed to be dug at midnight. In fact no activity is supposed to take place at this late hour outside the farm at all, and certainly not in the middle of an intersection, where it would disrupt traffic. The intersection forms a cross, and thus should have religious power, but here it is used in a non-religious, or perhaps even anti-religious fashion. Toads are generally seen as connected to Satan and witches, even though they can also be considered good luck omens. Toads figure prominently as ingredients in various magical potions, as is the case here. Attending church at midnight and blowing through the keyhole are two common ways to come into contact with Satan. 

     The genie resonates with Margrete's folktale about the genie in the bottle (AMJ 2.02), although in this story the genie has a more ominous origin, and does not derive from a normal, albeit somewhat questionable, economic transaction. 

     Oddly, the published version does not include the motif of burying the toad in the peat stack.</annotation>

    <annotation>Margrete continues her discussion of magically efficacious flora and fauna. Seeds gathered at calendrically liminal periods, such as Saint Hans, a summer solstice celebration, are considered to be magically powerful. Bracken seeds were generally considered to be associated with witchcraft (BJK 3.12). Bracken, or ferns, do not actually produce seeds, but rather produce spores. Another magical seed is linseed, used to prevent the passage of witches (DS V 1111 and DS IV 744). The written piece of paper to which Margrete alludes was a common feature in magical practice. The most complete magical writings are found in compendia of magic verses, incantations and directions known as Cyprianus. These books were mostly in the possession of cunning folk and not witches. 

      Margrete does not seem overly concerned about her failure to collect any seeds, and there is a hint that she did not believe that her companion was successful either.

     The published version changes the order of the wording slightly, moving the identification of Margrete's companion to the beginning of the account.</annotation>

    <annotation>Margrete raises the very real problem of infant mortality, a phenomenon studied in detail by L&#xF8;kke (2002). Her interactions with the landlord reflect the often harsh conditions that confronted those who were forced to rent, rather than own, their own lodgings. By the 1840s, the potential for abuse represented by the rented houses (lejehuse) had become a major issue in the peasant movement. In a communication with Grundtvig, for example, Peter R&#xF8;rdam (1806-1883), minister in Mern, insisted that the practice be abolished entirely. The problems with finding and keeping suitable housing resonate with Margrete's proverbial expression (AMJ 1.09) and a fairy tale (AMJ 2.02) she had performed five years earlier.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Pale with fright. When I lived in a house out in the woods Haarup-Krannestrup, there was a viper in our bed at night. My little boy Martinus lay one night and was really agitated. I though that he wanted to pee and reached out for him but grabbed the snake. I got up and got the kids out of the bed and brought it out into the kitchen and killed it. I think it had gotten to the boy, because he'd been sick for three days, and he could otherwise eat a lot in those days. Then that was gone. That was the first Sunday after Saint Hans, but then in September, I had my son Kristian. He lived to be only twenty weeks old and then he died of the shakes (cramps), and it was probably because of what came over me that night. The man who owned the house came the next day and I showed him the snake. Oh shit, I've lain between both grass snakes and vipers, are you scared of that? I was pale with fright and said that I wouldn't continue to live in that house.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>This story, a variant of ATU 302, "The Ogre's (Devil's) Heart in the Egg", is one of Margrete's longest fairy tales and reveals her impressive ability as a storyteller. Intriguingly, the story is told in the first person from the perspective of a man. This choice of narrator underscores the fictional nature of the account. 

     Several of the characters resonate with other stories in Margrete's repertoire: the boy's acquisition of magical abilities parallels the boy who learns the three crafts; and the antagonists (the mound man and the dragon) appear in many of Margrete's legends. 

     Mikkelr&#xE6;v, or Michael Fox, is a well-known trickster figure in Danish fairy tales, but here he plays little more than a helper figure role. Hunt privileges in the forests were strictly limited to large landowners, a privilege that became a point of contention in the years after the constitutional reform. Not all nobility and royals were in agreement on their absolute right to hunting privileges and King Frederik VII (1848-1863) gave up his exclusive privileges to the hunt on all royal lands, a gesture that endeared him greatly to the rural populations. The laws governing hunting rights were changed in 1851, eliminating the formerly exclusive rights to the hunt that had accrued to the nobility and royalty.

     The moves in this active masculine tale closely follow those detailed by Holbek (1987,  432). Amusingly, the story does not end with the "happily ever after" formula, but rather ends with the hero/narrator flying off to join the geese, only to be deposited back in poverty and the real world.     

     The fair copy version is far more detailed than the manuscript version. Events have been expanded, and occasional plot points have been altered such as the fight with the dragon near the end of the tale, and the early interactions between the young man and the princess in her castle.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>When I was out doing my last inspection, Michael Fox came up to me and asked me if I couldn't carry him a bit in my shoulder bag, because the hunters wanted to shoot him. Then he'd grant me three promises. I could turn myself into an ant, into a lion and into a duck and after we'd gone a little bit the dogs come running after me too and then the hunters come too. They said that I must have some fresh slaughtered meat in my bag. Then I said that I didn't have anything other than the rags that I couldn't sell or get anything for, and I certainly was allowed to have whatever I wanted to in my bag, and would they please call their dogs off. See then they called their dogs off and then when I'd gone a little farther, Michael said to me that I could let him go now, because now there wasn't any danger anymore. When he'd left, I wanted to try if there was anything to these promises and so I turned myself into an ant first, but it didn't go far down the road. So I turned myself into a duck and flew so far, so far away to another kingdom and I fell down there right in front of the princess's windows and she had never before seen such a beautiful bird. She opened the window and put some rusks in the windowsill, and I was so hungry and a duck and then she placed the rusks on the table and I went in. She slams the window shut. Not the first but the next night, I wanted to try to lie with her and turned myself into a man. She shouted: Father, father, there is a man with me. He came in there. So I turned myself into an ant and went under the bed. So they couldn't find me. She'd dreamt it. Same way for three nights. Then the king said that if she called him again, she'd be punished. If she wouldn't keep quiet. Then she talked to me. It continued like this for a while. One day the king came in there and she said to him that she wanted to have that bird. You already have it. But I want to have it as my husband. A strange husband. He can also turn himself into a man. I turn myself into a man, and stood there and talked with them. Well, since you can do so much, then you can bring home the princess that the mound dweller took several years ago, then you can have her. Well, I didn't know about that. So I had to go out and wander again with my shoulder bag on my back. I came to an inn, they were sitting and talking about this mound dweller, and I learned there where the mountain was. I turned myself into an ant, and crawled down there. She was home alone. The mound man was out. Jesus Christ, how did you get in here. Well, I... You're unlucky. In the first room, there was a closet with so many human skulls in it, in the second, a closet with so much clothes, and in the third, so many dead bodies lay. When you go to bed tonight, you are to ask him where his heart is, since he can kill so many people. Then he'll say there is Christian blood in here. You should answer he knows that you are Christian. You have to leave now. No, I'll put myself under the bed in the shape of an ant, I want to hear how he answers you. Then the mound man came and they had their dinner and went to bed. Asks him where his heart was. Ugh, there is Christian blood in here. You know that I'm Christian. He gets up and looked in all the rooms. Back into bed again. My heart, no one can get that, it is inside an egg, and that's in a duck, and that's in a fox, and that is in a dragon, and that is at a manor farm and if they don't get it seven fat swine each weekday, it will destroy the land and kingdom. Then I crept up out of the mountain again, and I went to the manor farm and the manor lord. Didn't he need a farmhand. Yes, a swineherd since the dragon laid waste to so many of his herdsmen. When the swine weren't fat enough. You probably don't want to be that. Sure, I can probably lay waste to him. The first day, a Monday, I was to go out, I got seven fat swine to drive. To the dragon. Good day, Dragon. Thank you. Are you to have these. Yes, that's what I've gotten each weekday. Let's fight for them. I turned myself into a lion and then we fight. If only he'd had one of those swine, then he would have torn me into such small pieces that they wouldn't have been able to pick all of me up in eight days. If I'd had a bite of bread and a dram, then I would have torn him into pieces so small it would be as if he'd been crushed in a mill. Then I won the swine and came back to the manor lord with them. The manor lord was worried and scared that the dragon would destroy his land and kingdoms. It's good for him to go hungry a bit, I'm a strong young man. The next Monday, the manager was to come along to see how things went. I had fourteen because the manor lord was afraid of keeping them. Good day, Dragon. Thank you... lion... fight... third Monday twenty-one... Manager a bite of bread and a dram along to give me when I asked for it. Then I won the twenty-one fat swine. Then I ripped the dragon to death and a fox came out. Tore apart. Duck flew out and sat down on a stone in the sea. I turn myself into a duck and flew out after it. Tore apart. Egg to the bottom of the ocean. I go down after it, and then I got my shoulder sack and the egg in it. The manor lord wanted to give me so much but I wasn't too interested, and I set off to get back to the mound man. He was lying on top and was so sick. Oh dear God, is it you that has my heart? Yes. Oh, can't I have it back? Yes, if you'll send the princess you have down there with you back to land just as nice and healthy as when you took her. Yes, he'd certainly do that. Then he went down and got her and she came to land. Followed her home to her father and they were all so happy when I came with her, that it was almost dangerous and I was now to have the princess and half the kingdom immediately, and the other half when the king died. But God have mercy, those who have a lot want even more. The eighth day, I stood looking out over the castle, and I saw a flock of wild geese. I turned myself into a duck and flew up and wanted to have them, but then they grabbed onto me, and they flew with me to the third B&#xE6;rmose  and then I fell down and that's how I came here and could tell you this lie.</english_manuscript>

Ja-a, han kunde ogsaa skabe sig til Karl. &#x201D;Det var noget,&#x201D; siger Kongen, og i det samme gj&#xF8;r a mig til Karl, og staar og snakker med dem. &#x201D;Ja, naar du kan saa meget,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;saa kan du skaffe den Prinsesse hjem, som Bj&#xE6;rgmanden har taget for nogle Aar siden, og naar du kommer med hende, saa skal du faa min Datter.&#x201D; Ja, det vidste a ikke, om a turde tage mig paa. Jo, det skulde a, nu var Kongen bleven opsat paa det, og saa maa a ud at vandre igjen med min Tv&#xE6;rs&#xE6;k paa min Nakke. Endelig kom a til en Kro, hvor de sad og snakkede om den Bj&#xE6;rgmand, og der fik a at vide, hvor Bj&#xE6;rget var. A kom derhen, skabte mig i en Myre, og kr&#xF8;b derned. Lige i Tiden var Prinsessen enlig hjemme, Bj&#xE6;rgmanden var et sted henne, hvor det var. &#x201D;J&#xF8;s Kors hvordan er du kommen her ind?&#x201D; siger hun. &#x2013; Ja, a var da kommen her. &#x201D;Aa, du er ulykkelig,&#x201D; siger hun, &#x201D;du kommer aldrig levende herfra,&#x201D; og saa viste hun mig ind i det f&#xF8;rste V&#xE6;relse, der stod et Skab med saa mange Menneskehoveder i. Dern&#xE6;st kom a ind i det andet V&#xE6;relse, der stod et Skab med saa mange Kl&#xE6;der i, og endelig kom a ind i det tredje hvor der laa saa mange d&#xF8;de Kroppe. Saa siger a til hende: &#x201D;Naar han nu kommer hjem, og du kommer i Seng i Aften, saa skal du sp&#xF8;rge ham hvor hans Hj&#xE6;rte er, for han maa da ikke have det med sig, siden han kan undlive saa mange.&#x201D; Ja, det skulde hun nok. Saa vil han vel nok sige: &#x201D;Der er Kristenblod herinde, men du skal svare ham han ved nok, du er en Kristen.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, du maa afsted nu,&#x201D; siger Prinsessen til mig og er saa angst. &#x201D;Nej, a s&#xE6;tter mig under Sengen i en Myre, for a vil h&#xF8;re hvad han svarer dig.&#x201D; Naa, saa kom Bj&#xE6;rgmanden, og de fik deres Aftensmad, og kom saa i Seng. Saa sp&#xF8;rger hun ham, hvor hans Hj&#xE6;rte var. "Du maa jo ikke have det ved dig, siden du kan undlive saa mange.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Fyfy, der er Kristenblod her inde,&#x201D; siger han. &#x201D;Aa, du ved nok, a er en Kristen,&#x201D; siger hun. Men det vilde han ikke give sig tilfreds med, og han op, og de ledte i alle V&#xE6;relserne. Men de fandt jo ingen Ting, og han maa til at i Seng igien. Hun sp&#xF8;rger atter om, hvor hans Hj&#xE6;rte var. &#x201D;Mit Hj&#xE6;rte, det kan ingen faa, det er inden i et &#xC6;g, og det &#xC6;g er i en And, og den And er i en R&#xE6;v, og den er inden i en Drage, og den Drage er ved en Herregaard. Hvis de ikke skaffer dem syv fede Svin hver Ugedag, saa l&#xE6;gger den Lande og Rige &#xF8;de.&#x201D; Den Gang a havde nu h&#xF8;rt det, saa kr&#xF8;b a op paa Bj&#xE6;rget igien, og a rejste af hen til den Herregaard. A kommer til Herremanden og sp&#xF8;rger ham, om han tr&#xE6;ngte ingen Karle for. Jo, han tr&#xE6;ngte for en Svinhyrde, for der var en Drage, der lagde saa mange Hjorder &#xF8;de for ham. Det gjorde han, naar Svinene var ikke fede nok, som han skulde have. &#x201D;Men den Bestilling vil du vel ikke gj&#xE6;rne have.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Jo, det er mig det samme,&#x201D; siger a, &#x201D;a kan nok l&#xE6;gge ham &#xF8;de.&#x201D; Naa ja, saa kom a i Pladsen. Den f&#xF8;rste Dag, a skulde ud med Svinene, det var en Mandag, og a fik syv fede Svin at drive med. Saa kommer a til Dragen. &#x201D;God Dag, Drage,&#x201D; siger a. &#x201D;Tak,&#x201D; siger han. &#x201D;Skal du have dine fede Svin?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, de har a faaet hver Ugedag.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Det vil vi slaas om,&#x201D; siger a, og saa skaber a mig i en L&#xF8;ve og slaas med ham. Endelig siger han: Gud a havde haft et af de fede Svin, saa skulde a have revet dig saa smaa, de kunde ikke have samlet dig op i otte Dage.&#x201D; A bad til, a havde haft en Bid Br&#xF8;d og en Dram, saa skulde a have reven ham saa smaa, som han var m&#xF8;llemaald. Saa gav han tabt, og a vandt Svinene og kom hjem til Herremanden med dem. Han var s&#xF8;rgen og r&#xE6;d for Dragen, te den vild l&#xE6;gge Lande og Riger &#xF8;de for ham, som den havde truet med, men a var jo frisk Karl og viste ham Svinene. &#x201D;Han har godt af at sulte noget,&#x201D; siger a. Den n&#xE6;ste Mandag skulde Forvalteren med for at se, hvordan det gik til. Da havde a fjorten fede Svin med, for Herremanden var bange for at beholde dem. Saa kom den og var ikke saa meget god. &#x201D;God Dag Drage,&#x201D; siger a. &#x201D;Tak,&#x201D; siger den. &#x201D;Skal du have dine fede Svin?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, den kan a nok tr&#xE6;nge til.&#x201D;  &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det vil vi slaas om,&#x201D; og a gj&#xF8;r mig til en L&#xF8;ve og slaas paa Liv og D&#xF8;d med ham. Der falder nu den sammen snak imellem os, og det stod Forvalteren jo og h&#xF8;rte paa. Endelig blev Dragen kjed af at slaas med mig, og saa drog a hjem med mine svin. Men Herremanden kunde endnu ikke rigtig falde i Ro og han vilde have, a skulde drage af med 21 Svin den n&#xE6;ste Mandag. Forvalteren skulde med, og han skulde have en Bid Br&#xF8;d og en Dram med at fly mig, naar a forlangte det. Vi kom saa til at slaas for tredje Gang, og da vi havde slaas paa Liv og D&#xF8;d en Tid, saa siger Dragen: &#x201D;Gid a havde haft et af de fede Svin, saa skulde a have reven dig saa smaa, de kunde ikke have samlet dig op i otte Dage.&#x201D; Men a sagde; &#x201D;Havde a nu en Bid Br&#xF8;d og en Dram, saa skulde a rive dig saa smaa, som du var m&#xF8;llemaald.&#x201D; Strags springer Forvalteren til og jager det i mig, og saa tog a fat igjen og fik Magt med Dragen, saa nu havde a vundet de 21 fede Svin. A rev Dragen ihjel, og saa kom der en R&#xE6;v ud. Den rev a ogsaa ihjel, og saa fl&#xF8;j der en And ud af den og satte sig paa en Sten i Havet. A gj&#xF8;r mig i en And og flyver ud efer den. A river den ihjel, og saa falder der et &#xC6;g ud, og det falder til Havsens Bund. A ned efter det, og saa fik a &#xC6;gget i min Tv&#xE6;rs&#xE6;k og rejser af tilbage til Herremanden. Han vilde have givet mig saa meget, for det a havde frelst ham fra Dragen, men det br&#xF8;d a mig ikke om, a satte efter at komme tilbage til Bj&#xE6;rget. Da a kom der, laa han ovenpaa og var saa syg. &#x201D;Aa Herre G...,&#x201D; siger han, &#x201D;er det dig, der har mit Hj&#xE6;rte?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Ja, det er.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Aa, maa a da ikke faa det?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201D;Jo, naar du vil fly den Prinsesse i Land, du har her nede ved dig, og det lige saa from og lige saa sund, som da du tog hende.&#x201D; Jo, det skulde han nok. Saa gik han ned og hent hende og hun kom i Land. Nu fulgte hun med mig hjem til hendes Faders Land, og der blev saadan Gl&#xE6;de, da a kom med hende, saa det var farligt. A skulde nu have Prinsessen og det halve Kongerige strags, og det andet halve, naar Kongen d&#xF8;de. Men Gud bedre det, dem, der har meget, de vil have mere. Den ottende Dag efter Brylluppt stod a og saa ud over Slottet, og der saa a en Flok Vilgj&#xE6;s. A skabte mig saa i en And og fl&#xF8;j op og vilde have dem, men saa kom a imellem T&#xF8;mmen af dem, og de fl&#xF8;j med mig til tredje B&#xE6;rmose, og saa faldt a ned. Derfor kom a hertil og kunde fort&#xE6;lle jer den L&#xF8;gn.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>When I was out doing my last inspection, Michael Fox came up to me and asked me if I couldn&#x2019;t carry him a bit in my shoulder bag, because the hunters wanted to shoot him, and he&#x2019;d give me three promises, and they were that I could turn myself into an ant, into a lion and into a duck. After we&#x2019;d gone a little bit, the dogs came running after me, and behind them the hunters came too. They said that I must have some freshly slaughtered meat in my bag, but I said that I didn&#x2019;t have anything other than the rags that I couldn&#x2019;t sell or get anything for, and I certainly was allowed to have whatever I wanted to in my bag, and would they please call their dogs off. See, then they called their dogs off and then when I&#x2019;d gone a little farther, Michael said to me that I could let him go now because there wasn&#x2019;t any danger anymore. When he&#x2019;d gotten out of my bag and run off, I wanted to test if there was anything to these promises he&#x2019;d given me. I turned myself into an ant first and that went well enough. But I didn&#x2019;t get far down the road running there like an ant, so I turned myself into a duck and flew so far, so far away until I came to another kingdom. I fell down right in front of the princess&#x2019;s windows and she saw me and had never before seen such a beautiful bird. She opened the window and put some rusks in the windowsill, and I was so hungry that I started to eat them. She placed the rusks on the table and I flew in. Then she slammed the window shut, and now I was inside with her. The first day I stayed a bird, but then the next night I wanted to try to lie with her and so I turned myself into a man again. She shouted: &#x201C;Father, father, there is a man here in my room!&#x201D; and he came running in there, but I immediately turned myself into an ant and went under the bed. Now they couldn&#x2019;t find me, and then the king said that she&#x2019;d dreamed it. I did the same thing the third night. She called for her father and he came, but I was an ant and sat under the bed. Then the king said that if she tricked him again, she&#x2019;d be punished because he didn&#x2019;t want to be called like that anymore. Then after I&#x2019;d turned myself into a man again and she noticed that I was there, she talked to me and we got to know each other well. It continued like this for a while. One day when the king had come in there, she said to him, &#x201C;I want to have that bird.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;You already have it,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Yes, but I want to have it as my husband.&#x201D; &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a strange husband,&#x201D; says the king. &#x201C;Yes, well he can also turn himself into a man.&#x201D; &#x201C;That&#x2019;s something,&#x201D; says the king, and at that moment, I turn myself into a man, and stood there and talked with them. &#x201C;Well, since you can do so much,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;then you can bring home the princess that the mound dweller took several years ago, and when you come with her, you&#x2019;ll get my daughter.&#x201D; Well, I didn&#x2019;t know if I dared take on that task. Yes, I had to, now the king had gotten set on that, and so I had to go out and wander again with my shoulder bag on my back. Finally I came to an inn where they were sitting, talking about this mound dweller, and I learned where the mountain was. I got out there, turned myself into an ant, and crawled down there. Right at that time, the princess was home alone, the mound man was somewhere else, wherever it was. &#x201C;Jesus Christ, how did you get in here?&#x201D; she says. Yes, I&#x2019;d come here. &#x201C;Oh, you&#x2019;re unlucky,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;you&#x2019;ll never get out of here alive,&#x201D; and then she showed me into the first room, there was a closet there with lots and lots of human skulls in it. Next I came into the second room, there was a closet with lots and lots of clothes, and finally I came into the third room where there were lots and lots of dead bodies lying about. Then I say to her, &#x201C;Now when he comes home, and you go to bed tonight, you are to ask him where his heart is, because he can&#x2019;t have it with him, since he can kill so many people.&#x201D; Yes, she&#x2019;d certainly do that. Then he&#x2019;ll probably say, &#x201C;There is Christian blood in here, but you should answer him that he knows darn well that you are Christian.&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, you have to leave now,&#x201D; says the Princess to me and is so worried. &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;ll put myself under the bed in the shape of an ant, because I want to hear how he answers you.&#x201D; Well, then the mound man came and they had their dinner and went to bed. Then she asks him where his heart was. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t have it with you, since you can kill so many people.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ugh, there is Christian blood in here,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Oh, you know darn well that I&#x2019;m Christian,&#x201D; she says. But he wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with that, and he gets up, and they looked in all the rooms. But they didn&#x2019;t find anything, and he had to go back to bed. She asks him again where his heart was. &#x201C;My heart, no one can get that, it is inside an egg, and the egg is inside a duck, and that duck is inside a fox, and that is inside a dragon, and that dragon is at a manor farm. If they don&#x2019;t give it seven fat swine each weekday, it will destroy the land and kingdom.&#x201D; When I&#x2019;d heard that, I climbed up out of the mountain again, and I went off to the manor farm. I go up to the manor lord and ask him if he didn&#x2019;t need a farmhand. Yes, he certainly needed a farmhand since there was a dragon that laid waste to so many of his herdsmen. He did that whenever the swine he was to have weren&#x2019;t fat enough. &#x201C;But you probably don&#x2019;t want to have that job.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Sure, it&#x2019;s all the same to me,&#x201D; I say, &#x201C;I can probably lay waste to him.&#x201D; OK, so I got the job. The first day I was to go out with the swine, and I was given seven fat swine to drive. Then I get to the dragon, &#x201C;Good day, Dragon,&#x201D; I say. &#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Are you to have these fat swine?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve gotten each weekday.&#x201D; &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s fight for them,&#x201D; I say, and then I turn myself into a lion and then I fight him. Finally he says, &#x201C;If only I&#x2019;d had one of those swine, then I would have torn you into such small pieces that they wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to pick all of you up even in eight days.&#x201D; And I said that if I&#x2019;d had a bite of bread and a dram, then I would have torn him into pieces so small it would be as if he&#x2019;d been crushed in a mill. Then he gave in, and I won the swine and came home to the manor lord with them. He was afraid of the dragon and was worried that he&#x2019;d destroy his land and kingdoms like he&#x2019;d threatened, but I was a fit young man and showed him the swine. It&#x2019;s good for him to go hungry a bit, I say. The next Monday, the manager was to come along to see how things went. I had fourteen fat swine with me, because the manor lord was afraid of keeping them. &#x201C;Good day, Dragon,&#x201D; I say. &#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; it says. &#x201C;Do you want these fat swine?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, I could certainly use them.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Sure, let&#x2019;s fight for them,&#x201D; and I turn myself into a lion and we fight for life and death over them. We have the same conversation and the manager stood there and listened to that. Finally, the dragon got tired of fighting with me, and then I went home with my swine. But the manor lord still couldn&#x2019;t settle down, and he wanted me to go off with twenty-one swine the next Monday. The manager was to come with me, and he was to bring a bite of bread and a dram to give me when I asked for it. We started fighting for the third time, and after we&#x2019;d fought for life and death for a while, the dragon says, &#x201C;If only I&#x2019;d had one of those swine, then I would have torn you into such small pieces that they wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to pick all of you up even in eight days.&#x201D; But I said: &#x201C;If I had a bite of bread and a dram, then I&#x2019;d tear you into pieces so small it would be as if you'd been crushed in a mill.&#x201D; The manager immediately jumps in and stuffs it in me, and then I went to it again and got power over the dragon, so now I&#x2019;d won the twenty-one fat swine. I tore the dragon to pieces and killed him, and then a fox came out. I tore that one apart and killed it too, and then a duck flew out and sat down on a stone in the sea. I turn myself into a duck and flew out after it. I tear it to pieces and kill it, and then an egg falls out, and it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. I go down after it, and then I got the egg in my shoulder sack and go back to the manor lord. He wanted to give me so much, since I&#x2019;d saved him from the dragon, but I wasn&#x2019;t too interested, and I set off to get back to the mountain. When I got there, he [the mound dweller] was lying on top of it and was so sick. &#x201C;Oh dear God...,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;is it you that has my heart?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, it is.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh, can&#x2019;t I have it back?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, if you&#x2019;ll send the princess you have down there with you back to land, and just as nice and healthy as when you took her.&#x201D; Yes, he&#x2019;d certainly do that. Then he went down and got her and she came to land. Then she followed me home to her father&#x2019;s land, and they were all so happy when I came with her, that it was almost dangerous. I was now to have the princess and half the kingdom immediately, and the other half when the king died. But God have mercy, those who have a lot want even more. The eighth day after the wedding, I stood looking out over the castle, and I saw a flock of wild geese. I turned myself into a duck and flew up and wanted to have them, but then they grabbed on to me, and they flew with me to the third B&#xE6;rmose (B&#xE6;r swamp) and then I fell down. That&#x2019;s how I came here and could tell you this lie.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Fittingly, Margrete concludes her contact with Tang Kristensen by singing one of the ballads that she had first sung to him (AMJ 1.02). This version is shorter than the earlier one. References to the father's gilded lyre are replaced by a reference to his gilded carriage, suggesting that perhaps this is what she had meant all along (Tang Kristensen had interpolated the lyre as the referent in the earlier variant).  Master Ridebold is still sentenced to 12,000 wounds, but in the manuscript, Margrete simply mentions that he rides home to die. Gulenborg, in contrast, rides to Rosenholm. In the published version, Tang Kristensen made Margrete's performance more consistent, sending Gulenborg to Klavsholm (Clausholm), even though there is no mention of that castle in the field diaries.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>He came in to her and she stood coming her hair

Master Ridenbold came riding into the King&#x2019;s courtyard
    |: Out in L&#xF8;ndom
There stands proud Gulenborg and comes her hair
   |: That happened in my youth
And if you want to marry me

First he saddled the gold and then the grey
he puts proud Gulenborg on the best one

And then they rode so heavily out into Rosenros

Now I hear my father&#x2019;s bridle posts clanging
Now I hear my father&#x2019;s gilded wagon

And listen proud Gulenborg hold onto my horse
do not name my name

Then he slay the 12000 men including her father
(And) that was my dear father you killed

He got a wound for each man he killed
He was sentenced to 12000 wounds.
Then he rode home and died there. She traveled to Rosenholm and they say that it was built for her. They were both children of kings. The 12000 wounds on Master Ridebold were sentenced.

    <annotation>The last of Margrete's fairy tales is a fragment. Although the tale has an implicit conclusion, namely the wedding of the girl and the bewitched tom cat (probably a prince given that his parents live in a castle), the tale is missing almost all of the development of characters and plot characteristics of her other fairy tales. Holbek would classify this tale as one with an active feminine heroine, given the role of the young girl in the tale and the bewitched nature of the prince (Holbek 1987, 433). It is most likely that Tang Kristensen asked if she knew anything else, perhaps another fairy tale or ballad, and this is what she could remember.</annotation>

    <publication_info>DS_IV_1517</publication_info>
    <annotation>This story straddles the generic divide between folktale and legend. Although the tale at first blush seems believable, the manor lord's eventual slaughter of the beggars-turned-robbers brings to mind tales cataloged as ATU 956, "The Hot Chamber in the House of Robbers", and its close analogs (ATU 956a and b).

      The story has two distinct parts: The first part deals with the vengeful nature of Klaus and his family after they have been put off their farm. The second part deals with the attack on the farm by the "robbers" and the manor lord's strength and ability to protect the farmers in his district.

     Peder addresses several critical issues in this the first story that he told Tang Kristensen. The parceling of farms after the land reforms of 1780 led to a significant increase in the number of farms and houses that were no longer leaseholds. After the reorganization of the fields, many people discovered that, despite the proximity of their fields to their neighbors, the fields could be of greatly differing quality. 

     The parceling of lands also required that people, long used to a different mode of existence, were now forced to confront the demands of self sufficiency and the rough and tumble of a free market economy (Christiansen 1996 and 1975). In some cases, farmers were unable to keep up with the demands of the new economic structures, and ultimately were forced off their land. Those vacated farms were either offered to new farmers or bought out by neighbors. 

     At the time when Peder told this story, care of the poor and the causes of poverty were subjects of great currency in local political debates. Most people agreed that there were two classes of paupers: those who deserved help since they were poor through no fault of their own (advanced age, poverty, feebleness), and those who did not deserve help since they were poor by choice (drunks, able-bodied poor, freeloaders) (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940). Legislation after the 1860s recognized these different classes of poor. Those who could work but chose not to were often forced onto labor farms (fattigg&#xE5;rde) (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940). In Peder's story, the family which is too lazy to work is first thrown off their land, and later executed.

     Peder also addresses the problem of beggars and vagabonds in this story, a problem that animates Kirsten Marie Pedersdatter's storytelling. In Peder's story, the lazy farmer and his family become wandering craftsmen. An alternate reading is that they are simply masquerading as potters and are actually earning their keep as thieves. The later reference to them as "robbers" suggests this reading may be more accurate. In either case, the implication that wandering merchants were shifty characters aligns well with much of the debate concerning care for the poor and legislation aimed at stemming the tide of rural begging and wandering (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940).  

     The strategy that Poul and his hired girl adopt to eliminate the threat posed by Klaus and his sons has a fairly harsh outcome. The "one that got away" allows for the threat to persist, and resists a positive resolution.

      Paradoxically, the return of Klaus's family, now robbers, is heralded by another wanderer. The warning comes as repayment for Poul's previously generous and merciful treatment of that wanderer. Many rural communities encouraged legislation that relied on the goodwill of the population, rather than the burden of additional taxes, to provide for the poor. A story such as this would, of course, provide grist for the rhetorical mill supporting that policy.

     The manor lord's protection of the farmer hearkens back to a previous era, when the farms in the district were owned by the manor, and protection of the estate was a prime responsibility of the lord (Christiansen 1996). Although the manor lord protects Poul and his family, he also takes quite a bit, represented symbolically in this tale by the preposterously large meal that he eats. The meal is so large, in fact, that it becomes memorialized in the landscape, lending its name to a local town (based on the false etymological equation: Dover = davre = breakfast). 

     The use of etiological tags, such as Dover, can anchor a story in the immediate locale. In narrative, etiological tags act as a form of external confirmation while, at the same time, attach the story to recognizable features of the landscape.

    The published version of the story differs little from the manuscript version.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man who lived in Illerup who was called Hjelmslev and he was a manor lord. He was renowned for being immensely strong. When he sat in a chair he was so strong that seven farmhands could tie a rope around him and still couldn't pull him out of the chair. He had a sword that had a name I can't remember, nor how big it was. He ruled the peasant farms in the area. Half way between Dover church and Illerup there were two solitary farms, and in one of them there was a man who had six sons, but they wouldn't do a thing and so they couldn't pay their debts. He forced them out of the house, and nobody came to live there afterward since it had been so damaged that nobody could live there, and so he put the land under another farmstead. The man who lived there was called Poul, but I can't remember the other one's name, I think it was Klaus. So now these seven vagabonds had nothing to eat, and since the manor lord was the reason they didn't have any bread, they swore that he'd experience misfortune, but first Poul would get what he had coming to him since it was him who'd gotten their property. They disappeared completely from the area, and people neither heard from them nor asked about them for quite a while until people thought they were dead and gone and they wouldn't see them again. Poul had been afraid, but now he felt safe again. Then late one winter evening, a potter came and wanted to stay at Poul's place and since he was a kind person, he said yes right away as usual. The man wanted to get his wagon under cover, but it wasn't possible because back then people didn't have as large houses as they do now, there wasn't any more shelter than for themselves. It wound up being parked just outside next to a pond of water. Just about bed time, the hired girl went out to get a bucket of water and she hears some people speaking inside the wagon. So she goes over and listens and it turns out to be one of Klaus's sons and Klaus himself who are lying there talking, wondering if the people weren't going to go to bed soon, it was ridiculous how long it was taking. She goes back inside and in the meantime they'd set up a bed for the other one, and he had already gone to bed. She tells Poul what she'd heard, and they agree to go out and tip the wagon with all the pots and everything else down into that water hole. Then they hurried around behind the end of the house and stand there listening, because it was really close to the house that waterhole. Then they see the other one come jumping out of the window, but there wasn't anything he could do, the other two had drowned. When he realized that, he ran away and left the horses and the wagon behind. A little while passed, but in the quiet week just before Maundy Thursday, a poor person came running as fast as he could to Poul and told him that he'd been sleeping in a barn out on Sjelle heath the previous night and he'd lain there and listened to how the other five had plotted that on Maundy Thursday morning, they'd kill him. Since Poul had been nice to him, he'd do him the favor of telling him. Poul didn't know what to do, he couldn't run away and desert his house and cattle, since then they'd just destroy everything. By the same token he couldn't let himself be destroyed, and in this way he ate up the day. When it started to get really light, he started to get uneasy. But just then the manor lord Hjelmslev came riding by on his way to church. Then Poul went out to him and told him how things stood concerning these five guys. Then he said, "Well, its possible that it's nothing other than a trick, but it could also be true. So if you'll treat me to a good meal, then I'll watch out for them, and if they come, I'll make up for it." You see, now they had other things to think about than these hooligans, now they had to serve up a meal for the manor lord who was a really big eater. There made huge preparations. Eggs and a shoulder of pork, that was the only pork they had in the house, but he ate it. As they were sitting there, right in the middle of the meal, the Dover church bell rang the last time, and as soon as it was done, the robbers began pounding on the door. Then the manor lord says, "It's annoying how eager they are, can't you tell them to wait until I'm done?" Poul also talked to them but they didn't pay too much attention. "Well, sit down for a little while by the door, for God's sake, I want to finish." Now they pounded again, but it was a little door and they couldn't really get at it, and he said that if they'd wait just a second, he'd open the door voluntarily. So, satisfied, they gave him a little while. Eventually, he finished and then he got up from the table and took his saber and then said to Poul that he could open the door now, but they better not come more than one at a time. Poul did that too and they came only one at a time, and then the manor lord stood inside and chopped their heads off and kicked their bodies aside. They didn't suspect a thing, even though they thought that it took a while, but they didn't manage to warn each other before the last one was kaput. Then the manor lord said, "Now I've made up for the meal." From that time on, the church has been called Dover church, and the place has been called Hjelmslev. The place. It was a small clearing and there's a cotter's place now which is called Hjelmslev house.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der boede en herremand i Illerup, der hed Hjelmslev, og det var et menneske, der var bekjendt for at v&#xE6;re s&#xE5; voldsom st&#xE6;rk. N&#xE5;r han sad i en stol og syv af de st&#xE6;rkeste karle slog et reb om l&#xE6;nden af ham, kunde de ikke tr&#xE6;kke ham af stolen. Han havde et sv&#xE6;rd, der havde et navn, som a ikke kan mindes, og m&#xE5;let p&#xE5; det heller ikke. Den herremand r&#xE5;dte for b&#xF8;ndergodset der omkring. Midt vejs mellem Dover kirke og Illerup var to enstedg&#xE5;rde, og i den ene var en mand, der havde 6 s&#xF6;nner, men de vilde ingen ting bestille, og s&#xE5; kunde de ikke svare deres skyld. Herremanden jog dem da ud af huset, og der kom ingen igjen, for det var blevet s&#xE5; ramponeret, at ingen kunde bo i det, men jorden lagde han under et andet sted. Den mand hed Povl, men ham, der blev jaget v&#xE6;k, han hed Klavs. Nu havde deher 7 drabanter jo ikke noget at ern&#xE6;re dem ved, og da herren var skyld i, at de var bleven br&#xF8;dl&#xF8;se, svor de ham en ulykke, men f&#xF8;rst skulde Povl have, for det var ham, der havde f&#xE5;et deres ejendom. De forsvandt nu helt fra egnen, og folk hverken h&#xF8;rte eller spurgte dem i l&#xE6;ngere tid. S&#xE5; troede man, de var b&#xE5;de d&#xF8;d og v&#xE6;k. Povl havde v&#xE6;ret r&#xE6;d en tid, men nu blev han tryg igjen. S&#xE5; en sildig aftenstund hen p&#xE5; vinteren kom der en pottekj&#xF8;rer og vilde logere ind ved Povl, og da han var et godsindet menneske, sagde han straks ja som s&#xE6;dvanlig. Vognen vilde manden haft i husly, men det kunde nu ikke lade sig gj&#xF8;re, for i den tid var folk ikke s&#xE5; bemidlede med hus som nu om tider. Vognen kom da til at st&#xE5; udenfor lige ved siden af en vanddam. Hen ved sengedags gik pigen ud at hente en spand vand, og da h&#xF8;rer hun nogen, der snakker i vognen. S&#xE5; g&#xE5;r hun hen og st&#xE5;r og lytter, og da er det en af Klavses s&#xF6;nner og Klavs selv, der ligger og snakker, om folkene ikke snart kunde v&#xE6;re g&#xE5;ede til sengs, det var voldsomt, s&#xE5; lang tid det tog. Imeldergodlag hun havde v&#xE6;ret ude, havde de f&#xE5;et en seng stilt an til den anden, og han var g&#xE5;et til sengs. S&#xE5; fort&#xE6;ller hun Povl, hvad hun havde h&#xF8;rt, og de kommer til ens om i al stilhed at g&#xE5; ud og v&#xE6;lte vognen med potter og samt ned i det vandhul. Dern&#xE6;st skubber de dem om ved enden af huset og st&#xE5;r og lytter, for hullet var t&#xE6;t derved. Da seer de, den anden kommer springende ud af vinduet, men nu var der ikke noget for dem at gj&#xF8;re, de andre to var druknede, og da han m&#xE6;rker det, str&#xF8;g han af og lod b&#xE6;ster og vogn i stikken. S&#xE5; gik der en lille tid, men s&#xE5; i den stille uge lige op til skj&#xE6;rtorsdag kom der en stakkel strygende hen til Povl, alt hvad remmer og t&#xF6;j kunde holde, og fortalte, at han havde logeret i en lade p&#xE5; Sjelle hede om natten og der ligget og h&#xF8;rt, hvordan 5 personer havde lagt r&#xE5;d op om at bes&#xF8;ge ham skj&#xE6;rtorsdag morgen, og s&#xE5; skulde kan f&#xE6;ldes. Men for det Povl havde v&#xE6;ret god imod ham, vilde han gj&#xF8;re ham den tjeneste at komme over at sige ham det. Povl vidste ikke, hvad han skulde gj&#xF8;re. Han kunde ikke rende fra det hele og lade hus og kv&#xE6;g i stikken, for s&#xE5; lagde de det jo helt &#xF8;de. Nej, s&#xE5; kunde han da for den sags skyld selv blive &#xF8;de ogs&#xE5;, alts&#xE5; bej han dagen op. Men den gang det blev rigtig lyst, begyndte han lige godt at blive bet&#xE6;nkelig. S&#xE5; kom herremanden Hjelmslev ridende forbi og vilde til kirke. Povl gik ud til ham og fortalte ham, hvordan sagerne de stod ang&#xE5;endes deher fem. "Ja, det kan jo godt v&#xE6;re, at det ikke er til andet end til at narre os med, men det kan og godt v&#xE6;re sandt. Men dersommentid du vil give en god davre, s&#xE5; vil a opholde mig efter dem, og kommer de, skal a nok gj&#xF8;re ligen for dem." Se, nu skulde de jo rette an for herremanden, der var s&#xE5; meget en gr&#xE5;dig &#xE6;der, og de fik travlt med at gj&#xF8;re store anstalter. En fl&#xE6;skebov var alt hvad fl&#xE6;sk de havde i huset, og s&#xE5; fik han &#xE6;g dertil, og han &#xE5;d det altsammen. Allerbedst som de sad, midt i m&#xE5;ltidet, s&#xE5; ringede Dover klokke sidste gang, og det f&#xF8;rste den var f&#xE6;rdig, s&#xE5; begyndte r&#xF6;verne at dundre p&#xE5; d&#xF6;ren. S&#xE5; siger herremanden: "Det er sv&#xE6;rt, s&#xE5; j&#xF6;ver de er, sig til dem, te jeg er ikke rigtig f&#xE6;rdig." Povl talte ogs&#xE5; til dem, men det agtede de kun lidt om. "Ja, s&#xE6;t nu lidt for d&#xF6;ren, for jeg vil miss&#xE6;l v&#xE6;re f&#xE6;rdig." Nu bumrede de jo p&#xE5;, men det var en lilleagtig d&#xF6;r, og de kunde ikke ret komme til, og han sagde, at dersom de nu vilde t&#xF8;ve lidt, s&#xE5; skulde han frivillig lukke op. De gav dem da ogs&#xE5; tilfreds den stund. Omsiger var han f&#xE6;rdig og rejste sig op fra bordet, tog sin sabel og sagde til Povl, at nu m&#xE5;tte han lukke op, men der m&#xE5;tte ikke svar velkomme uden &#xE9;n ad gangen. Povl gjorde det s&#xE5;dan, at der heller ikke kom uden &#xE9;n, og s&#xE5; stod herremanden inden for og hug hovedet af dem, som de kom, og sparkede kroppen til side. De fik ingen mistanke, omendskj&#xF6;ndt de nok tykte, det bundtede noget med det, men de kunde heller ikke komme af sted med at advare hinanden, n&#xE5;r de forst var kommen indenfor, for s&#xE5; var de kaput med det samme. Da den sidste vor sl&#xE5;et ihjel, sagde herremanden: "Nu har jeg gjort ligen for min davre." Fra den tid af kaldes kirken Dover kirke, og stedet, hvor r&#xF6;verne dr&#xE6;btes, kaldtes Hjelmslev-jorden. Det var en holdt, og der er nu et hus, som kaldes Hjelmslev-huset.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a manor lord who lived in Illerup who was called Hjelmslev, and he was a man who was renowned for being immensely strong. If he sat in a chair and seven farmhands bound a rope around him, they couldn't pull him from the chair. He had a sword which had a name I can't remember, nor its length. This manor lord ruled the peasant farms in that area. Halfway between Dover church and Illerup there were two single farms [enstedg&#xE5;rde], and in one of them there was a man who had six sons, but they wouldn&#x2019;t do a thing and then they couldn&#x2019;t pay their debt and the manor lord forced them out of the house, and nobody came to live there afterward since it had been so damaged that nobody could live there, and so he put the land under another farmstead. The man who got the land was named Poul, and the one who got chased away was named Klaus. Now these seven vagabonds had nothing to eat, and since the manor lord was the reason they didn&#x2019;t have any bread, they swore that he&#x2019;d experience misfortune, but first Poul would get what he had coming to him since it was he who&#x2019;d gotten their property. They disappeared completely from the area, and people neither heard from them nor asked about them for quite a while. So then people thought they were dead and gone. Poul had been afraid for a while, but now he felt safe again. Then late one winter evening, a potter came and wanted to stay at Poul&#x2019;s place and since he was a kind person, he said yes as usual. The man wanted to get his wagon under cover, but it wasn&#x2019;t possible because back then people didn&#x2019;t have as large houses as they do now. The wagon wound up being parked just outside next to a pond. Just about bedtime, the hired girl went out to get a bucket of water and then she hears some people speaking inside the wagon. So she goes over and listens and it turns out to be one of Klaus&#x2019;s sons and Klaus himself who are lying there talking, wondering if the people weren&#x2019;t going to go to bed soon, it was ridiculous how long it was taking. While she&#x2019;d been out, they&#x2019;d set up a bed for the other one [the potter], and he had already gone to bed. Then she tells Poul what she&#x2019;d heard, and they go quietly outside together and tip the wagon with all the pots and everything else down into that water hole. Then they go and wait behind the end of the house and stand there listening, because the water hole was close by. Then they see the other one come jumping out of the window, but there wasn&#x2019;t anything for him to do, since the other two had drowned and when he realizes that, he runs away and leaves the horses and the wagon there. Then a little while passed, but in the quiet week just before Maundy Thursday, a poor person came running as fast as he could to Poul and told him that he&#x2019;d been sleeping in a barn out on Sjelle heath the previous night and he&#x2019;d lain there and listened to how five people had discussed visiting him [Poul] Maundy Thursday morning, and then they&#x2019;d kill him. But because Poul had been nice to him, he&#x2019;d do him the favor of coming over and telling him about it. Poul didn&#x2019;t know what to do. He couldn&#x2019;t run away from it all and desert his house and cattle, because then they&#x2019;d just destroy everything. By the same token he could be destroyed himself if he just ate up the day. When it started to get really light, he started to get uneasy. Then the manor lord, Hjelmslev, came riding by on his way to church. Poul went out to him and told him how things stood concerning these five guys. &#x201C;Well, it's possible that it's nothing other than a way to trick us, but it might also be true. So if you&#x2019;ll treat me to a good meal, then I&#x2019;ll watch out for them, and if they come, I&#x2019;ll make up for it.&#x201D; You see, now they had to serve up a meal for the manor lord who was a really big eater, and they got busy with all the preparations. The only pork they had was a shoulder of pork, and he got eggs as well and he ate it all. Just as they were sitting there, right in the middle of the meal, the Dover church bell rang the last time, and as soon as it was done, the robbers began pounding on the door. Then the manor lord says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s annoying how eager they are, can&#x2019;t you tell them I&#x2019;m not done yet?&#x201D; Poul also talked to them but they didn&#x2019;t pay too much attention to him. &#x201C;Well, sit down for a little while by the door, for God&#x2019;s sake, I want to finish.&#x201D; Now they pounded again, but it was a little door and they couldn&#x2019;t really get at it, and he said that if they&#x2019;d wait just a second, he&#x2019;d open the door voluntarily. So, satisfied, they gave them a moment. Hjelmslev finished soon and then he got up from the table and took his saber and then said to Poul that he could open the door now, but they&#x2019;d better not come more than one at a time. Poul did just so, so that they only came through one at a time, and then the manor lord stood inside and chopped their heads off as they came in and kicked their bodies aside. They didn&#x2019;t suspect a thing, even though they thought that it took a while, but they didn&#x2019;t manage to warn each other when they first had gotten inside, because then it was immediately kaput. When the last one had been killed, the manor lord said, &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;ve made up for the meal.&#x201D; From that time on, the church has been called Dover church, and the place where the robbers were killed has been called the Hjelmslev ground. It was a smallholding and now it&#x2019;s a house which is called the Hjelmslev house.</english_publication>

    <annotation>This story provides a close reading of the organization of two local farms. Outlying farms date back to the partitioning of the lands from the end of the eighteenth century. Once fields had been consolidated, farmhouses were physically moved from the village center out onto the new fields. The timbers would be saved from the original farm, and placed on a new foundation sometimes made with stones from the original farm. The new farm building would then be given new stucco walls as most farms at the time were half-timber construction. The result of this physical removal of buildings from the villages onto the fields was the wide dispersal of farms across the landscape. Farms that had once nestled up to each other cheek-by-jowl in earlier villages could end up quite a distance from each other. Peder also draws attention to the difference in the quality of the land attached to these newly created farms, and it is this disparity in distribution that informs this story. 

     The financial difficulties of the farmer at Hell resonate with those confronting the farmer Klaus in the previous story (PJ 1.01). But where Klaus in that story had brought calamity on himself--and therefore deserved to be punished--the farmer at Hell was the victim of the capriciousness of the partitioning system and the forces of the newly emerging free market system.

     The story balances precariously on the border between tall tale and legend. This type of generic fence sitting is a characteristic of Peder's storytelling. The hiring of the farmhand on the way to market is a narrative cue that aligns the story with the folk tale. Although the commerce laws forbade making deals on the way to or from market towns, the negotiation here for the services of a hired hand possibly fell outside the parameters of that law (Tangherlini 2012). 

     The agreement that the farmhand would take over the farm once the farmer was too old to continue was a standard agreement, usually between a  farmer or cotter and his children: a child would take over the farm in exchange for continued lodging and a specified amount of foodstuffs for the parent once the parent had gotten too old to continue farming. This system was known as aft&#xE6;gt. The unusual aspect to the agreement made in this story is that it is made outside of the family with a virtual stranger. The farmhand's later actions suggest that even this agreement may be part of his larger confidence game. As such, the farmhand's actions align well with those of untrustworthy wanderers. 

     The farmhand's solution to the problems at Hell are at first clever, and later downright criminal. The first con that the farmhand undertakes is an elaborate switch at the mill. The switch is rather complicated, and relies on an understanding of local milling practice. The farmhand can only get this information by befriending and ultimately bribing the journeyman miller. Peder's own work as a journeyman miller doubtlessly informs this part of the story. The implication is, of course, that the miller is not beyond reproach. In the story, Peder endorses the actions of the farmhand, since he succeeds (with the help of the miller), to cheat another farmer out of his grain. Endorsing a strategy that puts personal gain first, rather than communal protection, is unusual. 

     The second part of the story focuses on the poor relationship between the two preposterously named farms. The farmhand's actions are extreme in every thing he does: his theft from the mill, his deceit of the neighbors, his murder of the old woman, his multiple thefts from the farm at "Heaven," his subsequent cons concerning the conjuring of the woman's spirit, and his multiple manipulations to get people to pay compensation to him for her death. Indeed, his actions align him more with a particularly malicious household spirit or perhaps with the devil than an ambitious or entrepreneurial farmhand. This identification of the farmhand as the devil might help explain the names of the two farms.

     The appearance of a peddler in the final episode of the story aligns well with other stories Peder tells in which these wanderers figure prominently. The final conjuring is clearly unsuccessful since the ghost of the murdered woman continues to haunt.

     The story is reminiscent of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "Lille Claus og store Claus" (1835). The story was widely known throughout Scandinavia, and is classified as ATU 1535, "The Rich and the Poor Farmer." 

     The reference to "specier" as the unit of money points to a time prior to the monetary reform of 1873 (Hvidt 1990, 250-252). For a discussion of the monetary systems in Denmark during the nineteenth century, see the annotation for BJK 3.40.

     Peder only told two stories in his first session with Tang Kristensen, although they were both quite long. According to Minder og Oplevelser, this first session was split over two evenings in the mill, and so it is likely that each of these stories was told on subsequent nights. 

      This story is cataloged in the fair copy collection of fairy tales as &#xC6;v 1295 and can be compared with a story in the first published volume of &#xC6;ventyr fra Jylland (JFm V 49).</annotation>

kl&#xE6;des paa med Kl&#xE6;der og Kaabe, ligesom
hun ellers blev kl&#xE6;dt paa i levende Live
n&#xE6;renstid det var koldt og s. er der kun

s. h. men a skulde helst vide hvor stor
Foden var. Ja det kan du gaa ud og snak
ke med hende om, men du kommer til at
snakke lidt h&#xF8;jt, for hun er lidt tung-
h&#xF8;rende. Skom. gik ud til hende og siger
om hu vil ikke fly ham Foden han kan
se hvor stor den er. Men hu svarte ikke
S. bliver h. hidsig, s. l&#xE6;nge staar h. og
pr&#xE6;ker med hende og vipper hende over i 
noget Skramleri ha havde bag i Vog, for
hun var jo lidt stiv, da h. griber i Foden
Nej holdt s. h. det gj&#xF8;r Ka, a vil nok
have St&#xF8;vler til hende, men have Hovedet
slaaet i Stykk. af hende det bryder a mig
ikke om. Ak den lebendige Kj&#xE6;ll. hun
kan vel taale et Skrup. s. Skom. h rev

3760B
lidt paa det tyste men det viste sig hu
kunde ikke, for hu var slaaet Stend&#xF8;d.
Ja holdt nu god Karl, nu skal du i Retten.
Aa nej det [gj&#xF8;r] maa du ikke gj&#xF8;re, husk
paa, a har baade Kone og B&#xF8;rn, kan vi ikke

samme og det blev saadan at Skom. skulde
give 25 Sp. og s. skulde Karlen kj&#xF8;re. S. 
kj&#xF8;rte h. ogsaa ud af Byen. Nu maa a
vel egentlig helst se at kom hjem, for
hvem kan vide, om det ikke kunde blive op
lyst. S. tog Karlen Vejen om ad H&#xF8;ve
og efter Vissing og i de Dage var der Kroer
som den er endnu, men den Kromand var
bekjendt for at v&#xE6;re saadan et knurendis
hidsigt Mske. Ham kj&#xF8;rte Ka. til og s.
gik h. ind til ham og s. H&#xF8;r kan a ikke
faa dig til at gaa ud og give min Moder et
godt glas Drikkels, det kan hun tr&#xE6;nge til
og det fr&#xF8;s klingrendes haardt den Dag. Ja
har du noget at betale med s. M. s. kan
det nok lade sig gj&#xF8;re. Ja v&#xE6;rsgo her er
Penge. Da Kr. havde faaet Pengene skynder
h. sig. Hun er lidt tungh&#xF8;rig, s. du kom
mer til at r&#xF8;vsle lidt med hende inden
[h] kan hu ikke forstaa hvad det er. H. gik
ud til Vog og sn. til hende, men alt det

3761A
h. raabte det hjalp ikke. Var ikke vant
til at f&#xE6;rdes med Lumpe. Uden videre
giver h. hende Krus og Indhold lige ind
i Hovedet. Det Slag det v&#xE6;ltede hun for.
N. s. h. det gj&#xF8;r Ka. n&#xE5; gj&#xE6;sterne de bliver
behandlede paa den Maade her. Ja s. Kr. saa-
dant L&#xE6;der, saadant Sm&#xF8;relse. Det er hverken
hun eller mig godt tjent med, her ligger hun
nu og h. begynder [at] at fl&#xE6;tte til Side ved
Ansigtet af hende, og det viste sig at h.
havde ramt hende med Kruset lige midt
i Panden, der var bleven et stort blaat
Sted. Da Krm. fik det at se, s. blev h.
lidt lavm&#xE6;let. S. s. h. det havde a lige godt
ikke troet, te a havde slaaet s. haardt til
for det ser jo ud som hu er d&#xF8;d. Ja, det er
hun, men [d] du vilde vel nok [gron] v&#xE6;re
s. god og sige mig hvor det n&#xE6;reste Tingsted
det er. Aa det er ligevalle da ikke v&#xE6;rd
at tage det s. haardt, vi maa hellere se
om vi ikke kan kom til ens i Mindelighed
Ja, det er knap a kan det s. Ka. for de
vil knaske ude af mig hvor a har gj&#xF8;rt
af min Moder, men er det saadan, det er
dig meget om at gi&#xF8;re, vil a lige godt tag
B&#xF8;de for hende, s. kommer a ud af Lagerne

3761B
som a kan bedst. Hvor stor den B&#xF8;de blev
var der ingen der fik at vide, for det var en
velhavende Mand, men den blev vel noget
stor, og s. kj&#xF8;rte h. v&#xE6;k. Kj&#xF8;rte paa J&#xE6;vngyde
og [alle] over ved Byens M&#xF8;llevad og op til
Nygaard Skov og op gjennem H&#xF8;ve Hule. Se da
h. kommer til Munden af H. H. da var det
blivet Aften og Maanen skinte s. dejlig, da laa
der en Kr&#xE6;m og sover og hans S&#xE6;k laa ved Si

t&#xE6;nker h. ved sig selv: Der kan maaske gj&#xF8;

alt Kr&#xE6;mmet af i Vog. og tager Kj. og stop
per h nede i Posen i Stedet med Hovedet op

indtil h. er kommen oven ud af Skoven og
s. kj&#xF8;rte h. til det sang i Toldene derfra
og s. hjem. Kj&#xF8;rte op og leveret B&#xE6;sterne

Du har nok sovet vel l&#xE6;nge Kr&#xE6;sten, men

og der blev en Forf&#xE6;rdelse over det hele

3762B
samlingen. Vi er bliven forb&#xF8;jen s. M. 
at &#xF8;nske hende hertil og saadan en Land-
stryger skal s. kom og f&#xF8;re os i det Uf&#xF8;re.
Det kommer til Skj&#xE6;ldmaal imellem ham
og kr&#xE6;mmeren og omsider fik Kr. flest
at vide, hvordan det var gaaet til og s.
str&#xF8;g h. derfra det villeste h. havde l&#xE6;rt, h.
vilde ikke have med deres V&#xE6;rk at skaffe.
En 2 Dags Morg. stillede M. nede ved Kar
len og fortalte ham, hvordan det hele var
gaaet til, og bad ham nok s. mindelig om
h. vilde ikke s&#xE6;tte hende hen igien, heller
vidste h. ingen Raad. Jo s. h. K. nu skal
a s. gj&#xF8;re det en Gang til, og s. skal hu
nok blive henne, men den g. vil a have
12 Spes. for det og s. skal du sv&#xF8;be hende
i et Jordlage, hu skal ingen andre Ting
v&#xE6;re i. S. tog han en Skubkarre og kj&#xF8;rt
derop og der satte h. hende paa den og s.
kj&#xF8;rte h. hende ned i Siem D&#xF8;jer og man
te hende der. Men siden den Dag har det 
ogsaa sp&#xF8;get der.
</danish_manuscript>
    <english_manuscript>West of Svejstrup is Siem and on the eastern edge of Siem there's a farm that's called Brandstrup farm and as long as people can remember, it's been an outlying farm and it's been built up. North of it, about half way between Brandstrup and Hvidsminde there was another farm and the farm was well off since the earth there was so much better and at the other place, there was poverty and nothing else. Because of that, the places were called Hell and Heaven. One evening, around November, the farmer in Hell sat and talked to his wife and said they couldn't pay what they owed and they'd be forced to give up the farm unless they figured something out. She told him that he should find a good strong farmhand and work the land a little, then they should be able to get food from such a field and he thought the advice was sound and he went to Ry market, since in those days there was a general market there. When he gets down here to Glentholm, they called it Ry Mill in those days, he catches up with a big farmhand, and they start talking together and it turned out that they were headed to find the same thing and they reach an agreement about half the way there and they went back home. The farmhand was to get what the farmer could afford in payment, and when the farmer later gave up, he was to get the property. They come home to the wife and the farmer tells her: Here's the farmhand. He's a little bit big, but we'll probably get food. Then the farmhand says, well it looks pretty meager here, but it can probably be made better. Do you have anything to drive with? Yes, we do, said the farmer, we have a pair of oxen, and a wagon. Do you have any empty sacks. Yes, we have so many that we can easily drive to the mill for the sacks' sake, but we have to stay away, since we don't have any grain. Well, just give me the sacks, said the farmhand, and he got them and then he drove out into a pit and filled them with sand, two measures in some and four in others, depending on whether it was to be for flour or meal or bread. Drives off to the mill. It isn't like now, you unhitched the horses and carried your sacks in and then you had to watch out, when the one in front of you had finished milling, you were to step up, otherwise you wouldn't get your grain milled that day. That's how it went then. The farmhand goes and complains, says he's taking too long and they're milling the grain of the one who'd come after him. Goes over to the master journeyman and complains to him, if he couldn't give him advice for this. Well, said the master journeyman, I don't have any advice for that, you'll have to wait to tomorrow or very late tonight until we're finished. Yes, but I absolutely have to get home, and he slips the journeyman a mark. Sure, well now I'll tell you, keep an eye out, when someone comes and is to have a sack taken away, you should come up first and take it away and put your own sack in its place, each person was supposed to take their own sacks away. He was so good at it, that he got some good grain and then he drives home. Then they got some baked bread since they baked so many loaves up in Heaven, they'd get a new loaf from them, otherwise they weren't in such bad shape. They had an old woman up there in that farm and she was so incredibly nosy and asked about the new farmhand they'd gotten and the wife was quite tired of that and complained about it when she got home. Yes, said the farmhand, wait just a little while, then she'll have more to think about. Now, you can go up and borrow their measure. So she did that and brought it home the next day. The old woman grabbed hold of the measure and inspected it and there was a L&#xFC;beck coin stuck in between the ribs down in the bottom and he'd put it there on purpose. No, lookie here, said the old woman, now I can certainly say what they've used this measure for, they've been measuring money with it. She gets so curious about this that she gets her husband to go down there and get permission to store a chest in there and she wants to be in it herself. He goes down there and greets them. Good evening. The farmhand isn't home. Listen, I have a storage chest I want to keep down here. There's linen in it and we're going to have guests. I don't want to put it out in the barn. The bugs could spoil the linen. And it wouldn't be so good to have it out in the moist air. Sure, both he and his house were at his service. The next morning. The chest is driven down there, unloaded and placed next to the wood-burning stove. Around noon, the farmhand comes back from the woods and sees the chest. Hunh, what's this? They tell him. There's something else in there. You aren't going to break the chest open. It wouldn't matter, we can always close it up well again. Breaks it open and the old witch is sitting there and she throws a couple of playing pieces at them and they were quite big. That's quite a game, now I'll see if I can't satisfy her curiosity. He takes his hatchet and hits her in the forehead with it. She couldn't handle that and she dies. Well, well, you're quite a young man, doing that to an old person. What are we going to do now, when they find out. Well, it will never be discovered, now you'll see and he took one of the biggest sausages and puts it in her mouth, it couldn't budge either forward or backward, and then they let her be. The man from Heaven drove down and picked her up at the end of the day, and he hadn't gotten too far from the place when he began to talk to her. But she wouldn't answer. Then he thought, well I'll see if I can't liven her up. Drove down one rock pile and over another. But nothing helped, she didn't say a peep. Well, how is my mother, said his wife when he came to the farm. Well, you can ask her yourself, since I can't get a word out of her. Pretty darn sick of it. Oh, you are are you? Well let's get her down, because she might be sick of lying in that chest herself, and they unloaded her and brought her in and opened it up. Well there you have it. I often warned her, that old bag, that she should watch her mouth, and now its gone and done her in. They took her and lay her on straw and began thinking about her funeral, there was nothing else they could do. They hitched up the horses and drove to the mill. As soon as they got home, they began to brew so they could have some yeast for the bread. At night they sit down there in Hell making spoons, since they had to make use of all their time. Then he said, they've made some good beer up in Heaven today. Yes, they have, says the husband, who'd had a taste of it. Well, we can get it, said the farmhand, and those two guys talk about it for a while and they decide to go get the beer. The farmhand hitched up the oxen and they put an empty barrel in the wagon and rumble up nearby and while the husband held the oxen, the farmhand carried the beer out to the barrel, until there was only a little puddle left in the bottom, he left that there, and he put the tub up on its side and the man drives home. The farmhand goes in and takes the old woman who is lying on straw and puts her head first into the little bit that was left. The next morning, the first thing the husband does when he wakes up is to call to his wife and say, hey, listen, could you go out and get me a taste of the new beer, I'm so incredibly thirsty, he had a real sweet tooth (l&#xE6;kkermund). She goes out there, too, and she finds the tub, and there was something cold lying in there, but she didn't know what it was. They both went out there with a candle and they could see what it was. Well, well, you've drunk well, she's drunk all of the beer, but we better bake, since we've gotten everything ready for that. Yes, we'd better, and then they bake that day, and get the bread out of the oven and they put the loaves on their end in the baking trough as is the custom. Then they went to bed up there, but the one's down in Hell don't. They went and got the bread and went on home with it and then they lay the old one along the trough, but first they took a crust and chewed it a bit, so it'd be more likely they'd think that it was her who'd eaten the bread and then the next morning, the husband said, when he saw how things stood, we aren't going to brew today because on top of a meal like that, she'll probably need something to drink. But tomorrow, we can slaughter the ox, since we can see if she can go out tonight and eat a living ox. If she can do that, then we'll have to do something else. Around evening time, the husband there goes down to Hell and gets permission to have the farmhand come and hold the ox the following morning, and they agree that he is to come up there at six in the morning, it was right about Christmastime, and so that was early. It almost sounded like they were afraid of the ox, they could have easily spared themselves the trouble that they were going to have with him. Oh no, said the husband, it will never work. Remember that this is the third time, and he was a little superstitious. Yes, well you know that all good things happen in threes, said the farmhand, and then there was nothing else to say, and they went up together to the ox, got it happily out of the barn and got it home and slaughtered it immediately. Then there was nothing more to it. The farmhand took the tail, cut it off and went up to Heaven with it, and then he went in and got the woman and put her in the ox's stall, but he put her legs in the ties and he put her head out toward the gutter and then he stuffed the tail into her mouth and then he went home. The next morning at six o'clock as agreed, he was up at the farm again. Then he calls to the husband who hadn't gotten up yet. OK, OK, said the husband, come inside, we can have us a bite of bread. He goes in too. Don't be shy, says the husband, take as much as you'd like since you're going to need all your strength, and the farmhand didn't need to be told twice, he took a lot of food. When they were done, they went out into the barn and had the lamp with them. Yes, it's standing alone in its stall, it's easy to recognize, it's right here by the door. Well, I can't see any ox, says the farmhand. And if it's an ox, then it's certainly one of the small ones. Watch out, says the husband, let me come with the lamp, you can't see anything, and when he comes and sees, he almost dropped the lamp out of fear, because there lay the woman and she'd done away with the ox, except for a little piece of tail, she couldn't finish that. Goddammit! since you've seen this much, I can tell you the whole story, and then he told him how things had gone from the beginning to the end. Can you give me some advice, he says to the farmhand, how can we get rid of her? Well, I know one thing, said the farmhand, but it is a little expensive and it's that she needs to be conjured, there's nothing else to do with her. Well, who can do that. I can give you the name of one who can, and it is no other than myself, I can do it, and I will gladly do it too, but I need to be paid well for it, because if it goes bad, it will be me who suffers. But if you give me 25 spesier, then I'll do it. Well, that's a lot of money, said the husband, but if she won't come again, I'll agree to that. OK, says the farmhand, I'll make no other conditions than you let me go home and get our wagon, since you probably don't want to lend me your wagon. We don't have anything other than oxen, and it really should be horses. Sure, I'll gladly lend you mine, said the husband. OK, well then, she needs to be washed clean over her whole body, and she is to be put in clean linen, and then she should be dressed in her church clothes, and then she is to be dressed in regular clothing with a cape, just like she'd be dressed when she was alive when it was cold outside, and that's all there is left to do. You can't mention her here at the farm for the first three months, because then I can't say what might happen, it might happen that you'd wish her back. Well, as long as there's nothing other than that, we can certainly observe those rules, and go along with all of that. Then the farmhand got her in all her finery and then he drove off with her. Now, frost had set in and the farmhand thought she'd probably keep for a little while and he drives to Aarhus with her, and as soon as he gets there, he drives up to a cobbler's door and he stops there. Then he goes in and says, Listen here, cobbler, I have an old woman sitting out here in a wagon, do you think you might have a pair of boots for her, she can't continue with the ones she has. I probably do, he says, but I probably better know how big her feet are. Well, he could go out and talk to her about that, but you'll have to speak loudly, because she's a little hard of hearing. The cobbler goes out and asks if she couldn't give him her foot, so he can see how big it is. But she didn't answer. Then he gets angry, he's stood there so long, preaching to her and he knocks her over back into some junk he had there in the back of the wagon, because she was a little stiff, when he grabs hold of her foot. Hey, stop, the farmhand says, sure I want boots for her, but to have her head smashed in, I'm not really interested in that. Oh, that damn hag, she can probably take a little push, said the cobbler, he shook her a little, but it turned out she couldn't, because she'd been knocked stone dead. Wait a second, my good man, you're going to court. Oh, no, please don't do that, I have a wife and children, can't we come to an agreement? Then they talked to each other and they agreed that the cobbler would give him 25 specier and then the farmhand would drive off. Then he drove out of the town. Now I'd better see about coming home, since who knows if someone might figure this out. Then the farmhand took the road past H&#xF8;ve and past Vissing, and in those days there was an inn as there is now, but the innkeeper then was known for being a really short tempered guy. The farmhand drove over to him and then he went in and said, Listen, can't I get you to go out and give my mother a good glass of something to drink, she probably needs it and it was freezing cold that day. Sure, do you have anything to pay with, asked the man, then I certainly can do it. Yes, here you are, here's some money. When the innkeeper had gotten the money, he hurries. She's a little hard of hearing, so you're going to have to shake her a bit to get her to understand what's going on. He went out to the wagon and spoke to her, but it didn't matter how much he shouted. Wasn't used to dealing with the infirm. Without further ado, he throws the mug and its contents at her head. The blow knocked her over. Oh, said the farmhand, so that's how guests are treated here. Yes, said the innkeeper, that kind of leather, that kind of grease. Neither she nor I is well served by that, now she's lying here and he begins to brush at the side of her face, and it turned out that the mug had hit her right in the middle of the forehead, there was a big black and blue mark there. When the innkeeper saw that, he dropped his voice. Then he said, he didn't think he'd hit her that hard since it looked like she was dead. Yes, she is, and so you'll be good enough to tell me where the closest court is. Oh come on, you needn't take it so hard, we should better see if we can't figure something out. We'll I can't really do that, since they'll get it out of me what I've done with my mother, but if it's so that you can do something, then I'll take a fine for her, and then I'll get out of it as best I can. No one found out how big that fine was, because he was a wealthy man, but it was certainly pretty big, and then he drove off. He drove up along J&#xE6;vngyde and over by the town's mill and up to Nygaard Woods and up through H&#xF8;ve Hollow. Then when he gets to the mouth of H&#xF8;ve Hollow, it was night and the moon was shining so beautifully, and there was a peddler lying there sleeping, and his bag lay beside him. When the farmhand sees this, he thinks to himself: I can do some business here and he takes the bag and pours all of the wares into the wagon and takes the old hag and stuffs her down into the bag instead, with her head up and then he drives carefully away, until he gets out of the woods and then he drove until the reins sang and drove home. Drove up and delivered the horses and thanked them for loaning them to him and asked them to remember what he'd asked them in regards to the woman. Then around seven thirty, he wakes up, the peddler does, and he says to himself, you've certainly slept late Kr&#xE6;sten, but you can probably still make it, you can get there by nightfall, he would always sleep at Heaven at night and that's where he was headed. Then he started to put his bag on and he says to himself: boy it seems like this bag has gotten so heavy, but I can certainly drag it up there. Then I'll get a rest and then I can start selling things right away and then the bag will get lighter. Then he wandered off. He was sweating, but finally he gets there and comes in just as they're sitting there eating dinner. Good evening and god bless. Thank you, he said, the husband does. It's Kristen. Yes, it certainly is me and no one else. It's been a while since you've been here. Yes, I'm coming straight from Hamburg. You don't walk that road in two days. Well, sit down here at the table and have a little dinner. Why thank you, he says and they ate and when they were more or less done, he says, it seems there's a person missing. Yes, there is, said the husband, and it was quiet for a little bit. Yes, our old mother, where is she. She's dead, he says, the husband does. Then they were done with dinner and the peddler had put his bag up on the table. Oh dear God, I'd love to see that soul one more time, she was a wonderful woman to talk to, and as he says that, he's untied his bag and the old woman sticks her head out. What's this, says the peddler. God help me that's the old woman, and the whole group was shocked. We've been forbidden to wish her here and then a hobo like this comes and brings us into this trouble. They start arguing, him and the peddler and after a while, the peddler learns most of it, how things had happened and then he got out of there as fast as he could, he didn't want to have anything to do with their problems. The next morning, the husband went down to the farmhand and told him what had happened, and asked nicely if he wouldn't please conjure her again, he didn't know what else to do. OK, said the farmhand, now I'll do it one more time, and she'll certainly stay away, but this time I want 12 specier and I want you to wrap her in a burial cloth, she's not to be in anything else. Then he took a wheelbarrow and drove up there and they put her on it and then he drove her down to Siem D&#xF8;jer and conjured her there. But since then, there's been haunting down there.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Vesten for Svejstrup ligger Siem By, og i den &#xF8;stre Kant af den ligger den Gaard, som kaldes Brandstrup Gaarden. Saa langt som Mands Minde gaar, har det v&#xE6;ret et Ensted-Sted og bebygget. Saadan omtrent midt vejs mellem Brandstrup og Hvidsminde laa der ogsaa en Gaard, og der var Velstand til huse, for der var Jorden saa meget bedre, men i Brandstrup-Gaarden var der Armod og ikke andet. Af den Grund n&#xE6;vntes Stederne Hellede og Himmerig. En Aften omkring ved Novembers Tide sad Manden i Hellede og Snakkede med hans Kone om, at de ikke kunde Svare, hvad de kunde, og at de blev n&#xF8;dt til at opgive det, dersom der ikke blev andet Raad. Saa gav hun ham det Raad, at han skulde se at faa sig en st&#xE6;rk Karl, og saa skulde de arbejde dygtig paa Jorden, saa maatte de nok kunne saa F&#xF8;den ud af saadan en Mark. Han befandt, at Raadet var godt, og gik saa til Ry Marked, hvor der var Folkemarked den Gang. Da han kommer ned til Glentholm, som den Gang kaldtes Ry M&#xF8;lle, saa kom han i F&#xF8;lge med en stor Karl, og de gik og snakkede med hinanden. Saa viste det sig, at de gik efter det samme, og kom ogsaa til Rette paa halvvejs. De gik da hjem igjen, og L&#xF8;nnen blev saadan, at Karlen skulde gaa for, hvad Manden kunde give, og siden, naar Manden faldt fra, skulde han have St&#xF8;tterne (hus og det hele). De kommer hjem til Konen, og Manden siger til hende: "Der er nu Karlen; ja, han er lidt storagtig, (velvogsen), men vi faar vel F&#xF8;den." "Ja, det ser jo smaat ud ved jer," siger Karlen, "men det kan vel bedres. Har I noget Kj&#xF8;ret&#xF8;j?" &#x2014; "Ja, vi har," siger Manden, "vi har et Par Stude og saa en Vogn." -"Har I nogle tomme S&#xE6;kke?" &#x2014; "Ja, vi har saa mange, te vi kan kj&#xF8;re til M&#xF8;lle til Ordentlighed for Posers Skyld. Men vi maa kj&#xF8;nt blive derfra, for det vi har ikke Korn." &#x2014; "Ja, da lad kuns mig faa Poserne," siger Karlen, og saa fik han dem, de havde. Saa kj&#xF8;rte han ud i en Sandgrav og fyldte dem med Sand, to Skj&#xE6;pper i somme og fire Skj&#xE6;pper i somme, eftersom de skulde v&#xE6;re til Mel eller Gryn eller Br&#xF8;d, og saa kj&#xF8;rer han til M&#xF8;lle.
Den Gang var det ikke saadan som nu; da spandt en fra, og hver Mand bar sine Poser ind. Naar han kom ind med dem, skulde han passe paa at holde sig til, og naar den var f&#xE6;rdig, der fik malet lige f&#xF8;r ham, saa skulde han have sit Korn slaaet paa, ellers fik han ikke malet den Dag. Saadan gik det nu til den Gang. Karlen gaar jo og vr&#xF8;vler saa l&#xE6;nge, te den n&#xE6;ste kommer ind, og de kommer til at male paa hans, der var bag efter. Saa gaar han hen til Mestersvenden og klager hans N&#xF8;d til ham, saadan og saadan var det gaaet, om han kunde ikke sige ham noget Raad til det. "Ja," siger Svenden, "det v&#xE9;d a ingen Raad for, du kommer til at vente til i Morgen, eller ogsaa maa du blive her saa langt ud paa Aftenen, til vi bliver f&#xE6;rdig."&#x2014; "Jammen a skulde absolut hjem," og saa putter han en Mark til Svenden. "Ja, nu skal a sige dig noget. Du kan passe paa, naar der kommer &#xE9;n og skal have sin S&#xE6;k taget fra, at du kan komme f&#xF8;rst og tage fra, og saa kan du s&#xE6;tte din egen S&#xE6;k i Stedet."
Naa, han var saa godt om sig, te han faar den ene S&#xE6;k efter den anden, ene godt Korn, og saa kj&#xF8;rer han jo hjem med hele L&#xE6;sset. Nu fik de bagt Br&#xF8;d, og da de forhen havde laant saa meget Br&#xF8;d oppe i Himmerig, skulde de jo have sendt et nyt Br&#xF8;d der op til at begynde med. Oppe i den Gaard havde de en gammel Kone, og hun var saa f&#xE6;lt nysgjerrig efter at h&#xF8;re ud om den nye Karl, de havde faaet.  Konen i Hellede gik selv derop med Br&#xF8;det, og hun var n&#xE6;rved at blive kjed af den gamles Snak og sagde det ogsaa, den Gang hun kom hjem. Saa siger Karlen: "Ja, t&#xF8;v kuns lidt, hun skal nok faa mere at t&#xE6;nke paa. Nu kan du gaa op og laane os deres Skj&#xE6;ppe." Saa gjorde hun det og bar den hjem Andendagen. Den gamle Kone skulde strags hen og have fat i Skj&#xE6;ppen for at se efter, og da var der en Lyb&#xE6;kker gaaet fast imellem Staverne nede i Bunden. "Nej se," siger hun den gamle, "nu kan a missel sige jer, hvad de har brugt skj&#xE6;ppen til, for de har maalt Penge med den." Men Karlen havde jo sat den fast der med Vilje. Den gamle blev saa nysgjerrig efter at faa at vide, hvordan det forhavde sig med de Penge, te hun omsider faar Manden til at gaa derned og faa Lov til at s&#xE6;tte en Kiste, og saa vilde hun selv v&#xE6;re i den. Han gaar altsaa derned og hilser Godaften. Karlen var ikke hjemme lige i Tiden. "H&#xF8;r," siger Manden, "a har en Standkiste, a vilde have sat herned, den er fuld af Linned. Vi stal have fremmede, og saa holder vi ikke af at s&#xE6;tte den ud i Laden, for Ut&#xF8;jet kunde jo gaa hen og spolere Linnedet; tillige med kan den heller ikke godt taale at staa ude i den Fugtighed." Jo, siger den fattige Mand, det kunde den godt, baade ham og hans Hus stod til deres Tjeneste. Anden Dags Formiddag blev saa Kisten kj&#xF8;rt derned og l&#xE6;sset af og sat ved siden af Kakkelovnen.
Saa om Middagen kommer Karlen fra Skovs og ser den Kiste. Nu havde han jo ikke h&#xF8;rt den omtale. "Hvad, hvordan er den kommen der?" siger han. Det fort&#xE6;ller de. "Ja, der er andet under det."&#x2014;"Ja vil du da vel ikke til at br&#xE6;kke Kisten."&#x2014;"Det gj&#xF8;r ingen Ting," siger han, "vi kan lukke den lige saa godt igjen." Han lukker op, og der sidder denher gamle Hegs og slaar et Par Brikker paa dem saa meget gevaltig store. "Ja var det dog et sv&#xE6;rt spil, da skal a se, om a kan ikke faa hendes Nysgjerrighed tilfredsstillet." Han tager saa hans Bind&#xF8;gse og slaar hende for Panden med. Det kunde hun lige godt ikke taale og sov hen med det samme. "Jaja," siger Konen, "du er mins&#xE6;l en Karl til at gj&#xF8;re det af med gamle Folk. Men hvad skal vi nu gj&#xF8;re, naar det bliver opdaget?"&#x2014;"Jammen det bliver aldrig opdaget," siger han, "for nu skal I se." Saa tager han en af de st&#xF8;rste P&#xF8;lser og putter i Munden af hende, saa den hverken kan komme frem eller tilbage. Derefter lukte han Kisten ganske forsigtig til igjen og lod hende staa.
Manden paa Himmerig kj&#xF8;rte jo ned og hentede hende, da Dagen var omme, og han kunde ikke vel komme fra Stedet, inden han begyndte at snakke til hende, men hun svarte jo ikke. Saa t&#xE6;nkte han: "Da skal a se, om a kan ikke faa Liv i hende," og han kj&#xF8;rte af &#xE9;n Stendynge og paa en anden. Men lige meget hjalp det, ikke saa meget som et Kvab hun sagde. "Naa, hvordan har min Moder det?" siger Konen, da han kom ind i Gaarden. "Ja, nu kan du jo selv sp&#xF8;rge hende om det, for a er missel kyv opaa 'et."&#x2014;"Naa, det er du, ja lad os saa faa hende af, for hun kan ogsaa v&#xE6;re kyv opaa at ligge i den Kiste." De faar hende jo l&#xE6;sset af og faar Kisten ind og faar den lukket op. "Ja, der har vi det," siger Konen, "a har tit og mange Gange advaret hende, det gamle Skind, for hun har aldrig rigtig forstaaet at passe Maaden, og nu er det ligevel gaaet hen og gaaet hende over." De tog saa og lagde hende paa Straa og begyndte nu at spekulere paa at danne til Begravelse, der var jo ikke andet at se efter. De fik sp&#xE6;ndt for og kj&#xF8;rte til M&#xF8;lle, og det f&#xF8;rste de kom hjem, gav de dem til at brygge for at have nogle Gj&#xE6;r til Br&#xF8;det.
Om Aftenen sidder de der nede i Hellede og danner Skeer, for de var n&#xF8;dt til at tage Tiden i Betragtning. Saa lige med et siger Karlen: "De har lavet noget godt &#xD8;l oppe i Himmerig i Dag." &#x2014; "Ja, det har de," siger Manden, "hvem der havde haft sig en Drik af det." &#x2014; "Ja, det kan vi sagt faa," mente Karlen, og de to Mandfolk snakker ved saa l&#xE6;nge, til de kommer til Rette om at hente &#xD8;llet. Karlen sp&#xE6;nder Studene for, og de faar en tom T&#xF8;nde i Vognen og rumler der op i N&#xE6;rheden. Mens nu Manden holder ved Studene, da bar Karlen &#xD8;llet ud i T&#xF8;nden, saa l&#xE6;nge til der var kun en bitte Slat i Bunden, den lod han staa, og saa satte han Karret paa Kant. Imens nu Manden kj&#xF8;rte hjem med &#xD8;llet, gik han selv ind og tog den gamle Madamme, der laa paa Straa, og bar hende ud og satte hende paa hovedet ned i den Smule &#xD8;l, der var tilbage. Om Morgenen, det f&#xF8;rste Manden vaagnede, raabte han ad hans Kone og sagde: "Aa h&#xF8;r, v&#xE9;d du hvad, l&#xF8;b ub og hent mig en Taar af det nye &#xD8;l, a er da saa knust&#xF8;rstig." Det var jo en L&#xE6;kkermund, kan vi nok forstaa. Hun gik ogsaa derud og fandt Karret, og hun m&#xE6;rkede noget koldt, der laa der nede, men vidste ikke, hvad det var, og l&#xF8;b saa ind til Manden igjen og fortalte ham det. De fulgtes begge ad derud med Lyset, og saa kunde de jo se, hvad det var. "Naa da, da har hun drukket godt, hun har drukket alt &#xD8;llet. Men vi maa jo helst s&#xF8;rge for at faa bagt, da vi har stilt an."&#x2014;"Ja, det maa vi helst,' og de bager saa den Dag og faar Br&#xF8;dene af Ovnen og faar dem sat paa Enden i Bagetruget, som Skik og Brug er.
Saa gik de til Sengs der oppe, de var jo noget tr&#xE6;tte af Dagens Travlhed, men dem der nede i Hellede de gjorde ikke. De hentede Br&#xF8;dene og dragede hjem med dem, og faa lagde de den gamle langs hen ad Truget. Men f&#xF8;rst tog de en Skalk og overtyggede den lidt, saadan at Folkene bedre kunde komme i Tanker om, at det var hende, der havde spist Br&#xF8;dene, og den Skalk laa hun med i H&#xE6;nderne. Anden Dags Morgen, da de nu ser, hvordan Sagerne staar, siger Manden: "I Dag vil vi ikke brygge, for oven paa saadant et Maaltid kan hun missel gj&#xE6;rne tr&#xE6;nge til noget at drikke, og saa beholder vi jo ikke noget af det. Men i Morgen vil vi have Studen slagtet, for vi vil lige godt se, om hun i Nat kan gaa ud og &#xE6;de en levende Stud. Kan hun gj&#xF8;re det, saa skal der andre Kneb til."
Hen ved Aftenstid da gik Manden ned til Hellede og fik Lov opaa Manden der, at Karlen maatte komme op og holde ved Studen anden Dags Morgen, og saa blev Aftalen, at han skulde m&#xF8;de Klokken seks. Det var omkring ved Jul, saa det var jo tidlig, og det var endnu helt m&#xF8;rkt; men det var alligevel ikke for tidlig at faa begyndt paa Slagteriet.
Sildig paa Aftenen siger Karlen: "Det lod til, ligesom de var r&#xE6;dde for at miste deres Stud. Vi kunde jo gj&#xE6;rne skaane dem for den Ulejlighed, de t&#xE6;nker paa at have med den." - "Aanej," siger Manden, "det kan aldrig gaa, husk paa, te de er tredje Gang." Det sagde han jo, for det han var lidt overtroisk. "Ja, du v&#xE9;d nok," siger Karlen, "te alle gode Gange det er tre," og saa var der jo ikke noget at sige. De fulgtes ad op efter Studen, fik den lykkelig og vel ud af N&#xF8;dset og trukken hjem og slagtet med det samme. Saa var det til Side. Bag efter tog Karlen halen, skar den af og gik op til Himmerig med den. Der gik han ind og hentede Konen og lagde hende saa i Studens Baas. Men hendes Bent&#xF8;j det lagde han i Klaven, og hendes hoved vendte han ud mod Gr&#xE6;vningen. Derefter stoppede han Studehalen i Munden af hende, og saa gik han hjem.
Om Morgenen Klokken segs, som Aftalen var bleven, stillede han oppe ved Gaarden igjen. De var ikke kommen op, og saa kaldte han paa Manden. "Jaja," siger han henne i Sengen, "kom inden for, vi kan faa os en Bid Br&#xF8;d f&#xF8;rst." Han kommer jo ogsaa ind. "Ja, nu skal du ikke skaane ved," siger Manden, "at tage for dig af Retterne, for du kan tro, du vil faa dine Kr&#xE6;fter n&#xF8;dig. Karlen lod sig det ikke sige to Gange, og tog dygtig for sig af Retterne. Da de var f&#xE6;rdige, gik de ud i N&#xF8;dset og de havde jo Lygten med. "Ja, den staar enlig i sin Baas," siger Manden, idet de gaar over Gaarden, "den er nem at finde, og den staar lige her ved Siden af D&#xF8;ren." Saa lukker de D&#xF8;ren op. "Ja, a kan ingen Stud se," siger Karlen. "Og er det en Stud, saa er det mins&#xE6;l en af de smaa da." "Forvar jer," siger Manden, "lad mig komme til med Lygten. I kan jo ingen Ting se." Da han nu kommer og faar rigtig set til, da havde han n&#xE6;r smidt Lygten af ene Forskr&#xE6;kkelse, for der laa den gamle Kone og havde helt gjort det af med Studen, saa n&#xE6;r som den lille Stump hale, den kunde hun ikke have med at skaffe. "Ja," siger Manden, "nu du har set saa meget, saa kan a lige godt fort&#xE6;lle det hele," og saa fortalte han, hvordan det altsammen var gaaet til lige fra det f&#xF8;rste og til det sidste.
"Kan du nu sige mig et Raad," siger han til Karlen, "hvordan vi Skal blive hende ledig."&#x2014;"Ja&#x2014;, a ved jo &#xE9;t Raad," siger Karlen, "men det er lidt dyrt." &#x2014; "Og det er?" "Ja &#x2014; a, hun skal manes, der er ikke andet at gj&#xF8;re ved hende." &#x2014; "Ja, hvem kan gj&#xF8;re det?" &#x2014; "J&#x2014;a, a kan sige dig &#xE9;n, og det er ingen andre end mig selv, a kan justement gj&#xF8;re det og vil ogsaa da, men a vil have det godt betalt, for mislykkes det, saa er det mig, det kommer til at gaa ud over." &#x2014; "Ja, hvor meget mener du, du skal have?" &#x2014; "Aa, vil du give mig 25 Specier, saa vil a gj&#xF8;re det." &#x2014; "Ja &#x2014; a, det er jo mange Penge," siger Manden, "men n&#xE6;renstid a kan v&#xE6;re forvisset paa, hun skal ikke komme igjen, vil a ogsaa gaa ind paa det." &#x2014; "Ja," siger Karlen, "a stiller ikke andre Betingelser, end a kj&#xF8;rer hjem efter vort Kj&#xF8;ret&#xF8;j, for du vil vel ikke laane mig dit. Vi har jo ikke andet end Stude, og det skulde jo rigtig nok helst have v&#xE6;ret B&#xE6;ster." &#x2014; "Jo, det vil a saa meget gj&#xE6;rne," siger Manden. "Jaja, saa skal hun vaskes ren over hele hendes Krop, og hun skal i en ren S&#xE6;rk, og saa skal vi have hende i hendes Alterskl&#xE6;der, for hun stal kl&#xE6;des paa baade med Kl&#xE6;der og Kaabe, ligesom hun ellers blev kl&#xE6;dt paa i levende Live, n&#xE6;renstid det var koldt. Saa er der kun det tilbage: De tre f&#xF8;rste Maanem&#xE6;rker maa I ikke snakke om hende her i Gaarden, for hvis det sker, saa vil a ikke indestaa for F&#xF8;lgerne. Det kunde jo ske, I kunde komme til at &#xF8;nske hende tilbage, og det blev v&#xE6;rst for mig." &#x2014; "Ja, n&#xE6;renstid der er ikke andet end det," siger Manden, "det kan vi sagt overholde og gaa ind paa alt sammen."
Saa fik Karlen hende i hendes fulde Stads, og derefter kj&#xF8;rte han med hende. Nu var det faldt ind med Frostvejr, og han mente nok, hun kunde blive ved at holde sig lidt endnu, saa han kj&#xF8;rer til Aarhus med hende. Det f&#xF8;rste hun kommer der ind, saa kj&#xF8;rer han hen for en Skomagers D&#xF8;r og holder der. Saa gaar han ind og siger: "H&#xF8;r, Hr. Skomager, a har en gammel Moder, der sidder her ude i Vognen, du skulde da vel ikke have haft set saadan, te en kunde faa et Par St&#xF8;vler til hende, hun kan ikke vel n&#xE6;re sig med dem, hun har." &#x2014; "Det har jeg jo nok," siger Skomageren, "men jeg skulde helst vide, hvor stor Foden var." &#x2014; "Ja, det kan du jo gaa ud og snakke med hende om, men du kommer til at snakke lidt h&#xF8;jt, for hun er noget tungh&#xF8;rende." Skomageren gaar saa ud til hende og siger, om hun vil ikke fly ham hendes Fod, han kan se, hvor stor den er. Men hun svarte ikke. Saa bliver han hidsig, han skal staa der og pr&#xE6;ke med hende saa l&#xE6;nge, og endelig griber han i Foden. Men hun var jo lidt stiv, og saa Vipper han hende over i noget Skramleri, Karlen havde bag i Vognen. "Nej holdt," siger han, det gj&#xF8;r Karlen, "a vil nok have St&#xF8;vler til hende, men have hovedet flaaet i Stykker paa hende, det bryder a mig ikke om."&#x2014; "Ak, den lebendige Kj&#xE6;lling," siger Skomageren, "hun kan Vel taale et Skrup &#x2014; for han rev lidt paa det tyske &#x2014;; " men saa viste det sig alligevel, at hun ikke havde kunnet taale det Skrup, for hun var slaaet stend&#xF8;d. "Ja holdt nu, go Karl, nu skal du i Retten." Saa begynder Skomageren at klage sig: "Ak nej, det maa du ikke gj&#xF8;re, jeg har baade Kone og B&#xF8;rn, kan vi ikke komme til Rette i Mindelighed?" Saa snakker de sammen, og det blev saadan, at Skomageren skulde give 25 Specier, og saa skulde Karlen frafalde Sagen.
Saa kj&#xF8;rte han ogsaa ud af Byen. "Nu maa a vel egentlig helst se at komme hjem, for hvem kan vide, om det ikke kunde blive opdaget." Han tog saa Vejen om ad H&#xF8;ve og efter Vissing, og da der i de Dage var Kroerer, som der er endnu, saa kj&#xF8;rte Karlen ind i Kroeret. Nu var den Kromand bekjendt for at v&#xE6;re saadan et knusendes hidsigt Menneneske, og saa kommer Karlen ind til ham og siger: "H&#xF8;r, kan a ikke faa dig til at gaa ud og give min Moder et godt Glas Drikkelse, det kan hun tr&#xE6;nge til, for det fryser klingrendes haardt i Dag." &#x2014; "Ja, har du noget at betale med?" siger Kromanden, "saa kan det nok lade sig gj&#xF8;re." &#x2014; "Jo, v&#xE6;rsgo, her er Penge." Da Kromanden havde faaet Pengene, saa skyndte han sig jo med Drikkelset. "Hun er lidt tungh&#xF8;rende," siger Karlen, "saa du kommer til at r&#xF8;vsle lidt med hende, inden kan hun ikke forstaa, hvad det er." Han gaar ud til Vognen og snakker til hende; men alt det han raabte, det hjalp ikke, og da han nu ikke var vant til at f&#xE6;rdes med Lempe, saa uden videre giver han hende baade Krus og Indhold lige ind i hovedet. Det Slag det v&#xE6;ltede hun for. "Naa," siger han, det gj&#xF8;r Karlen, der kommer til i det samme, "naa, Gj&#xE6;sterne de bliver behandlede paa den Maade her." &#x2014; "Ja," siger Kromanden, "saadant L&#xE6;ber, saadan Sm&#xF8;relse." &#x2014; "Det er hverken hun eller mig godt tjent med," siger Karlen igjen, "nu ligger hun her." Han begynder at fl&#xE6;tte til Side ved Ansigtet af hende, og det viste sig da, at Kromanden havde ramt hende med Kruset lige midt i Panden, og der var bleven et stort blaat Sted. Da Kromanden fik det at se, saa blev han dog lidt lavm&#xE6;let, og saa siger han: "Det havde a lige godt ikke troet, te a havde slaaet saa haardt til, for det ser jo ud, som hun er d&#xF8;d." &#x2014; "Ja, det er hun, men du vilde vel nok v&#xE6;re saa god at sige mig, hvor det n&#xE6;reste Tingsted det er."&#x2014; "Aa, det er ligevalle dog ikke v&#xE6;rd at tage det saa haardt, vi maa hellere se, om vi ikke kan komme til ens i Mindelighed." &#x2014; "Ja, det er knap nok, a kan det," siger Karlen, "for de vil kanske vide af mig, hvor a har gjort af min Moder. Men er det saadan, det er dig meget om at gj&#xF8;re, vil a lige godt tage B&#xF8;de for hende, saa kommer a vel ud af Sagerne, som a kan bedst." Hvor stor den B&#xF8;de blev, var der ingen der fik at vide, for Kromanden var en velhavende Mand, men den blev vel noget stor.
Saa kj&#xF8;rte han v&#xE6;k fra Kroen, kj&#xF8;rte op ad J&#xE6;vngyde og over ved Bjens M&#xF8;llevad og derpaa op til Nygaard Skov og op gjennem H&#xF8;ve Hule. Se, da han kommer til Munden af Hulen, da var det blevet Aften, og Maanen skinte saa dejlig. Saa ser han, der ligger en Kr&#xE6;mmer og sover, og hans S&#xE6;k laa ved Siden af ham. Da Karlen faar denne her Kr&#xE6;mmer at se, t&#xE6;nker han ved sig selv: "Her kan maaske gj&#xF8;res Forretning, og han tager Posen og h&#xE6;lder alt Krammet ud i Vognen, men Kj&#xE6;llingen tager han og stopper i Posen i Steden, med hovedet op ad. Saa kj&#xF8;rer han ganske forsigtig derfra, indtil han kom oven ud af Skoven, og derefter kj&#xF8;rte han, te det sang i Toldene, derfra og hjem. Saa kj&#xF8;rte han op til Himmerig og leverede B&#xE6;sterne af og takkede for Laan, og da han sagde Godnat, bad han dem huske paa, hvad han havde bedt dem med hensyn til Konen.
Hen ad Klokken halv otte saa vaagner han, det gj&#xF8;r Kr&#xE6;mmeren, og han siger jo til sig selv: "Du har nok sovet vel l&#xE6;nge, Kr&#xE6;sten, men det kan nok naaes endnu. Du kan komme der til N&#xE6;tterdags, naar du skynder dig." Han plejede alle Tider at logere i Himmerig om Natten, og det var altsaa der, han vilde til. Saa begynder han jo at sp&#xE6;nde Posen paa. "A tykkes, den er bleven saa sv&#xE6;r, den Pose," staar han og siger til sig selv, "men a kan vel nok drage den endda. Naar a kommer derop, saa faar a at hvile, og der kan a strags begynde at handle, saa sykker det i Posen." Han vandrede altsaa af Sted og sl&#xE6;bte, saa han kom til at svede ved det; men endelig omsider naaer han dertil, og han kommer ind, ligesom de sidder og spiser N&#xE6;tter. "Godaften og Gudsfred!" siger han. "Tak," siger han, det gjorde Manden, "det er jo Kr&#xE6;sten."&#x2014; "Ja, det er sku saa mig selv og ingen andre."&#x2014; "Det er l&#xE6;nge siden du har vaaer her nu, Kr&#xE6;sten." &#x2014; "Ja, a kommer og lige fra Hamborg af, den Vej render en ikke ind i to Dage." &#x2014; "Ja, da saa s&#xE6;t dig herhen til Bordet og faa lidt til din N&#xE6;tter."&#x2014;"Ja Tak," siger han og de spiste. Da de var saa omtrent f&#xE6;rdige, siger han: "A tykkes, a savner et Menneske." &#x2014; "Naa, det gj&#xF8;r du." siger Manden, og det var saadan lidt studs. "Ja, vor gamle Moder, hvor er hun henne?" siger Kr&#xE6;mmeren igjen,  "Hun er d&#xF8;d," siger han, det gj&#xF8;r Manden. Saa var de f&#xE6;rdige med N&#xE6;tteren, og Kr&#xE6;sten faar hans Pose sat op paa Bordet i det samme. "Aa Herre Gud, den Sj&#xE6;l," siger han, "da gad a nok set hende endnu en Gang, det var en skj&#xF8;n Kvinde at tale med." Som han siger det, har han l&#xF8;ft op for Posen, og saa stikker Madammen hovedet der ud af. "Hvad er dether!" siger Kr&#xE6;sten, "ii, det er jo min S&#xE6;l den gamle," og der blev jo en Forf&#xE6;rdelse over det i hele Forsamlingen. "Vi er blevne forb&#xF8;jen," siger Manden, "at &#xF8;nske hende her til, og saadan en Landstryger skal saa komme og f&#xF8;re os i det Uf&#xF8;re!" Det kommer til Skj&#xE6;ldsmaal imellem ham og Kr&#xE6;mmeren, og omsider fik jo Kr&#xE6;mmeren Historien at vide, hvordan det var gaaet til. Saa str&#xF8;g han derfra, det villeste han havde l&#xE6;rt, han vilde ikke have med deres V&#xE6;rt at skaffe.
Om anden Dags Morgen stillede Manden nede ved Karlen og fortalte ham, hvordan det hele var gaaet til, og saa bad han ham nok saa mindelig, om han vilde ikke s&#xE6;tte hende hen igjen, hellers vidste han ingen Raad. "Ja," siger han Karlen, "nu skal a gj&#xF8;re det &#xE9;n Gang til, og saa skal hun nok blive henne, men den Gang vil a have 12 Specier for det, og saa skal du sv&#xF8;be hende i et Jordelagen, hun skal ingen andre Ting v&#xE6;re i." Karlen tog saa en Skubkarre og kj&#xF8;rte derop, og der satte han hende paa den, og saa kj&#xF8;rte han hende ned i Siem D&#xF8;jer (Dyndhuller) og mante hende der. Men siden den Dag har det ogsaa sp&#xF8;gt paa det Sted.

    <english_publication>West of Svejstrup is Siem Town, and on the eastern edge of Siem there&#x2019;s a farm that&#x2019;s called Brandstrup farm. As long as people can remember it&#x2019;s been an outlying farm and built up. About halfway between Brandstrup and Hvidsminde there was another farm, and the farm was well off since the earth there was so much better, but at Brandstrup farm there was poverty and nothing else. Because of that, the places were called Hell and Heaven.
     One evening, around November, the farmer in Hell sat and talked to his wife and said they couldn&#x2019;t pay what they owed and they&#x2019;d be forced to give up, unless they figured something out. She told him that he should find a good strong farmhand and work hard on the land, then they should be able to get food from a field such as theirs. He thought the advice was sound and he went to Ry market where, in those days, there was a general market. When he gets down here to Glentholm, they called it Ry Mill in those days, he catches up with a big farmhand, and they went along and talked together. It turned out that they were headed to find the same thing and they reach an agreement about halfway there. They went back home and the pay was going to be that the farmhand was to get what the farmer could afford, and when the farmer later gave up farming, he was to get the property (the house and everything). They come home to the wife and the farmer says to her: &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s the farmhand. He&#x2019;s a little bit big, but we&#x2019;ll probably get the food.&#x201D;
     &#x201C;Things look pretty meager here,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;but it can probably be made better. Do you have anything to drive with?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, we do,&#x201D; says the farmer, &#x201C;we have a pair of oxen and a wagon.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Do you have any empty sacks?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, we have so many that we can easily drive to the mill for the sacks&#x2019; sake. But we have to stay away, since we don&#x2019;t have any grain.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, just give me the sacks,&#x201D; says the farmhand, and he got all that they had. Then he drove out into a pit and filled them with sand, two measures in some and four in others, depending on whether they were to be for flour or meal or bread, and then he drives off to the mill.
     Back then it wasn&#x2019;t like it is now; back then one unhitched the horses and each man carried his own sacks in. When he came in with them, he had to pay attention, and then when the one right in front of him had finished milling, he had to throw his grain into the hopper, otherwise he wouldn&#x2019;t get his grain milled that day. That&#x2019;s how it went back then. The farmhand goes and blabbers for so long that the next one comes in, and the newcomer winds up milling on top of the one who was right in front of the farmhand. Then he goes over to the master journeyman and complains to him, such and such had happened, couldn&#x2019;t he give him some advice about how to handle the situation. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; says the master journeyman, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have any advice for that, you&#x2019;ll have to wait to tomorrow or until we&#x2019;re finished late tonight.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;But I absolutely have to get back home,&#x201D; and he slips the journeyman a mark. &#x201C;Sure, well now, I&#x2019;ll tell you something. Keep an eye out, when someone comes and is going to have a sack taken away, you can come up first, take it away and put your own sack in its place.&#x201D;
     He was so good at doing that that he got the one sack after another, all of it good grain, and then he drives home with the whole load.
     Then they baked bread and since they had borrowed so many loaves of bread from Heaven in the past, they sent a new loaf up to them as a start. There was an old woman up there in that farm and she was so incredibly curious about the new farmhand they&#x2019;d gotten. The wife from Hell went up with the bread herself, and she was getting quite tired of the old woman&#x2019;s chatting and complained about it when she got home. Then the farmhand says, &#x201C;Well, wait just a little while, then she&#x2019;ll have more to think about. Now, you can go up and borrow their measure.&#x201D; So she did that and then she brought it back the next day. The old woman wanted to get hold of the measure immediately to inspect it, and there was a L&#xFC;beck coin stuck in between the tines down in the bottom. &#x201C;No, lookie here,&#x201D; says the old woman, &#x201C;now I sure as heck can say what they&#x2019;ve used this measure for, they&#x2019;ve been measuring money with it.&#x201D; But the farmhand had put it there on purpose. The old woman gets so curious about this money that she eventually gets the husband to go down there and get permission to store a chest in the house down there and she wants to be in it herself.
     He goes down there and greets them, wishing them a good evening. The farmhand wasn&#x2019;t home at the moment. &#x201C;Listen,&#x201D; says the farmer, &#x201C;I have a storage chest I want to keep down here, it&#x2019;s full of linen. We&#x2019;re going to have guests and I don&#x2019;t want to put it out in the barn, because the bugs could get in there and spoil the linen; and it wouldn&#x2019;t be so good to have it out in the moist air.&#x201D; Sure, says the poor man, he could do that, both he and his house were at his service. The next morning the chest is driven down there, unloaded, and placed next to the wood-burning stove.
     Around noon the farmhand comes back from the woods and sees the chest. He hadn&#x2019;t heard about this arrangement. &#x201C;Hunh, how did this get here?&#x201D; he says. They tell him. &#x201C;Well, there&#x2019;s something else behind this.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t going to break the chest open.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;It won&#x2019;t matter,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;we can always close it up again.&#x201D; He opens it up and the old witch is sitting there and she throws a couple of really big wooden plates at them. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s quite a rough game, now I&#x2019;ll see if I can&#x2019;t satisfy her curiosity.&#x201D; He takes his hatchet and hits her in the forehead with it. She couldn&#x2019;t quite handle that and she immediately dies. &#x201C;Well, well,&#x201D; says the wife, &#x201C;you&#x2019;re quite a young man, killing off an old person. What are we going to do now, when it gets discovered?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, it will never be discovered,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;now you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201D; Then he takes one of the biggest sausages and shoves it into her mouth, so that it can&#x2019;t budge either forward or backward. Then he carefully closes the chest again and lets her be.
     The man from Heaven drove down and picked her up at the end of the day, and he hadn&#x2019;t gotten too far from the place when he began to talk to her, but she didn&#x2019;t answer. Then he thought, &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll see if I can&#x2019;t liven her up a bit,&#x201D; and he drove down one rock pile and over another. But it didn&#x2019;t help, she didn&#x2019;t say as much as a peep. &#x201C;Well, how is my mother?&#x201D; said his wife when he came back up to the farm. &#x201C;Well, you can ask her yourself, since I sure as heck am pretty darn sick of it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, you are, are you? Well let&#x2019;s get her down off the wagon, because she might be sick of lying in that chest herself.&#x201D; They unloaded her and brought her in and opened it up. &#x201C;Well there you have it,&#x201D; says the wife. &#x201C;I often warned her, that poor old thing, that she should eat in moderation, and now it&#x2019;s gone and done her in.&#x201D; They took her and lay her on straw and began thinking about her funeral, there was nothing else they could do. They hitched up the horses and drove to the mill and as soon as they got home, they began to brew so they could have some yeast for the bread. 
     At night they sit down there in Hell making spoons, since they had to make use of all their time. Then all of a sudden, the farmhand says: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve made some good beer up in Heaven today.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, they have,&#x201D; says the husband, &#x201C;everyone who has had a taste of it says that.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, we can certainly get a taste,&#x201D; says the farmhand, and those two guys talk about it for a while and they decide to go get the beer. The farmhand hitches up the oxen and they put an empty barrel in the wagon and rumble up nearby. While the husband holds the oxen, the farmhand carries out the beer in the barrel, until there was only a little puddle left in the bottom of the brewing tub, he left that there, and then he put the tub up on its side. While the man drives home, the farmhand goes in and takes the old woman who is lying on straw and puts her headfirst into the little bit that was left. The next morning, the first thing the husband [from Heaven] does when he wakes up is to call to his wife and says, &#x201C;Hey, listen, could you go out and get me a taste of the new beer, I&#x2019;m so incredibly thirsty.&#x201D; You see he had a real soft spot for treats. She goes out there, too, and she finds the tub, and there was something cold lying in there, but she didn&#x2019;t know what it was and she ran in and told her husband. They both went out there with a candle and they could see what it was. &#x201C;Well, well, you&#x2019;ve drunk well, she&#x2019;s drunk all the beer. But we better make sure we bake, since we&#x2019;ve gotten everything ready for that.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, we&#x2019;d better,&#x201D; and then they bake that day and get the bread out of the oven and they put the loaves on their ends in the baking trough as is the custom.
     Then they went to bed up there, they were a bit tired from the busy day, but the ones down in Hell didn&#x2019;t. They [the man and the farmhand from Hell] went up to Heaven and got the loaves of bread and took them home and they laid the old one out along the baking trough. But first they took a crust of bread and chewed it a bit so it&#x2019;d be more likely that the ones from Heaven would think that it was she who&#x2019;d eaten the bread and she lay there with that crust in her hands. The next morning, when they saw how things stood, the husband [from Heaven] says, &#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t going to brew today because on top of a meal like that, she&#x2019;ll probably need something to drink, and then we won&#x2019;t be able to keep any of it. But tomorrow, we can slaughter the ox, since we can see if she can go out tonight and eat a living ox. If she can do that, then we&#x2019;ll have to do something else.&#x201D;
     Around evening time, the husband there goes down to Hell and gets permission to have the farmhand come and hold the ox the following morning so that they can slaughter it, and they agree that he is to come up there at six in the morning. It was right about Christmastime, and so that was early, and it was completely dark; but it still wasn&#x2019;t too early to start slaughtering.
     Late that evening, the farmhand says, &#x201C;It almost sounded like they were afraid of losing their ox. We could easily spare them the trouble they think they&#x2019;re going to have with him.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh no,&#x201D; said the husband, &#x201C;it will never work, remember that this is the third time.&#x201D; He said that because he was a little superstitious. &#x201C;Yes, we all probably know,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;that all good things happen in threes,&#x201D; and then there was nothing else to say. They went up together to get the ox, got it safely out of the barn, and got it home and slaughtered it immediately. Then that was out of the way. Afterward, the farmhand took the tail, cut it off, and went up to Heaven with it. Then he went in and got the [dead] woman and put her in the ox&#x2019;s stall. But he put her legs in the ties and he put her head out toward the gutter. Then he stuffed the tail into her mouth and then he went home.
     The next morning at six o&#x2019;clock, as was agreed, he was up at the farm again. They hadn&#x2019;t gotten up yet, so he calls to the husband. &#x201C;OK, OK,&#x201D; he says from bed, &#x201C;come inside, we can have us a bite of bread first.&#x201D; He goes in too. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be shy,&#x201D; says the husband, &#x201C;take as much as you like since you&#x2019;re going to need all your strength.&#x201D; The farmhand didn&#x2019;t need to be told twice, and he took a lot of food. When they were done, they went out into the barn and had the lamp with them. &#x201C;Yes, it&#x2019;s standing alone in its stall,&#x201D; says the man as they are crossing the farmyard, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s easy to find, it&#x2019;s right here by the door.&#x201D; Then they open the door. &#x201C;Well, I can&#x2019;t see any ox,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;and if it&#x2019;s an ox, then it&#x2019;s certainly one of the small ones.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Watch out,&#x201D; says the husband, &#x201C;let me come with the lamp. You can&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201D; When he comes and gets a good look, he almost dropped the lamp out of fear, because there lay the old woman and she&#x2019;d done away with the entire ox, except for a little piece of tail, she couldn&#x2019;t finish that. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; says the man, &#x201C;since you&#x2019;ve seen this much, I might as well tell you the whole story,&#x201D; and then he told him how things had gone from the beginning to the end.
     &#x201C;Can you give me some advice,&#x201D; he says to the farmhand, &#x201C;how can we get rid of her?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, I know one thing,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;but it is a little expensive.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;And that is?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, uh, she needs to be conjured, there&#x2019;s nothing else to do with her.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, who can do that?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, I can tell you about someone who can, and it's no other than myself, I can do it, and I will gladly do it too, but I need to be paid well for it, because if it goes bad, it will be me who suffers.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, how much do you think you want?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, if you give me twenty-five specier, then I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s a lot of money,&#x201D; says the husband, &#x201C;but if I can be sure that she won&#x2019;t come again, I&#x2019;ll agree to that.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;OK,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll make no other conditions than you let me go home and get our wagon, since you probably don&#x2019;t want to lend me your wagon. We don&#x2019;t have anything other than oxen, and it really should be horses.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Sure, I&#x2019;ll gladly lend you mine,&#x201D; says the husband. &#x201C;Ok, well then she needs to be washed clean over her whole body, and she is to be put in a clean shift, she should be dressed in her church clothes, she is to be dressed in regular clothing with a cape, just like she&#x2019;d be dressed when she was alive when it was cold outside. Then all that&#x2019;s left to do is this: for the first three months, you can&#x2019;t mention her here at the farm, because then I can&#x2019;t say what the consequences might be. It might happen that you&#x2019;d wish her back, and that would be the worst outcome for me.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, as long as there&#x2019;s nothing other than that,&#x201D; says the man, &#x201C;we can certainly observe those rules and go along with all of that.&#x201D;
     Then the farmhand got her in all her finery and then he drove off with her. Now, frost had set in and the farmhand thought she&#x2019;d probably keep for a little while and he drives to &#xC5;rhus with her. As soon as he gets there, he drives up to a cobbler&#x2019;s door and he stops there. Then he goes in and says, &#x201C;Listen here, cobbler, I have an old woman sitting out here in the wagon, do you think you might have a pair of boots for her, she can&#x2019;t continue with the ones she has.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;I probably do,&#x201D; says the cobbler, &#x201C;but I probably better know how big her feet are.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, you can go out and talk to her about that, but you&#x2019;ll have to speak loudly, because she&#x2019;s a little hard of hearing.&#x201D; The cobbler goes out and asks if she couldn&#x2019;t give him her foot, so he can see how big it is. But she didn&#x2019;t answer. Then he gets angry, he&#x2019;s stood there so long, preaching to her and finally he grabs her foot. But she was a little stiff, he knocks her over into some junk the farmhand had there in the back of the wagon. &#x201C;Hey, stop,&#x201D; he says, the farmhand does, &#x201C;sure I want boots for her, but to have her head smashed in, I&#x2019;m not really interested in that.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh, that damn hag,&#x201D; says the cobbler, &#x201C;she can probably take a little push&#x201D;&#x2014;he was a bit on the German side, but then it turned out that she couldn&#x2019;t, because she&#x2019;d been knocked stone dead. &#x201C;Wait a second, my good man, you&#x2019;re going to court.&#x201D; Then the cobbler began to moan, &#x201C;Oh, no, please don&#x2019;t do that, I have a wife and children, can&#x2019;t we come to an agreement?&#x201D; Then they talked to each other and they agreed that the cobbler would give him twenty-five specier and then the farmhand would drop the case.
     Then he drove out of town. &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;d better see about coming home, since who knows if someone might figure this out.&#x201D; Then he took the road past H&#xF8;ve and past Vissing, and in those days there was an inn there as there is now, and so he drove to the inn.
     Now the innkeeper there was known for being a really short-tempered guy and then the farmhand goes in and says, &#x201C;Listen, can&#x2019;t I get you to go out and give my mother a good glass of something to drink, she probably needs it, it&#x2019;s really freezing cold today.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Sure, do you have anything to pay with?&#x201D; says the innkeeper, &#x201C;then I certainly can do it.&#x201D; When the innkeeper had gotten the money, he hurried out with the drink. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s a little hard of hearing,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;so you&#x2019;re going to have to shake her a bit, otherwise she won&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201D; He goes out to the wagon and speaks to her, but it didn&#x2019;t matter how much he shouted and since he wasn&#x2019;t used to dealing with the infirm, without further ado, he throws the mug and its contents at her head. The blow knocked her over. &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; he says, the farmhand does, as he shows up at that moment, &#x201C;so that&#x2019;s how guests are treated here?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; says the innkeeper, &#x201C;that kind of leather, that kind of grease.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Neither she nor I is well served by that,&#x201D; says the farmhand again, &#x201C;now she&#x2019;s lying here.&#x201D; He begins to brush at the side of her face, and it turned out that the mug had hit her right in the middle of the forehead; there was a big black and blue mark there. When the innkeeper saw that, he dropped his voice and then he says, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d hit her that hard because it looks like she is dead.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, she is, and so you&#x2019;ll be good enough to tell me where the closest court is.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh come on, you needn&#x2019;t take it so hard, we should better see if we can&#x2019;t figure something out.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, I can&#x2019;t really do that,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;because they&#x2019;ll want to know what I&#x2019;ve done with my mother. But if it&#x2019;s so that you can do something, then I&#x2019;ll take a fine for her, and then I&#x2019;ll get out of it as best I can.&#x201D; No one found out how big that fine was, because the innkeeper was a wealthy man, but it was certainly pretty big.
     Then he drove off from the inn. He drove up along J&#xE6;vngyde and over by the town&#x2019;s mill and up to Nygaard Woods and up through H&#xF8;ve Hollow. See, when he gets to the mouth of H&#xF8;ve Hollow, it was night and the moon was shining so beautifully. Then he saw a peddler lying there sleeping, and his bag lay beside him. When the farmhand sees this here peddler, he thinks to himself: &#x201C;Maybe I can do some business here,&#x201D; and he takes the peddler&#x2019;s bag and pours all the wares into the wagon, but the old woman he takes and stuffs down into the bag instead, with her head pointing up. Then he drives carefully away, until he gets out of the woods and then he drove home going as fast as he could until the reins sang. Then he drove up to Heaven and delivered the horses and thanked them for loaning them to him and asked them to remember what he&#x2019;d asked them in regard to the woman.
     Around seven thirty, he wakes up, the peddler does, and he says to himself: &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve certainly slept late, Kr&#xE6;sten, but you can probably still make it. You can get there by nightfall, if you hurry.&#x201D; He would always sleep at Heaven at night and that&#x2019;s where he was headed. Then he started to put his bag on. &#x201C;It seems like this bag has gotten so heavy,&#x201D; he stands there and says to himself, &#x201C;but I can certainly drag it up there. When I get up there, I&#x2019;ll get a rest and then I can start selling things right away and then the bag will get lighter.&#x201D; Then he wandered off lugging the bag, and it was so heavy that he wound up sweating; but finally he gets there and comes in just as they&#x2019;re sitting there eating dinner. &#x201C;Good evening and God bless!&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; he says, the husband does, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Kr&#xE6;sten.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, it certainly is me and no one else.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a while since you&#x2019;ve been here, Kr&#xE6;sten.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;m coming straight from Hamburg, you don&#x2019;t walk that road in two days.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, sit down here at the table and have a little dinner.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Why thank you,&#x201D; he says and they ate. When they were more or less done, he says, &#x201C;I seem to be missing a person.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh, you are, are you?&#x201D; says the husband, and it was quiet for a little bit. &#x201C;Yes, our old mother, where is she?&#x201D; says the peddler. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s dead,&#x201D; he says, the husband does.
     Then they were done with dinner and the peddler had put his bag up on the table. &#x201C;Oh dear God, that soul,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;d love to see her one more time, she was a wonderful woman to talk to.&#x201D; As he says that, he&#x2019;s untied his bag and the old woman sticks her head out. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201D; says the peddler, &#x201C;God help me that&#x2019;s the old woman,&#x201D; and the whole group was shocked. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been forbidden,&#x201D; says the man, &#x201C;to wish her here and then a hobo like this comes and brings us into this trouble.&#x201D; They start arguing, him and the peddler, and after a while the peddler learns most of the story, how things had happened. Then he got out of there as fast as he could, he didn&#x2019;t want to have anything to do with their problems.
     The next morning, the husband from Heaven went down to the farmhand at Hell and told him what had happened and asked nicely if he wouldn&#x2019;t please conjure her again, he didn&#x2019;t know what else to do. &#x201C;OK,&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do it one more time, and she&#x2019;ll certainly stay away, but this time I want twelve specier to do it, and I want you to wrap her in a burial cloth, she&#x2019;s not to be in anything else.&#x201D; The farmhand then got a wheelbarrow and drove up there and put her on it and then he drove her down to Siem D&#xF8;jer [the Siem mudholes] and conjured her there. But since then, there&#x2019;s been haunting down there.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The manor lord in this story is not only remarkably wealthy, but also unusually cruel and arrogant. He is more than cut down to size by the girl's relatives. Interestingly, the relatives are manor lords themselves and so the loss of the seven manor farms does not result in a redistribution of wealth to poorer layers of society. Instead the redistribution takes place within the same class. Similarly, the young girl is not from the class of his usual victims: the women he sleeps with and throws into the moat are clearly the children of day laborers and other leasehold farmers, and not the children of farm owners or aristocrats. Nevertheless, the cruelty of the manor lord leads to his demise. His sentence to wander about as a beggar calls to mind stories of the Wandering Jew and also acts as a form of narrative justice.

     The dice game appears to be rigged, and thus the punishment of the Count relies on dishonesty. His wrongs are righted by the wrongs of the other manor lords--cruelty and barbarism are counteracted by dishonesty and immorality. Of course, fighting one inversion with another is a successful strategy in folk narrative to deal with outside threat.

     Unlike his previous stories, Peder makes a point of emphasizing the truth of this narrative. 

     There is little difference between the manuscript and published version of the story.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>At the farm Urup, there was a count J&#xF8;rgen, he was a rich man and owned seven manor farms besides Urup and, whenever he drove in formal finery, he had eight white mares pulling his carriage. The farm was stoutly built, the windowsills were sculpted out of fine stone and there was a drawbridge leading into it from the courtyard and the door posts and the knocker were made out of whalebone. But he was a lecherous fellow, that is to say he stole their girls round about and he had one to lie with every night and afterward he'd throw her into the moat, and then she had to take care of herself, whether she'd make it to land or not. Then he got to thinking that he wanted to get married and he went on down to Venge farm, a rich woman lived there, she only had one daughter. He courted her, and he had his horses shod with gold horse shoes before he rode over there and there was a group of young men who followed along in procession. When he got to the farm, the woman was standing at the gate, so he told her his errand there on his horse. When he was finished, the woman answered: "No, my daughter is not going to have so lecherous a fellow." Then he threatened her but I can't remember what it was since I was only six years old when it was told to me. The woman got out of it by getting five manor lords from her kin go after him, and they cheated him. They gambled with him and when he played, he slammed the dice down on the table so it sang, but nevertheless both Urup and the seven estates were lost before daybreak, and he became such a poor beggar that he went about begging until his death. This is supposed to have really happened.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Pentik&#xE4;inen (1969) would classify the ghost in this story as a guilty haunt because it is the barbaric nature of the manor lord (a parallel to the manor lord in the preceding story) that results in the haunting. 

     The ghost's appearance as a monster with horns is unusual. Not surprisingly, the people at the farm turn to several local ministers to solve the problem, a fairly standard strategy for dealing with haunts, despite the seeming incongruity of Lutheran ministers dealing with a threat (ghosts) that should have disappeared with the Reformation (Tangherlini 1999). The ministers' failure can be read as a stinging indictment of the power of the minister and, by extension, the Lutheran church. In contrast, the beggar, who has no social standing and whose name, Klemmen Unborn, suggests a supernatural liminality, succeeds. The nickname probably refers to his birth by Caesarian section, an operation that was known as early as the sixteenth century when it was used to deliver children whose mothers had died during childbirth (see KMP 1.05). The standing offer of shelter at the manor parallels other stories in which a beggar offers unusual assistance and is rewarded with food and lodgings (see KMP 2.08).

     The published version of the story eliminates the clear narrative connection that Peder makes between this story and the preceding one.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Then there's a manor farm here to the east a bit, they called it Stadsg&#xE5;rd, and they still call it that now. Ghosts haunted there in the old days and it was the earlier owner who went again because he had been so barbaric toward his peasants. He went in the shape of a monster with horns and bustled about a lot in the main room. Nobody dared to be at the farm at night because of him. So they gathered the ministers together--there were twelve altogether--one night at midnight. They came in the evening and they were also fed before they were to go to it. Then at twilight, a beggar came, he was otherwise known as Klemmen Unborn because he had been cut out of his mother's side, and he asked for lodgings for the night. But they said no. First of all, they didn't have a reasonable room to give him, and second of all, he couldn't very well be there when everyone else had fled from there, how was he going to handle himself, only these twelve chaps were going to be there. "Yes," he says to them, "just let me stay, who knows what it could be good for. Maybe these fine gentleman could find use for his help in a little bit." -- "Sure," says one of the people to him, "if you aren't any more afraid that you offer to help them, well then there's a bed here in the hall next to the main room, you can go in there and lie down." So he went in there and on toward midnight, these twelve ministers arranged themselves in a circle in the main room, each one with a psalm book or whatever in their hands, and they open them up and begin to make quite a ruckus with songs and prayers and what have you. Then when the clock struck, the door burst open and in comes this monster and, for every nod it made toward a minister, his psalm book flew out of his hands. Then he says, Klemmen, he did: "Now it's my turn, I guess." Then he went in there and there was nobody who could understand what he said, but the animal stood still and so he went over and bound a red thread around it's horns and then he pulled it out to the south-east corner of the farm, where there was a large linden tree in those days, and he tied it (the monster) to it (the tree) until the next day when he conjured it down. After that, he didn't have to ask to get lodgings at that farm.</english_manuscript>

Then he says, Klemmen, he did: &#x201C;Now it&#x2019;s my turn, I guess.&#x201D; So he went in there and there was nobody who could understand what he said, but the animal stood still and so he went over and bound a red thread around its horns. Then he pulled it out to the south-east corner of the farm where there was a large linden tree in those days, and he tied the monster to the tree until the next day when he conjured it down. After that, he didn&#x2019;t have to ask to get lodgings at that farm.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Variants of legends concerning theft from supernatural beings, most commonly mound dwellers, are widely attested (see AMJ 1.19 and KMP 1.61). The elaborate taxonomies that some scholars propose to differentiate between supernatural beings is hard to reconcile with stories such as this one. Although the tradition dominant for the story proposes mound dwellers, Peder clearly chooses the more seductive female elves to fulfill the motifemic slot of supernatural threat. Svend Felding proves himself more clever than the elves, managing to get both his wish and the drinking chalice. Peder makes no mention of what becomes of the drinking chalice. In other variants of the story, the chalice is used to build a church--the theft from the supernatural outsiders is made acceptable since the proceeds are not used for personal gain, but rather for the good of the community (Ball 2009; DS I 818). Felding was a well known figure in local legends (DS I 960; DS I 962). His enormous appetite offers an amusing contrast to the equally strong nisse who survives on a bowl of porridge that he receives but once a year (AMJ 2.16).

     The expression "snild i Bygning" is somewhat ambiguous. It has been translated here as "good at building," but it can also be translated as "really well built", in which case the elves do not want him for his abilities but rather for his body.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories of unwed mothers who haunt are well known throughout Scandinavia (DS V 1171). Many of these stories tell of women who die undelivered and who subsequently haunt. Often they are solicitous, and ask for clothes for their child (DS V 1158; DS V 1164).

     The incidence of out of wedlock birth in rural Denmark was high, but not overwhelming, and so it is unlikely that many women would see such a birth as a terrible problem. Rather, the problem lies in the adultery committed by the two.

     Revealing the father's identity was a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it would ease the childbirth, but on the other hand, it would lead to censure for her and the feed hand. Despite the girl's fatal attempt at cover-up, her death and haunting acts as en even greater disruptive force than if she had simply named the father. Here the disruption goes beyond the feed hand's immediate family, and threatens the economy of the entire farm. Danish laws required that unwed mothers provide the name of their child's father. Not providing the name was, consequently, illegal.

     Peder clearly endorses the strategy of using the minister to counteract the threat posed by haunts (Tangherlini 1999). Pentik&#xE4;inen determined that engaging a solicitous haunt in conversation usually eliminated the haunting (1969). Even though the details of the negotiation remain a secret, the identity of the father must have been revealed in the conversation between the ghost and minister since he is identified in the story's orientation.

     In Danske Sagn, this story is attributed to an unknown informant in Alken. There is nothing in the manuscript that supports this attribution, and the next story Peder tells is directly related to this story.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories about interrogating the dead are widely attested (DS V 820). Here, the farmhand unwittingly breaks a prohibition against witnessing supernatural encounters with the dead or the devil (DS V 728). Consequently, he suffers greatly and never recovers his faculties. The minister presumably wakes the suicide to find out the cause of his action and, quite possibly, to offer the last rites.

     The sanction against suicide was strong, and suicides were buried in the least favorable part of the cemetery, if they were buried in consecrated ground at all (AMJ 1.06 and 3.03). The burial of suicides was a task often given the natm&#xE6;nd [night men; refuse workers] (KMP 1.26). The motif of the minister waking the suicide and asking him questions is not uncommon (AMJ 1.06 and 3.03).

    <annotation>These two linked stories about school offer a fleeting glimpse into the conditions in the rural schools. Reforms in the school system up through the 1860s led to significantly better teacher training and the abolition of harsh corporal punishment. Discipline was often a problem at the schools, yet the measures taken by Niels Ring would be considered extreme at any time (see N&#xF8;rr 1994). The amusing episode with the cheese rind relies on a fairly elaborate play on words for its humor: "at have en skalk i nakken" is an expression meaning to be cunning. "At f&#xE5; en skalk i halsen" substitutes "at f&#xE5;" for "at have" and "halsen" (throat) for "nakken" (neck) and, while it literally means "to have a rind caught in one's throat", it is close enough to the expression for "cunning" that it sets up a humorous cognitive dissonance, since someone choking on a cheese rind can hardly be characterized cunning.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>The parish clerk in Svejstrup, Niels Ring, he was so harsh, one time he punished a young girl by lifting up her clothes around her and putting her bare bottom up on a glowing wood-burning stove so long that her skin was half burned when she came back down.

He's the oldest parish clerk that I know about. The next parish clerk was S&#xF8;ren Jul. He was a clever man, but strict, and when he got angry he'd throw all the boys together in a heap and then he'd walk all over them with his leather-soled clogs and then he'd yell, "You Goddamn wolf children!" But regardless of how strict he was, they still played tricks, they did those boys. One of them was called Mads, he'd been born up at his great grandmother's house. So one day he'd gotten off to a bit of a late start, and when he got to school, he wasn't even finished with his breakfast, since he arrived chewing on a cheese rind and a piece of bread. When he gets to school, the parish clerk had just started the lessons. Then his desk mate, Niels Rebsl&#xE5;er, sees his chance and while Mads is sitting there chewing on the cheese rind, he reaches out and shoves it down his throat and so Mads is sitting there and couldn't get the rind either up or down. The other children began to laugh and the parish clerk couldn't control them. "What is going on?" he asks them gruffly. Immediately, Niels Rebsl&#xE5;er jumps up and says, "It's Mads, he's cunning (he's got a rind stuck in his throat)!" Regardless of how strict he was, the parish clerk couldn't help laughing, but they both had to go and get spanked anyway.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The ghost is presumably that of a woman who died in childbirth (PJ 2.04). The request for burial clothes for the child is a common motif in the Nordic dead child tradition (Pentik&#xE4;inen 1968; DS V 1157, 1163, 1171). In Peter's story, trying to meet the demands of the ghost is clearly the best strategy, as the person survives the encounter relatively unscathed.</annotation>

    <annotation>Midnight is a dangerous time to be out because it is a truly liminal period, on the border between one day and the next (van Gennep 1909; Turner 1969). The young man should be inside and asleep, but instead he is far from the farm or the village boundaries, out in the relative wild of the heath. It is not surprising, then, that he meets a supernatural being. 

     The boy's strategy for dealing with the confrontational haunt relies on Christian symbolism. The motif of the "found cross" (an intersection, crossed furrows, or other phenomena in the landscape that coincidentally make the shape of the cross) as effective against supernatural attack is a common feature of stories of encounters with supernatural outsiders, such as ghosts, witches and mound folk (see AMJ 2.20 and 3.08; KMP 1.19 and 1.61). 

     Although the young man escapes from his encounter with the ghost unscathed, the experience does change his behavior.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories of buried treasure are common in Denmark (DS III 2198, 2228, 2233, 2256, 2292, 2296; see also Lindow 1982). There are also many stories about churches or church bells that sink to the bottom of lakes as a form of divine punishment for the transgressions of the minister or parishioners (DS III 528, 529, 531, 533). Peder combines both motifs in this account.

     The minister's ungodliness causes the church, perhaps the clearest symbol of the human community, to sink into the water, rendering it useless. That the church is still visible acts as an ongoing reminder to the fate that can befall the ungodly.

     The parishioners' attempt to seize the treasure is also worthy of censure. In stories of the drinking cup stolen from the mound folk, the cup is most often used to build a church, or in some other way figures in the communal treasure kept at the church. The church itself stands as a form of community treasure as it represents the clearest protection against the various threatening supernatural forces that confront the human community. 

     The goal of the treasure hunt is personal enrichment, as opposed to the communal enrichment espoused by the drinking cup theft narratives. Not surprisingly, the treasure hunt fails (Lindow 1982). The apparent conflagration engulfing the town that interrupts the erstwhile treasure hunters, a common motif in these stories, is a clear physical representation of the destruction of the community's social structures that would ensue if their treasure hunt were to succeed. 

     The treasure hunters' solitary pursuit of wealth contradicts the ideal of community solidarity, yet aligns well with the emerging capitalist economy and incentives for individual success. The "limited good" model suggests that any such personal gain would come at the expense of others in the community; the new, capitalist model stressing individual initiative and success proposes an "unlimited good" model, where one man's fortune is not necessarily congruent with others' misfortune (Foster 1965).</annotation>

    <annotation>The treasure described here, a "king's ransom," is the amount of money it would take to get a king ransomed, presumably a fabulously enormous sum (PJ 3.23). Peder includes two widely attested beliefs: first, the belief in the existence of the "Black School," in this case located in Copenhagen (as opposed to the more common location in Wittenberg) (see DS VI 75; DS VI 95) and second, the belief that candles burn for treasure (DS III 2164; DS III 2168). An unusual feature of Peder's story is that the candle burns for everything but treasure. The discussion of the stones with inscriptions on it is reminiscent of Bitte Jens's story of the rune stone found out in a field (BJK 3.03).

     The treasure hunt proceeds in a markedly similar manner to the fishing expedition in the preceding story (PJ 2.09). Here, the disturbance comes from a host of unusual or unexpected animals, another common motif. The farmhand's outburst confirms that the animals are the spawn of Satan. The appearance of an elk further underscores this connection (see KMP 1.36). 

     The individual pursuit of wealth, with its implicit disavowal of the community, aligns well with the destructive tendencies of Satan. At the same time, it also aligns well with the newly emergent market economies, where untold wealth could be obtained in one fell swoop (Taussig 1980).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There's a king's ransom out in Silkeborg forest and a large oak stands over it, but it's sanded over. There was a man who invested a lot on digging it out and they had dug so far down that they had come to the roots of the oak. They got that far but no farther, just as fast as they dug, [the sand] slid back in. They could work as hard as they wanted, they couldn't get any farther down. My grandfather was at another place where there was a king's ransom. It was by the side of a mound and when one stands on the mound and looks down at a certain time, four o'clock in the afternoon, and looks straight down at the foot of it then one can see a large square stone with inscriptions on it. But it's illegible and if one goes to look, then there is nothing but earth. They'd dug after that too and they'd also found the stone but this man was more careful than most others who dig for that kind of thing since he had gone over to the Black School in Copenhagen and he had gotten himself a blue candle there. Wherever the candle burns, there is no treasure to be found, where it goes out, that's where one should look, that is where the treasure is. It turned out to be true enough because, when he lit the candle, it burned every place except there, it couldn't burn there. Then he and his farmhand started to dig for it and all sorts of animals came and wanted to disturb them because they couldn't speak or leave. They had gotten so far that they had the handle of the kettle. Then a giant buck elk appears and it begins to scrape his hand, the one who had hold of the one axe, and then he couldn't keep quiet any longer and said: "No, if you're Old Erik himself, I won't let go." All of a sudden, without them being able to understand it, the men and the picks and shovels lay on each their side of the mound and it was leveled like it had never been dug up before. They tried to dig again but they never got to it again because a king's ransom sinks twice as deep the next time when someone has dug for it.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>The dance of the mound dwellers is widely attested in Danish folk narrative (DS I 717, 748, 755). Here, the dance is quite energetic and the mound is raised on four glowing poles, suggesting that the dance takes place at night. The little man keeping watch over the dance wears the typical red stocking hat of the Danish farm worker. The red stocking hat is well-known as part of the standard attire of the farm guardian spirit, the nisse and has also been adopted in contemporary culture for Santa Claus's little helpers.

     After his generalized description of the mound dwellers' dance, Peder relates a more specific legend of kidnapping. Here, the victim is danced to death by the mound folk (see also KMP 1.01, 1.42 and 1.60; AMJ 2.15). Satan also dances people to death, and so an intertextual relationship is established between the mound folk and Satan. The dancing occurs during normal farming activity and the girl has done nothing to bring this upon herself. In other variants, the hired hand seeks out the mound dwellers on his or her own accord. The death of the hired girl clearly threatens to disrupt the functioning of the farm, and has  implications for the physical well-being of the farm workers, the fecundity of the community in the future, and the economic survival of the farm. Jakob J&#xF8;rgensen (DS I 717) and K. P. Dalin (DS II A 91) tell remarkably similar variants of this story.

    In the published version of the story, Tang Kristensen added the remark "and stayed dead," to the end of the story.</annotation>

And for proof that there was something there, they were out haying in Alken one afternoon near the mound and one of the hired girls didn't want to go home, she felt so heavy, and so the others went and let her lie there.

    <english_publication>They came down through M&#xE5;nnes hollow and saw that Dakbj&#xE6;rg was raised up on four glowing poles, and the mound folk were swinging about in there to music played all-out, and a little man wearing a big red cap sat and looked on from the top of the mound. There&#x2019;s no doubt that there was something out there because once they were out haying in Alken at around lunch time, and that was nearby the mound. They were going to go home and eat their lunch but one of the girls didn&#x2019;t want to go along, she said that she felt really heavy, and so the others went and let her be. When they came back, she was frothing at the mouth and those devils had danced her to death. She was dead and stayed dead.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The motif of the men who will not stop arguing even after death is an amusing refiguration of the motif of the lovers whose love continues into the afterlife. In those stories, trees or rose bushes grow out of the graves and intertwine. In this case, as in AT 836D tales, "Fighting after Death", two contentious men continue to fight even after their death. 

      Carrying the small box of the fighting fists around the church during the  New Years' celebration is strange. Although the fighting fists might offer a strong corrective to members of the parish who were involved in petty squabbles--and thus help to unite the community at the start of the new year--the display is carnivalesque in nature and unfitting for the solemn atmosphere of the church. The church seems an unlikely place to parade a phenomenon that is clearly linked to haunting and, by extension, Satan. Interestingly, Tang Kristensen deletes the reference to this taking place in the church in the published version of the story. </annotation>

    <annotation>Peter returns to the frightening threat of the mound folk who attack the young shepherd girl (see KMP 1.60 and 2.13; AMJ 2.15). In many stories, the kidnapped girl never returns (DS I 860, 869). In contrast to those variants and his earlier story of a "dance" with the devil (troldt&#xF8;j) where the girl dies (see 2.11 above), here the girl survives (see also DS I 832). 

     The man's quick intervention averts the likely calamity of the loss of the girl. The use of religious symbols--both iconographic such as the inscription of the cross in the landscape and the oral, such as prayer--have a great deal of power over these threats to the human community. 

     The young girl is an interesting victim for a number of reasons. First, given her youth and gender, she represents both childhood innocence, and the future of the community. A threat to her is a threat to the community's children now and, because she will presumably become a mother later, future generations of children. Second, because she is working as a shepherd, she is contributing in an integral way to the economy of the farm. A threat to her is a threat to the farm's productivity.</annotation>

    <annotation>The lindorm presented here is unusual, partly because of where it is found, and partly because of its ability to eat man, horse and plow. In most stories of lindorm, the serpent threatens to topple a church (DS II E 22), or simply prevents people from attending church (see KMP 2.09). The threat the lindorm poses in those stories is clearly directed at the institution of the Lutheran church and, in the period prior to the constitutional reforms of 1849, the power and the authority of the Crown. 

     In Peder's story, the lindorm's threat is mainly economic. The lindorm is buried out on a field, and the man, his horse and plow all represent, in encapsulated form, the agricultural basis of the economy. Peder undermines the power of the story with his amusing mention that "things were smaller back then." 

     Stone walls, such as the one where the lindorm was buried, became a common feature of the Danish landscape after the land reforms of 1780. Walls separating fields were essential to maintain order in the crops, and to keep animals from tramping or overgrazing the fields.</annotation>

    <annotation>Peder situates historical events within the immediate landscape in this story. In this manner, he signals the importance of the Moss&#xF8; area to the growing sense of Danish nationalism and, through his narrative, vicariously takes part in one of the few successful battles the Danes waged against Prussia.

     In 1888, battles with Prussians were still fresh in the minds of many Danes, and in particular Jutlanders, given the crushing defeat that Denmark suffered at the hands of Bismark's army in 1864, including the slaughter at Dybb&#xF8;l (April 18, 1864), and the subsequent loss of Schleswig and Holstein. The political turmoil caused by the ongoing discussion of the Schleswig and Holstein question reverberated for decades in the newly forming Danish state. 

     Niels Ebbesen, a hero from the fourteenth century, and the Danish "victory" at Isted over the German-backed Schlewsig-Holstein army on July 25, 1850, became narrative touchstones for many Danes who were rightfully worried about the looming threat of Bismarck's Germany to the south. Peder makes the connection between Niels Ebbesen and 1849 explicit in his story, since in 1849 there were over two hundred German soldiers housed at Leg&#xE5;rdslyst, a farm to the west of Vrold, and quite close to Fuldbro M&#xF8;lle. The skirmish at Fuldbro M&#xF8;lle, on the bridge that ran directly in front of where Peder lived, was with German soldiers quartered at Leg&#xE5;rdslyst.

     Niels Ebbesen is one of the best known Danish freedom fighters. He fought against Count Gerhad from Holstein in Randers in April 1340, and died in the fort at Skanderborg on the first of November of that same year. Among the earliest descriptions of Niels Ebbesen's deeds in this battle are those in the nearly contemporaneous Jyske Kr&#xF8;nike (1342) and the slightly later Sj&#xE6;llandske Kr&#xF8;nike (1367). Along with various legends, Niels Ebbesen also appears in ballads (see DgF 156). Later references to Niels Ebbesen include a play by Kaj Munk (1944). A frigate in the post-WWII Danish navy is also named after him. Perhaps the only better known Danish hero is Holger Danske (JPP 4.32).</annotation>

    <annotation>The headless horse rather than the headless rider is a dominant motif in Danish tradition (see KMP 1.14 and 2.14; DS V 215). The horseman's sudden appearance disrupts Peder's father and uncle's nocturnal hunt and so spooks the dog that they have to call off their hunt. 

      Hunting privileges were usually reserved for the aristocracy and the Crown. Peasants tried to circumvent these laws, but forest rangers were employed by most landowners to prevent poaching. It is not too surprising that the two men encounter a frightening supernatural being while breaking the law late at night out in the woods.</annotation>

    <annotation>Illness was a constant threat in rural Denmark. Because of poor nutrition and poor hygiene, influenza and other epidemic illnesses could have catastrophic effects on the population.  The use of Christian symbols, such as the appeal to god expressed in "God bless you," to protect against an invisible, yet powerful, threat aligns well with other practices that people used to stave off threat. 

     Here, Peder suggests that a past practice has continued into the current day, even though the sneezing plague has passed. Indeed, personal experience would likely make one question the need for saying "God bless you" after a sneeze. Other explanations for the practice of saying this suggest that the soul leaves the body momentarily during a sneeze.

     There are many stories about plagues and the Black Death recorded in Denmark and Scandinavia (Tangherlini 1988; Lindow 1973/1974; see DS IV 1678, 1680-1684, 1687, 1690, 1695-1696, 1702, 1705, 1711).  The tradition dominant for plague in Denmark is some sort of celestial phenomenon, usually a fog or mist (Tangherlini 1988).</annotation>

    <annotation>The illness that kills off the cows appears to be directly related to the growth of an algae in the local lake. A toxic blue green algae (as Peder describes) can form on lakes during hot, still weather. If cows ingest the algae with their drinking water, they can suffer massive liver damage, and die within the hour (Bovine Blue-Green Algae Toxicosis).

     Animal epidemics and other sudden animal deaths were a devastating phenomenon in rural Jutland, and could ravage the economy of an entire community. These epidemics became a particular threat when farms moved away from a grains based agriculture to one emphasizing animal husbandry, dairy herds in particular.

     Working at the mill, Peder was in a perfect position to hear from all of the farmers the problems that they were having on their farms, including problems with their herds.</annotation>

    <annotation>Peder turns his attention to the wandering poor who had been a  common part of the Danish landscape up through the early parts of the nineteenth century. There was a pervasive sentiment that these people could not be trusted and were dangerous. Such sentiment influenced legislation concerning the treatment of the poor up through the end of the century (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940). At the same time, the incidence of alcoholism and its attendant problems, including violence, were quite high in this group (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940).

     Farms acting as informal inns were common. Many farmers earned extra money by selling their own distilled spirits. These private stills were illegal, and inspectors would occasionally confiscate the equipment and levy fines (see KMP 3.12). Offering lodgings and shelter to wanderers was a bit unusual, and obviously somewhat risky, but apparently an economically worthwhile business as well.

     Peder's mother was born in 1828, and so this fight presumably took place in the 1830s.</annotation>

    <annotation>In this story, Peder emphasizes the violent nature of the wandering poor. In many stories about the poor, there seems to be an underlying sense that these people are "different": they speak differently, they act differently, they wear unusual clothes. This "difference" comes to the fore in other stories about night men (natm&#xE6;nd), knackers (rakkere), and other vagabonds, in which the difference is also based on ascribed ethnicity. Even though most natm&#xE6;nd and rakkere were ethnically Danish, they were often lumped in with ethnic outsiders such as Jews, gypsies (tatere) and Poles.

     The wanderer's violent outburst at the kitten--and the death of the kitten--is out of line with the actual offense. While the death of the kitten does not impact the economy of the farm in a meaningful way (perhaps there will be a few more mice running about), the extraordinary violence of the outburst does pose a threat. Indeed, if he could kill a cute, furry little kitty cat, imagine what he could do to a child. The outburst links the wanderer to other outsiders, including supernatural outsiders such as the nisse, whose reactions also tend to be disproportionate. The reference to his size--"almost like a giant"--and his strange speech solidify this link.</annotation>

    <annotation>There are numerous variants of this story attested throughout Scandinavia (DS I 1122, 1124, 1128). Birthing was a dangerous proposition, and the incidence of death in childbirth was high. There are multiple explanations for the nisse's request for help. It is likely that the nisse hopes that the child can become Christian through the intervention of the human midwife, and the subsequent payment that results in the gift to Dover church. It is equally possible that the nisse's wife is a human, kidnapped into the other world. Accordingly, the wife would need a human to help her deliver.

     Peder's story of midwife to the nisse is unusual in that he casts the nisse in the role of supernatural protagonist rather than a mound dweller. Nisser are generally solitary figures and there are few stories in which they have families. John Lindow's analysis of the nisse would preclude a nisse family (Lindow 1975), since his analysis show nisse to be decidedly male and non-fertile.

    The reward offered the woman for her services and her reaction are typical. Things from the other world--food, money, animals--are often not what they appear to be. Here, of course, they are much more valuable than they seem. The stories can be seen as addressing the complexities of low level out group transactions, where the value of goods and services exchanged is hard to calculate (Tangherlini 1998).

    Many variants of this story resolve negatively when the woman discovers that she has thrown away considerable wealth since the one or two shavings remaining in her apron have transformed into gold (DS I 1137). Peder's secondary ending allows for a more positive resolution.

     Peder also adds a short, secondary story, also widely attested, and also usually related to the mound dwellers. Peder's tale emphasizes the symbiotic nature of the relationship between the farmer and the nisse.</annotation>

Then that night as she lay in her bed, she thought that the nisse came and said, "Well, you refused my gifts yesterday, even though they were better than they looked, but as soon as you get up you should go and look by the mouth of the spotted ox and you'll find something there that won't disappear as easily. I want you to have one part of it and the other part I'd like you to give to the church for my child.

    <annotation>The border between vagabonds and thieves was a fluid one, at least in the narrative tradition (PJ 1.01). The two thieves start off as Danish Robin-Hoods but quickly degenerate in the narrative into thugs. The thieves encapsulate many of the worries that people had about the large number of poor who wandered the countryside, particularly at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries. These worries undoubtedly influenced the fairly rapid move in the 1860s toward the establishment of poor farms in many Jutlandic districts (J&#xF8;rgensen 1940). 

      The hunt for the two thieves is helped along by the intervention of a miller. In this manner, Peder injects himself--or at least his representative--into the narrative. The song that is written about Kyvling-S&#xF8;ren is also clearly of interest to Peder given his work as a fiddler. Peder is similarly fascinated by the escape tool that the thief hides in his bowels. 

     The stocks house (stokhus), named for the whipping stocks on its premises, where Kyvling-S&#xF8;ren is incarcerated was one of Denmark's most notorious prisons. Originally a military prison, it was opened to civilian prisoners in 1741. The prisoners were broken into two groups: "honest" prisoners and "dishonest" prisoners, this latter group being those who had been whipped. Whipping was seen not only as a harsh punishment but also as a loss of honor. The prison was closed in 1860.

     The narrative hovers between fascination with these outlaws, and the celebration of their harsh punishment.</annotation>

They were in the habit of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. But they were rough, they chopped the breasts off of women and stabbed children to death with their knives. But then it got to be a bit too much, and the peasants got together and hunted them down at their own risk and cost. They shot Jens Knop but they couldn't find Kyvling-S&#xF8;ren. They had chased him over Ry bridge, but then he jumped into the river and they hadn't seen him since. They didn't believe he'd drowned since he was a good swimmer, and so now they'd simply lost trace of him. So now they went along the riverside to make sure that he didn't slip up into the woods again. As they lay there along the edge of the lake and talked about him, one of the millers comes over to them. Now as they're lying there looking out over the lake, he says, "That tuft of grass wasn't there last night." So one of the men grabs his rifle and shoots at the tuft and he hits him in the thick part of the arm. He had his hand up and was holding this tuft of grass up over his head. They got hold of him and he was sent to the stockade over in Copenhagen. He was supposed to start off by getting 27 lashes, him and one other guy. The other one was first, but he didn't handle it well at all. Then S&#xF8;ren says, "If you give in after so little, then you've got to be kind of soft." It was S&#xF8;ren's turn next. He was tied to the stocks, so that his knees were bound to it first and then his hands were bound to them, then his back was stretched and he got whipped with nine separate whips that had been soaked in brine, and he got three lashes with each one. The last three whips the Master could run his fingers down and the blood came pissing out of them. But they didn't hear a word from him. Then he was there for twenty-seven years and then he got out and he was an old man. He couldn't do anything at that point, and he earned his keep by going around and singing and playing music for people. Among other things, he played a piece he called Kyvling-S&#xF8;ren's piece, which is still played today occasionally. The last time that they caught him, they held him. But he'd been arrested a lot before and sat in jail but they never could keep him more than a night and that was because he had a contraption, shaped like a dagger, and it could be used as a saw on its one side, and a file on the other and he had it in a holster and he hid it in his anus. With it he could saw the thickest iron bars like when we cut wood. The last time they took it from him.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var et par kj&#xE6;ltringer, som huserede en gang oppe i Ry skov. De havde deres tilhold i savkulerne. Det var Kyvling-S&#xF6;ren og s&#xE5; en, de kaldte Jens Knop. De brugte ellers den trafik at stj&#xE6;le fra de rige og give til de fattige. Men h&#xE5;rde var de. De skar brysterne af kvinderne og stak b&#xF6;rnene ihjel med deres knive. S&#xE5; blev det for galt med dem, og b&#xF8;nderne slog dem sammen og jagede dem for egen regning og risiko. Jens Knop ham sk&#xF8;d de, men Kyvling-S&#xF6;ren kunde de ikke opdage, hvor var. De havde jaget ham over Ry bro, men da var han sprunget i &#xE5;en, og siden havde de ikke set ham. De havde dog ikke tro til, at han var druknet, for han var s&#xE5; meget en karl til at sv&#xF8;mme, og nu havde de alts&#xE5; helt og bar tabt sporet af ham. Men s&#xE5; blev de ved at f&#xF8;lge &#xE5;en ned imellem skoven og s&#xF8;en for at passe p&#xE5;, at han skulde ikke smutte op i skoven igjen, og de blev ved langs stranden. Som de nu l&#xE5; der i kanten af s&#xF8;en og l&#xE5; og snakkede om ham, s&#xE5; kommer der en af m&#xF6;llerfolkene hen til dem. Ved det de nu ligger og ser ud over s&#xF8;en, siger han: "Der er en gr&#xE6;stue, den var der ikke i aftes". Da tager en af m&#xE6;ndene sin b&#xF8;sse og skyder efter tuen. S&#xE5; rammer han ham i det tykke af armen, for han havde hans h&#xE5;nd oppe og holdt i tuen over hovedet med den. De fik ham nu fat, og han blev sendt over p&#xE5; stokhuset i Kj&#xF6;benhavn. S&#xE5; skulde han til begyndelse have 27 slag ris, ham og s&#xE5; en til. Den anden han fik f&#xF6;rst, men han gav sig meget ilde ved det. S&#xE5; siger S&#xF6;ren: "Giver du dig for s&#xE5; lidt, s&#xE5; m&#xE5; du v&#xE6;re lidt bl&#xF8;d af dig". Nu kom S&#xF6;rens tur n&#xE6;st efter. Han blev bunden til stokken s&#xE5;dan, at kn&#xE6;erne blev bundne til f&#xF6;rst, og s&#xE5; blev h&#xE6;nderne bundne dertil. Nu var ryggen strammet, og s&#xE5; fik han af 9 ris, der var lagt i saltlage, og han fik tre slag af hver. Men de sidste tre ris dem kunde mestermanden s&#xE5;dan tage og stryge fingrene ned ad, og da kom blodet pissende ud af dem. Men ikke et muk de h&#xF8;rte af ham. S&#xE5; var han der i stokhuset i 27 &#xE5;r, og s&#xE5; kom han ud som en gammel mand. Da kunde han ingen ting, og han fortjente hans f&#xF8;de ved at g&#xE5; om og synge og spille lidt for folk. Iblandt andet spilte han et stykke, som kaldes Kyvlings-S&#xF6;rens stykke og spilles undertiden endnu.
     Den sidste gang de tog ham, da holdt de ham. Men han havde tit v&#xE6;ret fanget f&#xF6;r og sat i arrest. De havde dog aldrig kunnet holde ham uden &#xE9;n nat, og det kom af, at han havde en indretning, lavet som en dolk, og den kunde save til den ene side og file til den anden. Den var i et hylster, og s&#xE5; havde han den gjemt i hans endetarm. Med den kunde han save de tykkeste j&#xE6;rnst&#xE6;nger over, som n&#xE5;r vi saver i tr&#xE6;. Men den sidste gang tog de den fra ham.</danish_publication>

    <annotation>The corpse lamb does not appear overtly as a portent for death. Rather, the lamb acts as a foundation sacrifice for the building of the church. Such sacrifices were intended to dispel the affects of harmful spirits or haunts. The most extreme form of such sacrifice occurs in stories about the plague. In some of those stories, children are buried at the boundary to the town or in churchyard walls to stop the disease (DS IV 1777). In other variants, the live burial is intended to help reestablish the community, and is not related to disease (DS IV 1787). The ghost of the sacrificed lamb subsequently haunts in the shape of the corpse lamb. Paradoxically, the people of the parish, in an attempt to guarantee the success of their church, unleash the innocent haunt of the lamb on the community.

     The foundation sacrifice is clearly not sufficient to guarantee the successful building of the church. Usually instructions for finding the building site come from a cunning person or a community member. In this case, they come clearly from outside the community. (See also KMP 1.18 and 3.10; and AMJ 3.05).

     In the published version, Tang Kristensen deleted the meta-performative reference to the story about the manor lord at Illerup, and the naming of the church, which are found in the manuscript (PJ 1.01).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There's a corpse lamb over at Dover church, it goes about on three legs. When the church was built, they were supposed to bury a living creature under the foundation. They were so poor that they couldn't get a hold of anything other than a lamb, at other places there was usually a sow, a horse or a cow. The old church was actually in Illerup, but it had become so dilapidated, that it couldn't stay up and then they were going to build a new one. They wanted to build in Svejstrup, it wasn't in one end of the parish like that, and the parsonage and school were there too. But everything they built wouldn't stay together and they couldn't get a church at that place. So they didn't know what to do. Then one day a traveler came by and while they stood there and hammered on the walls, he said, "What have you got here, little people, this looks like it's falling apart to me." - "Well, we want to build a church here, but we can't get it to stand; it falls down for us." - "Well," he says, "you shouldn't do it like this, you should get two oxen, which have never been in a harness before, and put a pulling harness on them, and then harness them to a pair of wheels, and let them go after the sun has set." Then the oxen wandered so far during the night that they came over to where Dover church now stands; there was a big alder swamp, and they went out into that and they couldn't get out. And so that's where the church was built. Then the story about the Manor Lord from Illerup came right after and that's how the church got it's name. The corpse lamb has been seen by a few people. Smede-Rask has seen it, and my grandfather, he believed that that is what it was.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>This amusing story comments indirectly on the level of hygiene on most Danish farms. The cure, told in the best fashion of the cunning folk, is simply a ruse.

     The appearance of a character in the story named Peder Johansen is surprising, but it is unlikely that Peder was referring to himself in the third person. It could well be that Tang Kristensen changed "mig" to P. Johansen while recording the story, although this seems unlikely. Regardless, Peder likely enjoys the vicarious narrative position of being the one who tricks Big Lavst into washing. Ironically, other stories tell of Peder's own slovenliness.</annotation>

    <annotation>One of the main complaints lodged against farm owners by their workers was the poor food and lodgings they received. Wages for farmhands and day laborers were very low, largely because of a glut of workers. Many contracts simply offered food, lodging, and a very small stipend paid quarterly or semi annually (Hvidt and Olsen 1990).

     The manor lady's churchgoing is unusual, taking place on a day and at a time not generally associated with churchgoing. Her solitary (rather than communal) use of the church mimics her selfishness and stinginess. It also leaves her wide open to apparent supernatural (Satanic) attack. The farmhand plays on this liminality in his successful attempt to trick her.

     Peder's story is reminiscent of the story of the would-be ghost (ML3005) (Stokker 1992). In those stories, however, the corrective is misguidedly aimed at the minister who turns out to be engaged in the necessary protection of the community from evil, and the farmhand is appropriately--if somewhat harshly--punished.

     Peder tells several stories of farmhands who trick their superiors for their own personal gain (PJ 1.02 and 2.27). Here, of course, the manor lady, much like the harsh manor lord at Urup (PJ 2.01), deserves to be punished for the mistreatment of her workers.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a woman who was quite stingy towards her workers. She lived near a church and had the church key. She had the habit of going into the church every Saturday evening to say all her prayers for the whole week. Now, she had gotten a new farmhand in November, and he wondered how he could teach her to give them better food. He had noticed her church-going and so he thought, "I'll trick her there." One Saturday evening he's in time to get into the church before her and he sits down behind the altar. The old woman comes in and falls down onto the kneeler, spreads her hands out and says: "Oh, how well one lives." "Yes, the devil feeds your body." Now she gets a little hot around the ears and thought that it was someone from the other world. "Why do you say that, dear sir?" "Because you give your workers so little to eat." "Oh, I'll improve myself." "Well then I'll be merciful." -- "But you see, I'm keeping all of that for my God." -- "Well, otherwise the little one [Satan] will tear out both your eyes." Then she hurried out of the church as fast as reins and bridle could hold, she'd had enough of that churchgoing. Since that time, she went to church along with other people, and her workers received fare like at the other farms.</english_manuscript>

The old woman comes in and falls down onto the kneeler, spreads her hands out and says: &#x201C;Oh, how well one lives.&#x201D;  &#x201C;Yes, the devil feeds your body.&#x201D; Now she gets a little hot around the ears, since she thought that it was someone from the other world. &#x201C;Why do you say that, dear sir?&#x201D; &#x201C;Because you give your workers so little to eat.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, I'll improve myself.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well then I'll be merciful.&#x201D; -- &#x201C;But you see, I'm keeping all of that for my God.&#x201D; -- &#x201C;Well, otherwise the little one [Satan] will tear out both your eyes.&#x201D; Then she hurried out of the church as fast as reins and bridle could hold. Since that time, she went to church along with other people, and her workers received fare like at the other farms.</english_publication>

    <annotation>One of Peder's most elaborate stories, this fictional tale focuses on a young man whose quick thinking and ability to keep his cool--character traits that Peder clearly valued--allow him to lead a more prosperous life. 

    The sale of goods on the way to market was forbidden, and the initial side agreement that Jens makes with the Hemstok men clearly falls outside of the law (Tangherlini 2012). This early transgression enables the rest of the story which relies entirely on the sale of goods that are not even remotely what they appear to be. 

    The overtly destructive nature of Jens's tricks resonates with Peder's first story, in which the farmhand kills the grandmother at the neighboring farm (PJ 1.01). The order of the ruses seems a bit confused since it does not progress in a manner of increasing harm. The men's deaths, by contrast, fittingly comes at the end of the story. The seeming disarray in the order of events is underscored by Peder's addition, after the end of the tale, of an episode in which Jens sells the men a fox to stay with their geese.  This addition is noted in expanded form in the fair copy of the tale.

    The Poles alluded to in the story were in Denmark during the war with Sweden, 1657-1659. The reference here to the Poles suggests that the story is understood to have taken place a long time ago--essentially "once upon a time."

    The story is indexed in the folk tale fair copy collection as &#xC6;v 1296 where it is given the title "Skj&#xE6;lmen og Narrene" [The Rogue and the Fools]. See also Registranterne til S. Grundtvigs samling af h&#xE5;ndskrevn danske folke&#xE6;ventyr, nr. 108 (Feilberg 3, 273). Although it appears in the table of contents of JFm XIII as story 37, it appears in the actual published collection as story 36, as the stories "Pisk i Asken," and "Guldkoen" are both numbered as story 27 in the published collection. It is a variant of ATU 1539, "Cleverness and Gullibility".</annotation>
    <danish_manuscript>Der ude paa Dover Hede laa et bitte Hus,

Boes, deraf har den sit Navn. Der kunde
de overse hele Landet og ingen kunde kom-
me til dem uden fra en Side, de andre
var omfl&#xF8;dt med Vand og det ligger s. h&#xF8;jt.
Men de skulde jo have noget at leve af og 
det gjorde Konen Regning paa. Men lad mig

Sted. Da de kom ud s. de. H&#xF8;r Jens, den
Hat har du egentlig ingen Brug for, du
kommer ikke ud som os og giver ikke mange
Lidkj&#xF8;b, den overlade os. Det vilde J. ikke

3783A
h&#xF8;re om. Endelig faar de ham overtalt til
at s&#xE6;lge Hat. for en 50 Rdl. og s. mente
J. endda h. havde givet dem den. Det tykte
de endelig ogsaa. Da J. fik Pengene str&#xF8;j

mere Forn&#xF8;jelse af den Hattekomedie. De
gaar hen og faar en M. med og til en V&#xE6;rt
kr&#xE6;ver dygtig ind. F&#xE6;rdig, tager 1 M. Hatten

Vi skal lige godt have ham af med de Penge
for vi kan nok magte ham begge to. Hen
paa anden Dags Aften tridser de om i He-
den til ham. J. sidder ud paa Vinduet.
Nu kommer de H. M. og de har ikke godt i Sin-
de, men a vil lige godt pr&#xF8;ve om a 
kan ikke narre dem nok en G. og s. gav
h. M. lidt Underretning om hvordan [de] hu skulde
forholde sig, naar de kom. M&#xE6;nd de kommer

3783B
ind og hilser godaft. Folk. b&#xF8;d den jo fra
D&#xF8;ren at sidde ned, de kommer jo til at sn.
med ham om den Handel og den var ikke s.
rele, men H. lod nej, de havde jo set paa
Varerne, og h. kunde ikke gj&#xF8;re for, te de
havde ikke det rigtige Haandelag. Som de
nu sidder og sn. frem og tilbage, da sidder
Kon. og sp. og nikker lidt ved Rok og til
sidst falder hu helt i S&#xF8;vn. Ja s. J. da
skal a lige godt se, om a kan ikke faa lidt
Arbejdslyst i dig. Tager en stor Kj&#xE6;p der
stod i Nabolaget ved ham og tr&#xE6;kker hende
jo en alvorlig en over Nak. det gl. Skind
og hu v&#xE6;lter af Stolen og bliver ligg. Ja
da er du og en farlig Kn&#xE6;gt, slaar du og
din egen Moder ihjel. Aa det har nok
ingen Fare s. J. og rumster lidt ved hende
Ja hun er sku vis over det. Men det er
der ingen Fare for og h. r&#xE6;kker op paa en
Hylder og tager en Fl&#xF8;jte der laa og den
s&#xE6;tter h. om i hendes Nakke og giver sig
til at bl&#xE6;se. Op spr. hu Kj lige paa en
Studs og s. Aa da dr&#xF8;mte a da godt.
og hu s&#xE6;tter sig da til at spinde som om
ingen Ting var forefaldt lige til det knase
de i Rokkev&#xE6;rket. Ja M&#xE6;ndene de kig
jo lidt paa dh. Ja ved du hvad J. naar

3784A
du vil give os den Fl&#xF8;jte, s. skal det hele
v&#xE6;re glemt med den Hattekom. for den
Fl&#xF8;jte kunde de bruge, deres Kvindfolk var
slem s&#xF8;vnige af dem. N. de fik jo Fl.
og de gik nok s. glad og vel forn&#xF8;jet hjem
S. s. den M. i den vester Gaard, Ja nu vil
a missel pr&#xF8;ve Fl. f&#xF8;rst, du pr&#xF8;vede H.
f&#xF8;rst og dg. er det da ingen Snyderi, for
Kj. hu var d&#xF8;d. Og h. sidder jo om 2 Dags
Aft. inde med hans Kvindfolk og venter jo
s. haardt paa at den ene af dem skulde
falde i S&#xF8;vn, at ha kunde kom til at 
pr&#xF8;ve dh. Indretn. Nu var det jo baade
saa og da, for det var nogle satans sikre
Kvindfolk, s. hvis de ikke fik det lidt godt
s. kunde M. risiker at faa det bag efter.
Skal der slaaes, s. skal der slaaes til, for
hellers gaar det ikke. S. omsider falder da
Kon. f&#xF8;rst i S&#xF8;vn og sov baade trygt og fast.
S. havde h. sat en tyk kj&#xE6;p i en Krog til
det Brug, den tr&#xE6;kker h. frem og s. giver h.
hende en lige ind i Planeten og hu v&#xE6;lter
jo om s. d&#xF8;d som en Sild. Men hvad gj&#xF8;r
du nu, slaar du nu din egen Kone ihjel da
er du et forvovent Mske. Aa det har
ingen Fare, a skal nok faa hende vaagen,
I skal ikke klage jer, og h. tager i Fl&#xF8;jten

3784B
og pib i Nak. paa hende, s. Vandet kom ud
af begge hans &#xD8;jne, men lige meget hjalp
det. S. s. h. til de andre: Nu maa I ende
lig tie stille med det, for den 2 skal mis-
sel pr&#xF8;ve det ogsaa, a vil ikke v&#xE6;re ene om
Skaden, og kort at fort. det gik 2 akku-
rat lige saadan. Nu fik de jo travlt
i nogle Dage med at faa deres Koner be
gravet og s. havde J. jo da Fred i den Tid.
I melder goddag var nogle Tatere dreven om
kring og havde haft Losi ved Jens og de
havde et udenlands Dyr med dem og det
havde de ladt blive med J. en Ulv og h.
vidste aldrig hvad h. skulde gj&#xF8;re ved det
Kreatur. S. omsider kommer M. ned til
ham en Dag og beg. at skylde ham for at
h. havde slaaet deres Koner ihjel og alt
deth. S. s. h. til dem. Ja a har jo ingen
Skyld i det, for I saa jo hvordan a bar
mig ad, og I har slaaet fejl. Men a har
faaet en V&#xE6;dder her, den vil a give jer for
at vi kan blive ved at holde Venskab
A tykker h. ser mig s. strag ud i Tovet,
s. den 1 Mand. Ja det er h ogsaa mente J.
men det er af en udenlandske Race og h. er
frisk og sund og hvor h. kommer i en Flok Faar
der kommer ingen Sygen imeld Faarene.

3785A
I de Tider havde de s. ondt ved at holde
Liv i deres Faar, for der var Sygen imeld
dem. Og s. er der endelig en Ting til og det
er det, at h er s. god til at passe paa Lam
me. R&#xE6;vene kan ingen Lam tage. S. tykte
de endelig ogsaa: Lad os tage ham, noget
er bedre end intet og V. fik de og tr&#xE6;kk. hjem
med ham. De havde deres Faarehold neden
for Gaardene og det var lagt til med Sne,
s. de drev alle Faarene ind i en Fold alle-
sammen, for de drev sam. altid. S. s. de
til deres Folk, nu skal I ikke se til dem
den f&#xF8;rste Dags Tid, h. skal have Tid til
at blive kjendt med dem, ellers vil h.
rende hen. N. Enden af Visen blev, at
Ulven bed en Del af Faarene ihjel og br&#xE6;k
Hul paa Taget og rendte sin Vej og de saa
ingen Ulv siden. S. gik det en lille Tid og 
de grubliserede over det Dyr der havde saa-
dan &#xF8;dt dem deres Faar og omsider kom
de i Tanker om, at det var ogsaa en Kj&#xE6;l-
tring streg h. havde spillet dem. Men nu 
var det blevet s. str&#xE6;ng Vinter, nu var der
ikke noget at spekul. paa med ham.
Men J. havde ikke lagt paa den dovne side
i det Lag, h. havde gaaet ned og kj&#xF8;bt sig et
udgangs&#xF8;g, og det havde h. faaet

3785B
stilt op. S. hen i Foraarstiden kom de ned
til ham en Dag og s. hvad er det for et B&#xE6;st
du har der lagt dig til Jens. Det er et 
B&#xE6;st der er stor Fortj. det ser ikke ud til ret
meget, men det er godt allig. S. havde h.
bundet en vendret Kurv for R&#xF8;ven af
det. Hvad skal det betyde den h&#xE6;nger
der. Aa s. h. det er for ikke at have for
meget Ulejlighed med at samle Pengene
op i Skidtet. Ja, s. skulde de jo hen at
se i den og der var en Hoben Gj&#xF8;dning, men
ogsaa nogle Kobberskj. Hvad, kan det B
gj&#xF8;re Penge. Ja det kan I da vel se. og 
s. med det samme slaar h et godt Slag
over R. af det og s. trimler der nogle fle
re ud fra Halen af det. Ja det ser ud
til det, s. de, saadan et kunde det nok
v&#xE6;re v&#xE6;rd at have. Ja s. J. det er der god
Fortj. ved, men ikke s. meget for mig,
for a har jo ikke Raad til at give det
s. god en F&#xF8;de. Jo flere Penge, jo bedre
F&#xF8;de det faar. Ja, Enden paa Visen blev
da at de fik J. til at overlade dem B&#xE6;stet
og s. tr&#xE6;k de jo hjem med det. Den ene af
dem fik det f&#xF8;rst og h. lod det gaa ind i
en af hans bedste Stuer og h. bar en hel
Del Havre ind til det og en hel Del S&#xE6;nge

3786A
kl&#xE6;der at det skulde ligge godt, for h. men
te jo at jo bedre den laa jo flere Penge den
fik. Men det viste sig, at den spolerede
dem alting og ingen Penge. Den 2 M. fik
det at pr&#xF8;ve ogsaa; ham gik det ligesaa
dan. S. s. de til hindanden: Nu skal h. 
l&#xE6;gges &#xF8;de, ellers l&#xE6;gger h. os &#xF8;de og s. fulg-
tes de ad derud og puttede ham i en S&#xE6;k
de havde med dem og det var en S&#xF8;ndag
Morg. S. tykte de nu da det var s. n&#xE6;r
ved Kirken, s. vilde de da ind og h&#xF8;re Pr&#xE6;k.
og s. lade ham ligge udenfor Kirk.grds-
muren i god Rolighed. S. s. h. albedst
som h. ligger, Nej a vill ikke til Himmels
for aldrig det. Der kommer en gl. M. i
det samme. Da vilde a s. m. gj&#xE6;rne, dersom
a kunde kom der. Ja da kan du nemt
komme der, dersom du vil krybe ind i dh.
S&#xE6;k s. h. Kn. S. maa vi to hellere kom 
til at bytte. H. l&#xF8;s for Kn. og kravler
i Pos. og Kn. binder rigtig godt for ham.
Da M. de havde h&#xF8;rt Tj. til Ende s. gaar
de ud og tager Posen igien og s. drager de
af Sted. Dh. gl. Gut h. spurgte dem ad
ivessomda: Er [de] vi der snart. Ja nu
skal det ikke vare l&#xE6;nge, inden du kommer der
og s. gav h. sig tilfreds. Da de kom ned

3786B
til Ravn S&#xF8;. s. smed de ham ud og s. gik
de hjem. Men undervejs kommer de forbi
J. der kommer drivende med et pr&#xE6;gtig Hob-
bel H&#xF8;veder, det var af M&#xE6;ndenes egne
der gik l&#xF8;se ude i Skoven og der gik han
og dr&#xF8;v med en Hjar af dem. Hvad
hvor er du kommen ved de H&#xF8;v. I dem
har a faaet paa Bunden af S&#xF8;en, der
er jo en dejlig Eng og der gik s. mange
Hark&#xF8;er og gik og gr&#xE6;ss. N. det gjorde der
s. de, s maa vi hellere gaa ned og faa os
en Hjar ogsaa, naar det gaar saadan til.
Men nu vil vi v&#xE6;re s. forsigtig at kun en 
af os gaar ad G. og naar den s. kommer der
ned s. skal den kalde. Det skete og saa
idet den f&#xF8;rste sprang ud s. sagde det Plom
og h. vidste ikke andet end [det] h sagde Kom
og s. [druk] sprang h bag efter og s. drukne-
de de begge to form&#xE6;lst deres Gjerrig
hed. Siden den Tid levede J. og hans M
i Rolighed og de begik dem som Folk den
om Stunder.
----
Endnu et Tr&#xE6;k. Faaet fat i en R&#xE6;v bilder
dem ind at det er en gasse og de tr&#xE6;kker
den op i deres gaasesti og den spolerede
dem alle g&#xE6;sserne og siden br&#xE6;kkede den
Hul paa Muren og l&#xF8;b, s fik den ikke n&#xE6;r-

    <english_manuscript>Out there on Dover heath there was a tiny little house, and no one lived there but an old woman and her son. Then one day when the woman had gone down to weave, she'd made a very nice piece of homespun and then she said to the boy, listen Jens, can't you take this piece of homespun and go to Aarhus with it, there's no use in going to Skanderborg, you won't be able to get rid of it there, and then you can sell it, but you're to get 1 mark for each two foot length. And please let me see that you can do this properly. I certainly will, he says, and he takes the cloth and went off. He went past Hemstok and the Hemstok men are standing outside there talking. Where are you going with that, you're going so fast. Yes, I'm going to Aarhus with this piece of cloth for my mother. Oh, are you now? How much does it cost...1 Mark. Well, then it's not worth your trouble going any farther, we'll take it, you don't have to go to Aarhus for that. The boy was quite happy about that and he gets his Mark and they get the homespun and then he went home to his mother with it. Oh, she said, when she heard how things had gone, that's how you handled yourself, little Jens. I doubted it. Then there's nothing else to do, since if I know those Hemstok men, they'll hold on to what they've got. Then a day later, she'd been out churning. Listen, here's some butter and some buttermilk, they better be in the churn together and you'd better put it on your back. But you aren't to go that way, you're to go over to the Poles, it was in the days when they were here and they had their stalls in a town named Boes, and that's how it got its name. They could see over the entire area, and nobody could come at them from one side, and the other sides were flooded with water, and it lay quite high. But they needed something to live off, and the woman counted on that. But let me see that they don't trick you, little Jens. No. This time they won't trick me any more than this here piece of straw, the boy said and then he bends over and was going to pick up a piece of straw, but isn't careful and the butter and milk spill over his head. Oh, it's a real shame, says the mother, with such a fathead. Yeah, yeah, said the boy, you're also so hot-headed. But give me a moment to think, I'll certainly trick them up there. Then Jens went and thought for several days and he made sure he got a piece of canvas she gave him one market day and he went to Skanderborg with it. He made sure that these Hemstok men were there and had seen him. Jens sells his canvas and gets a few coins in his pocket and then he goes in to three different inns and tells them a bit about how things stand, and how he wants to pay the two men back. Then he goes out again and finds these two men, and invites them in for a drink, and they thought, it isn't worth spending your money on us Jens. Well, I could certainly deal with you another time and he puffed himself up a bit. Sure, sure, said the first man, let's go. Waiter, give us a mug of Polak, that was a common drink in those days, it was half beer and half mead. The waiter brings it over immediately and when they were done, Jens took off his hat, it was an old lumpy one, and he puts it on his stock and gives it a spin and said, Hat, it's paid. Oh thank you, that's right, said the waiter. That's quite a hat, said the men, can you do it again. Sure, we can try, they went in to another place. Now I want to try said one of the men. Sure enough, it was right. The hat paid. Sure, said the second man, now you've tried it, now I want to try it too. To make a long story short, it went the same way the third place. When they came out, they said, Listen, Jens, you don't really need that hat, you don't get out like us and you don't make as many bargains, give it to us. Jens wouldn't hear tell of that. Finally, they convince him to sell the hat for 50 rixdollars, and even then Jens felt he'd given it to them. They thought so too. When Jens got the money, he headed quickly for home. They said, let's have a little more fun with this hat comedy. They go off and get another man to come with them and go to an inn and order a huge amount. When they're done, the first man takes the hat, gives it a good spin, Hat it is paid for. Wait a second, my good man, we don't accept hat tricks here. What, isn't it paid for. No. Out with your money, you have to pay. Then the other man says, it was the wrong side you spun it on, let me try. They go in to another inn. They got themselves a good beating there and then they could go home. They were quite disappointed and then the first man said, We can take the money back from him because the two of us can take him. About evening time the next day they cross over the heath to him. Jens is sitting in the window. Now the Hemstok men are coming and they don't have good ideas, but I'll try to see if I can't trick them again and then he told his mother a little bit about how she should act when they arrived. The men come in and greet them good evening. They invited them in and asked them to sit down. They had come to talk about the deal, they didn't think it had been so honest, but he said no, they had seen the goods, and he couldn't help it if they didn't have the right touch. As they're sitting there talking back and forth, the woman is sitting there spinning, and she's nodding off at the spinning wheel and finally she falls completely asleep. OK, says Jens, let me see if I can't put a little zeal into you. He grabs a big staff that was right near him and smacks her really hard on the back of her head, the poor old thing, and she falls off the chair and remains lying there. Wow, you're a dangerous guy, you killed your own mother. Oh, there's no danger of that, says Jens, and he shakes her a bit. She's beyond that. No, there's no danger of that and he reaches up to a shelf and takes a whistle that's lying there and bends down to the back of her head and begins blowing. And the old woman jumps right up, oh, I was having such a nice dream and she sits down to spin as if nothing had happened and spins so that the spinning wheel crackles. Well, the men look a little at this. You know what, Jens, if you'll give us that whistle, then we'll forget the whole hat comedy thing, because they could use that whistle, their women were so tired of them. Well, they got the whistle and they went home quite happy. Then the man in the western farm says, I want to try the whistle first, you tried the hat first and this time there's no cheating because that old woman, she was dead. And the next evening he's sitting inside with his women and eagerly waits for one of them to fall asleep, so that he could try this thing. Well, it was now this and that, because these were some darn secure women, so if they didn't have it pretty good, he risked hearing about it later. If you're going to hit, then you really need to hit, otherwise it won't work. Then after a while, the wife fell asleep and she slept soundly. Then he'd put a really thick cudgel in a corner to use for that purpose, he pulls it out and he smacks her one right in the face and she falls over as dead as a herring. What are you doing, did you kill your own wife, you're quite a daring person. Oh, there's no danger, I'll wake her up again, don't complain, and he takes the whistle and blows it in the back of her head, so water came out of both his eyes, but it didn't help. Then he says to the others: you better keep quiet about this, because the other one has to try this, I don't want to be the only one to be hurt like this, and to make a long story short, the same thing happened to the other one. Now they were busy for several days getting their wives buried and so Jens had peace for a while. In the meantime, some gypsies had wandered by and had gotten lodgings at Jens's and they had some foreign animals with them, and they'd left a wolf with Jens and he had no idea what he should do with it. Then a little later the men come down to him one day and begin to blame him for having them kill their wives and all that. Then he says, I'm not at fault, because you saw what I did, and you hit wrong. But I've gotten a ram here and I'll give it to you so we can stay friends. He looks like he's pulling a bit at the ropes, said the first man. Yes, he is, said Jens, but he's a foreign race and he is healthy and energetic and when he is put out in a flock of sheep, there'll be no illness among the sheep. In those days, they had a really hard time keeping their sheep alive, because they always got sick. And there's one more thing--he's really good at taking care of the lambs. The foxes won't get a single lamb. Then they thought: OK, let's have him, something is better than nothing and they got the ram and they led him home. They had their sheep down below the farms and it was covered with snow, so they drove all their sheep into a fold, since they always drove their animals together. Then they said to their people, don't check on them for a few days, he needs time to get to know them, otherwise he'll run away. Well, the end of the ballad was that the wolf bit a bunch of sheep to death and broke a hole in the roof and ran away and they didn't see the wolf again. Then a little time passed and the men went about wondering about the animal that had eaten their sheep and finally it occurred to them that he'd played a trick on them. But now the winter had gotten so harsh, there was nothing they could do to him. But Jens hadn't gotten lazy, he went down and bought himself an old nag, and he'd set it up there. Then toward spring time, they came down to him one day and they asked him, what kind of beast is that you've gotten yourself Jens. That's an animal that really helps out a lot, it doesn't look like much, but it's good anyway. He'd tied an upside down basket onto its ass. What's that supposed to mean, it hanging there like that. Oh, then I don't have to have the bother of picking up the money out of the shit. Well, then they wanted to go have a look, and there was a bunch of fertilizer, but also some copper coins. What, can that animal give money. Sure, you can see that yourself and at the same time he smacks the animal's ass and some more trickle out from its tail. Well, it sure looks that way, it would certainly be worth it having one like that. Yes, said Jens, it's a good investment, but not for me since I can't afford to give it good food. The better the food, the more money. Yes, the end of the ballad was that they got Jens to give them the animal and then they led it home. One of them got it first and he let it go about in one of his best rooms and he carried a bunch of oats in to it, and a bunch of bed clothes so that it would be comfortable, since he figured the better it lay the more money he'd get. But it turned out it ruined everything and no money. The other man got it to try too; it went the same way for him. Then they said to each other: Now we're going to destroy him, otherwise he'll destroy us and they went out there together and they put him in a sack they'd brought with them and it was a Sunday morning. Then they thought that they were so close to the church, they'd go in and listen to the sermon and so they left him lying quietly outside the church wall. Then he says, as he's lying there, no I don't ever want to go to heaven. An old man is walking by at that moment. I certainly do, said the man, if I could get there. You can get there easily, if you'll climb into this sack, said the boy. Well, then the two of us better switch. He opened up for the boy and climbs into the bag and the boy ties it up good and tight for him. When the men had listened to the end of the sermon, then they go out and pick up the bag again and then they head off. This old guy asked them, will we get there soon. Yes, it won't be long now, before you get there and he was happy with that. When they got down to Ravn lake, they threw him out there and then they went home. But along the way they meet Jens whose coming driving a big herd of cows, they were the men's own, they wandered about loose in the forest and he went there driving a herd of them. Hey, where did you find those cows. I found them at the bottom of the lake, there's a wonderful pasture, and there were so many cows grazing there. Oh really, they said, we'd better go down and get us a herd as well, when it's like that. But now we'll be careful and only one of us will go at a time, and when he gets down then he'll call up. That's what happened, and when the first one jumped out, it said Plom and he thought he said, Come, and then he jumped in after him and then they both drowned because of their greed. Since then, Jens and his mother lived peacefully and they acted like people did back then. One more thing. Gets hold of a fox and convinces them that it's a gander and they lead it up to their goose pen and it killed all the geese and then it broke a hole in the wall and ran off, and they never saw it again.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der ude paa Dover Hede laa et lille Hus, og i det boede ikke andre end en gammel Kone og hendes S&#xF8;n. En Dag, som Konen var ved at v&#xE6;ve, blev hun lige f&#xE6;rdig med et kj&#xF8;nt Stykke Vadmel, og saa siger hun til Kn&#xE6;gten: "H&#xF8;r, Jens, nu kan du tage det Stykke Vadmel og gaa til Aarhus med og s&#xE6;lge for mig. Det kan ikke hj&#xE6;lpe, du gaar til Skanderborg, for der kan du ikke blive af med det, og du skal have en Mark for Alen. Men lad mig nu se, du b&#xE6;rer dig lidt ordentlig ad." &#x2014; "Ja, det skal a nok," siger han, og han tager T&#xF8;jet og gaar med. Saa gaar han nu om ad Hemstok. Der staar de Hemstok M&#xE6;nd uden for og Snakker. "Hvor skal du hen med det T&#xF8;j?" siger de, "du farer saa st&#xE6;rkt." &#x2014; "Ja, a skal til Aarhus med det for min Moder." &#x2014; "Naa, det skal du, hvad skal det da koste?" &#x2014; "Det skal koste en Mark." &#x2014; "Ja, saa er det da ikke v&#xE6;rd, du gaar l&#xE6;ngere for den Sags Skyld, saa vil vi tage det." Det var Kn&#xE6;gten saa meget glad til, og han faar hans Mark, og de faar Vadmelet. Saa gik han hjem til hans Moder med det. Da hun fik at h&#xF8;re, hvordan han havde baaret sig ad, siger hun: "Ja, a tvivlte nok paa, det vilde gaa dig galt, bitte Jens. Der er ikke mere ved det at gj&#xF8;re, for kjender a de Hemstok M&#xE6;nd rigtig, saa holder de nok ved det, de faar fat i." Det sagde Jens ikke noget til.
En Dags Tid efter var hun ved at kj&#xE6;rne, og da hun havde faaet Sm&#xF8;r, siger hun til Drengen: "Her har du nu dether Sm&#xF8;r og dether Kj&#xE6;rnem&#xE6;lk, det maa helst blive sammen i Kj&#xE6;rnen med hinandt, og saa skal du tage det paa din Ryg og gaa over til Polakkerne med det." Det var i den Tid, de huserede her i Jylland, og de havde deres Baase i den By, der hedder Boes, deraf fik den sit Navn. Derfra kunde de overse hele Landet, for det ligger saa h&#xF8;jt, og tilligemed kunde ingen komme til dem uden fra &#xE9;n Side, alle de andre var omfl&#xF8;dt med Vand. Nu gjorde Konen jo Regning paa at kunne afs&#xE6;tte nogle F&#xF8;devarer til dem, for noget skulde de jo altid have at leve af. "Lad mig nu endelig se, bitte Jens, te de narrer dig ikke." &#x2014; "Nej," siger han, "den Gang skal de mins&#xE6;l ikke komme til at narre mig mere end dether Halmstraa," siger han Kn&#xE6;gten, og saa bukker han sig ned og vil tage ved Halmstraaet, men tager sig ikke i Vare for, at Kj&#xE6;rnem&#xE6;lken og Sm&#xF8;rret gik ud over Hovedet paa ham. "Nej, det er dog bedr&#xF8;veligt med saadan et Knudhoved," siger Moderen. "Jaja, I er ogsaa saa hiddsig," siger han Kn&#xE6;gten, "men lad mig nu faa Tid til at bet&#xE6;nke mig, saa skal a missel nok faa dem pudset der oppe."
     Dermed gik Jens, og saa spekulerede han paa det i nogle Dage. Han s&#xF8;rgede jo for at faa et Stykke L&#xE6;rred af hans Moder, for der skulde v&#xE6;re Marked i Skanderborg, og saa foregav han jo, at han vilde derned og s&#xE6;lge det. Han rejser ogsaa af og faar hans L&#xE6;rred solgt, saa han faar lidt M&#xF8;nt paa Lommen. I det samme faar han at se, at de Hemstok M&#xE6;nd var ogsaa der nede. Saa gaar han ind til tre V&#xE6;rter og S&#xE6;tter dem til Hobe lidt ind i Sagerne, angaaende hvordan han vilde betale de M&#xE6;nd for deres Snyderi imod ham, og saa giver han hver af dem saa mange Skillinger, som en Omgang kunde koste. Naa, saa gaar han ud igjen og leder de to M&#xE6;nd op. Han byder dem altsaa ind paa en Gjenstand. "Aa," siger de, "vi tykkes ikke, det er v&#xE6;rd, du spenderer noget paa os, Jens." Ja&#x2014;a, han brystede sig jo noget, "a kan vel komme til at handle med jer en anden Gang." &#x2014; "Jaja," siger saa den ene Mand, "lad os saa gaa ind med dig." &#x2014; "Hej, V&#xE6;rt, lad os faa et Krus Polak!" &#x2014; det var en Drik, der var meget almindelig den Gang og bestod halvt af Br&#xE6;ndevin og halvt af Mj&#xF8;d. V&#xE6;rten kom strags springende med det, og den Gang de var f&#xE6;rdige, tog Jens hans Hat af, det var saadan en gammel buleret &#xE9;n, og s&#xE6;tter paa hans Kj&#xE6;p og giver den et Snur og Siger: "Hat, det er jo betalt." &#x2014; "A takker," siger V&#xE6;rten, "det passer." &#x2014; "Det var en grumme Hat," siger de Hemstok M&#xE6;nd, "kan den gj&#xF8;re det &#xE9;n Gang til?" &#x2014; "Ja, vi kan jo pr&#xF8;ve ad." De gik saa ind et andet Sted. "Ja, nu vil a missel pr&#xF8;ve den," siger den ene af M&#xE6;ndene, og Jens kr&#xE6;ver ind, og Manden snurrede med den. Jo, det paste godt nok. Hatten den betalte. "Ja," siger den anden Mand, "nu har du pr&#xF8;vet den, da vil a ogsaa se at give den et Snur." Det gik kort at fort&#xE6;lle lige saadan det tredje Sted. Jens sagde: "Hat, du har jo betalt", og V&#xE6;rten kom Springende og sagde: "A takker, det passer." Da de kom ud, sagde M&#xE6;ndene: "H&#xF8;r, Jens, den Hat kan du overlade os, den har du egentlig ingen Brug for, da du ikke kommer videre ud, saadan som os, og giver ikke mange Lidkj&#xF8;b." Men det vilde Jens ikke h&#xF8;re om. Endelig faar de ham overtalt til at s&#xE6;lge Hatten for en 50 Rigsdaler, og saa mente Jens endda, han havde givet dem den. Det tykte de da endelig ogsaa selv. Da Jens fik Pengene, str&#xF8;g han af hjem.
     Saa sagde M&#xE6;ndene: "Vi vil have lidt mere Forn&#xF8;jelse af den Hattekomedie." De gaar hen og faar en Tredjemand med, og saa triner de ind til en V&#xE6;rt og kr&#xE6;ver dygtig ind. Da de er f&#xE6;rdige, tager den ene Mand Hatten og giver den et Sno, rette den spillede paa Kj&#xE6;ppen. "Hat, det er jo betalt," siger han, men V&#xE6;rten sagde noget andet. "Nej, holdt, god Karl, her gaar det ikke til med Hunderkunster." &#x2014; "Hvad, er det ikke betalt?" siger de. "Nej, I maa op med Pengene, hvem skulde have betalt for jer?" og de maatte altsaa punge ud. Saa siger den anden Mand, da de var kommen uden for: "Jamen det var ogsaa den fejle Side, du snoede til, lad mig nu pr&#xF8;ve den." Saa gaar de ind paa et andet V&#xE6;rtshus og spiser og drikker, og der reddede de dem en god Tragt Kl&#xF8;, saa kunde de gaa hjem med det. &#xC6;rgerlige var de, og det til Gavns.
     "Vi skal lige godt have ham af med de Penge igjen," siger den ene Mand, "for han har jo snydt os vel grovt, og vi kan nok magte ham begge to." Hen paa anden Dags Aften tridser de ud i Heden til ham. Jens kikker ud paa Vinderet og siger: "Nu kommer de Hemstok M&#xE6;nd, og de har ikke godt i Sinde, men a vil lige godt pr&#xF8;ve, om a kan ikke narre dem nok en Gang." Saa gav han Moderen lidt Underretning om, hvordan hun skulde forholde sig, naar de kom. M&#xE6;ndene de kommer ind og hilser Godaften. Folkene b&#xF8;d dem jo fra D&#xF8;ren at sidde ned, og de kommer saa til at snakke med ham om den Handel. De mente jo, den var ikke saa rele, som den kunde v&#xE6;re. Men Jens paastod, at de havde jo set paa Varerne, og han kunde ikke gj&#xF8;re for, te de havde ikke det riglige haandelag. Som de nu sidder og snakker frem og tilbage, da sidder Konen ved Rokken og spinder, og hun nikker lidt, og til sidst falder hun helt i S&#xF8;vn. "Naa, du har det saadan," siger Jens, "da skal a lige godt se, om a kan ikke faa lidt Arbejdslyst i dig," og dermed tog han en stor Kj&#xE6;p, der stod i Nabolaget ved ham, og tr&#xE6;kker hende jo en alvorlig &#xE9;n over Nakken, det gamle Skind, saa hun v&#xE6;lter ned af Stolen og bliver liggende. "Ja, da er du og en farlig Kn&#xE6;gt," siger M&#xE6;ndene, "slaar du din egen Moder ihjel." &#x2014; "Aa, det har nok ingen Fare," siger Jens og rundsler lidt ved hende. "Ja, hun er missel vist ovre det," siger de. "Nej, det er der ingen Fare for", og han r&#xE6;kker op paa en Hylde og tager en fl&#xF8;jte, der laa, og den s&#xE6;tter han om i hendes Nakke og giver sig til at bl&#xE6;se. Op springer hun Kj&#xE6;llingen lige paa en Studs og siger: "Aa, da dr&#xF8;mte a endda godt." Hun s&#xE6;tter sig da til at spinde, som om ingen Ting var forefaldt, og det, lige til det knasede i Rokkev&#xE6;rket. Ja, M&#xE6;ndene de keg jo lidt paa dether. "Ja, ved du hvad, Jens," siger de, "naar du vil give os den Fl&#xF8;jte, saa skal det hele v&#xE6;re glemt med den Hattekommers," for den Fl&#xF8;jte kunde de bruge, deres Kvindfolk var nemlig slemt s&#xF8;vnige af sig. Naa, de fik Fl&#xF8;jten, og de gik nok saa glade og vel forn&#xF8;jede hjem. Saa siger Manden i den vestre Gaard: "Ja, nu vil a missel pr&#xF8;ve Flojten f&#xF8;rst, du pr&#xF8;vede Hatten f&#xF8;rst. Denher Gang er det da intet Snyderi, for vi saa jo, Kj&#xE6;llingen hun var d&#xF8;d og blev levende igjen."
     Anden Dags Aften sidder han inde i Stuen ved hans kvindfolk og venter jo saa haardt paa, te den ene af dem skulde falde i S&#xF8;vn, for at han kunde komme til at pr&#xF8;ve denher Indretning. Nu var det jo baade saa og da, for det var nogle Fandens sikre Kvindfolk, han havde, og hvis de ikke fik et rigtig godt Tr&#xE6;k, saa kunde han risikere at faa det gjengj&#xE6;ldt bag efter. Det sad han nu og t&#xE6;nkte paa. "Skal der slaaes til, saa skal der slaaes til, for ellers gaar det ikke," t&#xE6;nkte han ved sig selv. Omsider falder da Konen i S&#xF8;vn f&#xF8;rst og sov baade trygt og fast. Nu havde han sat en tyk Kj&#xE6;p i en Krog til det samme Brug, og saa tr&#xE6;kker han den frem og giver hende &#xE9;n ind lige i Planeten, og hun v&#xE6;lter jo om saa d&#xF8;d som en Sild. "Men hvad gj&#xF8;r du nu!" siger de andre, og Springer op og hujer og skriger, "slaar du nu din egen Kone ihjel, da er du og et forvovent Menneske." &#x2014; "Aa, det har ingen Fare," siger han, "a skal nok faa hende vaagen, I skal ikke klage jer." Han tager i Fl&#xF8;jten og piber i Nakken paa hende, saa Vandet kom ud af begge hans &#xD8;jne, men lige meget hjalp det. Saa siger han til hans Folk: "Nu maa I endelig tie stille med det, for min Nabomand skal missel pr&#xF8;ve det ogsaa, a vil ikke v&#xE6;re ene om Skaden." Og kort at fort&#xE6;lle, det gik den anden akkurat lige saadan.
     Nu fik de jo travlt i nogle Dage med at faa deres Koner begravet, og saa havde Jens da Fred i den Tid. Imelder godlag var nogle Tattere dreven omkring og havde haft Logi ved Jens, og de havde et udenlands Tyr med dem, som de kaldte en Ulv. Saa havde de ladt den blive ved ham, og han vidste aldrig, hvad han skulde gj&#xF8;re ved det Kreatur. Omsider kommer M&#xE6;ndene ned til ham en Dag og begynder at Skylde ham for, at han havde slaaet deres Koner ihjel og alt dether. Dertil svarer han: "Ja, a har jo ingen Skyld i det, for I saa jo, hvordan a bar mig ad, og I maa jo have slaaet fejl. Men a har faaet en V&#xE6;dder her, den vil a give jer, for at vi kan blive ved at holde Venskab." &#x2014; "A tykkes, han ser mig saa strag ud i Tovet," siger den anden Mand. "Ja, det er han ogsaa," mente Jens, "men det er af en udenlandsk Race, og han er frisk og sund, og der er den store Fordel ved at have ham, te hvor han kommer i en Flok Faar, der kommer ingen Sygen imeld dem." I de Tider havde de nemlig saa ondt ved at holde Liv i deres Faar, for der var tit Sygen imeld dem, og mange d&#xF8;de hver Vinter. "Og saa er der endelig &#xE9;n Ting til", siger Jens, "og det er, at han er saa god til at passe paa Lammene, og naar I har ham, saa kan R&#xE6;ven ingen Lam tage." De tykte endelig ogsaa, at den var v&#xE6;rd at have. "Lad os tage ham, noget er bedre end intet," sagde de, og saa fik de denher V&#xE6;dder og tr&#xE6;kkede af hjem med ham.
     De havde deres Faarefold neden for Gaardene, og lige i Tiden var Markerne lagt til med Sne, saa de havde drevet alle deres Faar ind i en Fold, og begge M&#xE6;ndene drev altid sammen med deres Faar. Da de nu lader Ulven komme ind til dem, sagde de til deres Folk: "Nu skal I ikke se til dem den f&#xF8;rste Dags Tid, han skal have Tid til at blive kjendt med dem, ellers vil han vel rende hen, naar Faarene kommer ud igjen." Naa, Enden af Visen blev, at Ulven bed en Del af faarene ihjel og br&#xE6;kkede saa Hul paa Taget og rendte sin Vej, og de saa ingen V&#xE6;dder siden. Da Folkene kommer hen og skal have set til deres Faar, saa laa de der i en bedr&#xF8;velig Forfatning.
     Nu gik der en lille Tid, og M&#xE6;ndene gik og grubliserede over, hvad det var for et Dyr, der saadan havde &#xF8;dt dem deres Faar. Omsider kom de i Tanker om, at det var ogsaa en Kj&#xE6;ltringstreg, Jens havde spillet dem. Men nu var det blevet saa str&#xE6;ng en Vinter, te nu var der ikke noget at spekulere paa med ham for det f&#xF8;rste.
     Men Jens havde ikke ligget paa den dovne Side i det Lag. Han havde gaaet ned og kj&#xF8;bt sig et Udgangs&#xF8;g, og det havde han faaet indkvarteret hjemme i Huset. Saa hen i Foraarstiden kom M&#xE6;ndene ud til ham en Dag, og de faar strags dether &#xD8;g at se. "Hvad er det for et B&#xE6;st, du har der lagt dig til, Jens?" &#x2014; "Det B&#xE6;st er der stor Fortjeneste ved," siger han, "det ser ikke ud til ret meget, men det er godt alligevel." Nu havde han jo set, M&#xE6;ndene de kom, og saa havde han bundet en vendret Kurv for R&#xF8;ven af det. "Hvad skal det betyde, den Kurv h&#xE6;nger der?" siger de. "Aa," siger han, "det er for ikke at have for megen Ulejlighed med at samle pengene op i Skidtet." Ja, saa Skulde de jo hen at se i Kurven, og der var en Hoben Gj&#xF8;dning, men ogsaa nogle Kobberskillinger. "Hvad! kan det B&#xE6;st gj&#xF8;re Penge?" siger de. "Ja, det kan I da vel se," og saa med det samme skaar han et godt Slag over R&#xF8;ven af det. Da trimler der nogle Skillinger ud fra Halen. "Ja, det ser ud til det," siger de, "saadan et Dyr kunde det nok v&#xE6;re v&#xE6;rd at have." &#x2014; "Ja," siger Jens, "der er god Fortjeneste ved det Dyr, men ikke saa meget for mig, for a har jo ikke Raad til at give B&#xE6;stet saa god en F&#xF8;de, som det skulde have. Jo flere penge, jo bedre F&#xF8;de det faar." Ja, Enden paa Visen blev da, at de fik Jens til at overlade dem &#xD8;get, og saa tr&#xE6;kker de jo hjem med det. Manden i den vestre Gaard fik det f&#xF8;rst, og han lod det gaa ind i en af hans bedste Stuer, og han bar en hel Del Havre ind til det og en hel Del Sengkl&#xE6;der, at det Skulde ligge godt, for han mente jo, at jo bedre det laa, jo flere Penge det fik. Men det viste sig snart, at &#xD8;get spolerede dem alting og alligevel ingen penge gjorde. Den anden Mand fik det at pr&#xF8;ve ogsaa, og ham gik det lige saadan.
     Nu kan det nok v&#xE6;re, de var blevne vrede paa Jens, og de l&#xE6;gger over med hinanden: "Nu skal han l&#xE6;gges &#xF8;de, for ellers l&#xE6;gger han os &#xF8;de." Saa fulgtes de ad derned igjen, og de fik fat i ham og put ham i en S&#xE6;k, de havde med dem. Det var en S&#xF8;ndag Morgen, dether gik for sig. De rejser saa af med ham i S&#xE6;kken, og da deres Vej faldt lige forbi Kirken, saa vilde de da ind og h&#xF8;re Pr&#xE6;kenen. Saa kunde de lade ham ligge uden for Kirkegaardsmuren i god Rolighed ilav, og de smider S&#xE6;kken og gaar ind. Allerbedst som han nu ligger der, siger han saadan temmelig h&#xF8;jt: "Nej, a vil ikke til Himmels for aldrig det." Saa kommer der en gammel Mand forbi i det samme, og han h&#xF8;rer det. "Da vilde a saam&#xE6;nd gj&#xE6;rne til Himmerig, dersom a kunde komme der." &#x2014; "Ja, da kan du nemt komme der," siger Jens i S&#xE6;kken, "dersom du vil krybe ind i denher S&#xE6;k, saa maa vi to hellere komme til at bytte, for a skal netop til Himmerig." Han l&#xF8;ser for Kn&#xE6;gten, og Jens kryber ud, men den gamle Mand kravlede i den, og Kn&#xE6;gten binder rigtig godt for ham.
     Da M&#xE6;ndene de havde h&#xF8;rt Tjenesten til Ende, saa kommer de jo ud og tager Posen igjen, og saa drager de af Sted med den. Denher gamle Gut han spurgte dem ivessomda: "Er vi der snart?" &#x2014; "Ja, nu skal det ikke vare l&#xE6;nge, inden du kommer der," siger de, og saa gav han sig tilfreds. Da de kom ned til Ravn S&#xF8;, saa smed de ham ud, og saa gik de hjem. Men undervejs mellem S&#xF8;en og Boes kommer de forbi Jens, han kom drivende med et pr&#xE6;gtigt Kobbel H&#xF8;veder, det var nogle af M&#xE6;ndenes egne, der gik l&#xF8;se nede i Skoven, og der havde han givet sig til at gaa og drive med en hj&#xE6;r af dem. "Hvad, er du her? hvor er du kommen ved de H&#xF8;veder?" &#x2014; "Ja, dem har a faaet paa Bunden af S&#xF8;en. Der er jo en dejlige Eng, og der gik saa mange Havk&#xF8;er og gik og gr&#xE6;ssede." &#x2014; "Naa, det gjorde der," sagde de, "saa maa vi hellere gaa ned og faa os en Hj&#xE6;r ogsaa, naar det gaar saadan til at faa dem. Men nu vil vi v&#xE6;re saa forsigtige, at kun &#xE9;n af os gaar ad Gangen, og naar den saa kommer derned, og det forholder sig rigtigt, hvad Kn&#xE6;gten har opgivet, saa skal den kalde." Det skete nu ogsaa. Idet den f&#xF8;rste Sprang ud, saa sagde det: "Plom!" og den anden han vidste ikke andet, end han sagde: "Kom!" Saa sprang han bag efter. De druknede altsaa begge to formedelst deres Gjerrighed. Siden den Tid levede Jens og hans Moder i Rolighed, og de begik dem som Folk i deres Stilling nu om Stunder.

Fort&#xE6;lleren har ogsaa h&#xF8;rt historien fort&#xE6;lle med endnu et Tr&#xE6;k. Jens havde faaet fat i en R&#xE6;v og bilder dem saa ind, at det er en Gasse. Den tr&#xE6;kker de op i deres Gaasesti og lader den v&#xE6;re ved Gj&#xE6;ssene om Natten. Den spolerede dem allesammen, og siden br&#xE6;kkede den hul paa Muren og l&#xF8;b, saa de fik ikke mere ud af det.

    <english_publication>Out there on Dover heath lay a tiny little house, and no one lived there but an old woman and her son. One day as the woman was weaving, she finished up a very nice piece of homespun and so she says to the boy: &#x201C;Listen Jens, now you can take this piece of homespun and go to &#xC5;rhus with it and sell it for me. It won&#x2019;t help going to Skanderborg, because you won&#x2019;t be able to get rid of it there, and you&#x2019;re to get one mark for each two foot length. But please show me that you can do this properly.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;I certainly will,&#x201D; he says, and he takes the cloth and goes off. Now he goes past Hemstok. The Hemstok men are standing outside there talking. &#x201C;Where are you going with that cloth?&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;you&#x2019;re going so fast.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, I&#x2019;m bringing it to &#xC5;rhus for my mother.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh, are you now? How much does it cost?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;It costs one mark.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, then it&#x2019;s not worth your trouble going any farther for that, we&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201D; The boy was quite happy about that and he gets his mark and they get the homespun. Then he went home to his mother with the money. When she heard how he&#x2019;d handled himself, she said, &#x201C;Well, I certainly had my doubts that things would go well for you little Jens. There&#x2019;s nothing else to do, since if I know those Hemstok men, they&#x2019;ll hold on to what they&#x2019;ve got.&#x201D; Jens didn&#x2019;t say anything in reply.
One day later, she was out churning and when she had gotten butter, she says to the boy: &#x201C;Listen, here you&#x2019;ve got this butter and this buttermilk, it&#x2019;s best if they are in the churn together; put it on your back and go over to the Poles with it.&#x201D; It was in the days when the Poles were quartered here in Jutland and they had their stalls [b&#xE5;se] in a town named Boes, and that&#x2019;s how it got its name. They could watch over the entire area from there, because it sits fairly high, and by the same token nobody could come at them from one side, and all the other sides were flooded with water. Now the woman counted on being able to sell them some foodstuffs, because they would always need something to live off. &#x201C;Let me see that they don&#x2019;t trick you, little Jens.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;No,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;this time they sure as heck won&#x2019;t trick me any more than this here piece of straw,&#x201D; says the boy and then he bends over to pick up the piece of straw, but isn&#x2019;t careful and the butter and milk spill over his head. &#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s a real shame with such a churl,&#x201D; says the mother. &#x201C;Yeah, yeah, you&#x2019;re also so hot-headed,&#x201D; says the boy, &#x201C;but give me a moment to think, I&#x2019;ll certainly trick those guys up there in Hemstok.&#x201D;
     Then Jens went and thought about it for several days. He made sure to get a piece of canvas from his mother, because there was going to be a market in Skanderborg, and he told her that he wanted to go down there and sell it. He goes off and sells his canvas and gets a few coins in his pocket. At that moment, he sees that the Hemstock men are down there too. So he goes to three innkeepers and tells them a bit about how things stand, and how he wants to pay the two men back for their trickery and then he gives each of them enough shillings to pay for a round of drinks. Well, then he goes out again and finds these two men. He invites them in for a drink. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;we don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s worth it spending your money on us Jens.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well--,&#x201D; Jens puffed himself up a bit, &#x201C;I could certainly wind up making a deal with you another time.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Sure, sure,&#x201D; says one of the men, &#x201C;let&#x2019;s go in with you.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Hey, innkeeper, give us a pitcher of Polak!&#x201D;-- that was a common drink in those days, it was half beer and half mead. The innkeeper brings it over immediately and when they were done, Jens took off his hat, it was an old lumpy one, and he puts it on his staff and gives it a whirl and says, &#x201C;Hat, it&#x2019;s paid.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;I thank you,&#x201D; says the innkeeper, &#x201C;that&#x2019;s quite right.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;That&#x2019;s quite a hat,&#x201D; the Hemstok men say, &#x201C;can you do it again?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Sure, we can try.&#x201D; So they went to another place. &#x201C;Now I sure as heck want to try,&#x201D; says one of the men, and Jens orders, and the man spun it. Sure enough, it was right. The hat paid. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; says the other man, &#x201C;now that you&#x2019;ve tried it, I want to try it too.&#x201D; To make a long story short, it went the same way at the third place. Jens said, &#x201C;Hat, you&#x2019;ve paid,&#x201D; and the innkeeper came running and said, &#x201C;I thank you, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D; When they came out, the men said, &#x201C;Listen, Jens, you can give us that hat, you don&#x2019;t really need it, you don&#x2019;t get out like us and make as many deals.&#x201D; But Jens wouldn&#x2019;t hear talk of that. Finally, they convince him to sell them the hat for fifty rixdollars, and even then Jens felt he&#x2019;d given it to them. They thought so too, actually. When Jens got the money, he headed quickly for home. 
     Then the men said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s have a little more fun with this hat comedy.&#x201D; They go off and get another man to come with them and go to an inn and order a huge amount. When they&#x2019;re done, the first man takes the hat, gives it a good spin, so that it almost fell off the staff. &#x201C;Hat, it is paid for,&#x201D; he says, but the innkeeper said something else. &#x201C;Wait a second, my good man, we don&#x2019;t accept monkey tricks here.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;What, isn&#x2019;t it paid for?&#x201D; they say. &#x201C;No, you better come with your money, who was supposed to have paid for you?&#x201D; and they had to pay. Then the other man says, when they&#x2019;d gotten outside, &#x201C;It was the wrong side you spun it on, let me try.&#x201D; They go in to another inn and they eat and drink, and they got themselves a good beating there and then they could go home. They were quite disappointed.
     &#x201C;We can take the money back from him,&#x201D; says the first man, &#x201C;because he has tricked us quite badly, and the two of us can take him.&#x201D; About evening time the next day they cross over the heath to him. Jens looks out the window and says, &#x201C;Now the Hemstok men are coming and they don&#x2019;t have good thoughts, but I&#x2019;ll try to see if I can&#x2019;t trick them again.&#x201D; Then he told his mother a little bit about how she should act when they arrived. The men come in and wish them a good evening. They invited them in and asked them to sit down and they had come to talk with him about the deal. They didn&#x2019;t think it had been as honest as it could have been. But Jens claimed that they had seen the goods, and he couldn&#x2019;t help it if they didn&#x2019;t have the right touch. As they&#x2019;re sitting there talking back and forth, his mother is sitting there spinning at the spinning wheel, and she&#x2019;s nodding off and finally she falls asleep. &#x201C;Oh, you&#x2019;re like that,&#x201D; says Jens, &#x201C;let me see if I can&#x2019;t put a little zeal back into you,&#x201D; and with that he grabs a big staff that was right near him and smacks her really hard on the back of her head, the poor old thing, and she falls off the chair and remains lying there. &#x201C;Wow, you&#x2019;re a dangerous guy,&#x201D; says the man, &#x201C;you just killed your own mother.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Oh, there&#x2019;s no danger of that,&#x201D; says Jens, and he shakes her a bit. &#x201C;Yes, she&#x2019;s probably beyond that,&#x201D; they say. &#x201C;No, there&#x2019;s no danger of that,&#x201D; and he reaches up to a shelf and takes a whistle that&#x2019;s lying there and bends down to the back of her head and begins blowing. And the hag jumps right up, &#x201C;Oh, I was having such a nice dream.&#x201D; She sits down to spin as if nothing had happened and spins so that the spinning wheel crackles. Well, the men look a little at this. &#x201C;You know what, Jens,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;if you&#x2019;ll give us that whistle, then we&#x2019;ll forget the whole hat comedy thing,&#x201D; because they could use that whistle, their women were so tired of them. Well, they got the whistle and they went home quite happy. Then the man in the western farm says, &#x201C;I sure as heck want to try the whistle first, you tried the hat first. This time there&#x2019;s no cheating because was saw that the old woman was dead and came back to life.&#x201D;
     The next evening he&#x2019;s sitting inside in the living room with his women and is eagerly waiting for one of them to fall asleep so that he could try this thing. Well, it was now this and now that, because these were some darn strong women, so if they didn&#x2019;t hit them pretty hard, he risked getting it right back. He sat there and thought about that. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re going to hit, then you really need to hit hard, otherwise it won&#x2019;t work,&#x201D; he thought to himself. Then after a while, the wife fell asleep and she slept soundly. Now he&#x2019;d put a really thick cudgel in a corner to use for that purpose, he pulls it out and he smacks her one right in the face and she falls over as dead as a herring. &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; the others say, and they jump up shouting and yelling, &#x201C;Did you kill your own wife? You&#x2019;re quite a daring person!&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Oh, there&#x2019;s no danger,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll wake her up again, don&#x2019;t complain.&#x201D; He takes the whistle and blows it in the back of her head, so water came out of both his eyes, but it didn&#x2019;t help. Then he says to the others: &#x201C;Now you&#x2019;d better keep quiet about this, because my neighbor sure as heck has to try this, I don&#x2019;t want to be the only one to be hurt like this.&#x201D; To make a long story short, exactly the same thing happened to the other one. 
     Now they were busy for several days getting their wives buried and so Jens had peace for a while. In the meantime, some gypsies had wandered by and had gotten lodgings at Jens&#x2019;s and they had a foreign animal with them they called a wolf. They had left it with him and he had no idea what he should do with that animal. Then a little later the men come down to him one day and begin to blame him, saying he had killed their wives and all that. To that he answers, &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m not at fault there, because you saw what I did, and you must have hit wrong. But I&#x2019;ve gotten a ram here and I&#x2019;ll give it to you so we can stay friends.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;He looks like he&#x2019;s pulling a bit at the ropes,&#x201D; says the other man. &#x201C;Yes, he is,&#x201D; said Jens, &#x201C;but it&#x2019;s a foreign race and he is healthy and energetic, and the real advantage with him is that when he is put out in a flock of sheep, there&#x2019;ll be no illness among them.&#x201D; In those days, they had a really hard time keeping their sheep alive, because they always got sick. &#x201C;And there&#x2019;s one more thing&#x2014;he&#x2019;s really good at taking care of the lambs, and when you have him, the foxes won&#x2019;t get a single lamb.&#x201D; They finally thought that it was worth having. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s have him, something is better than nothing,&#x201D; they said, and they got this ram and led him home. 
     They had their sheepfold down below the farms and just at that time the fields were covered with snow, so they had driven all their sheep into a single fold, because the two men always drove their sheep together. When they released the wolf into the sheep, they said to their people: &#x201C;Now you&#x2019;re not to check on them for a few days, he needs to time to get to know them, otherwise he&#x2019;ll run away when the sheep are let out again.&#x201D; Well, the end of the ballad was that the wolf bit a bunch of sheep to death and broke a hole in the roof and ran away and they didn&#x2019;t see the ram again. When the people came to see to their sheep, they lay there in terrible shape.
     Now a little time passed and the men went about wondering about what kind of animal it was that had eaten their sheep. Finally it occurred to them that Jens had played a trick on them. But now the winter had gotten so harsh, there was nothing they could do to him. 
     But Jens hadn&#x2019;t gotten lazy during that time. He had gone down and bought himself an old nag, and he&#x2019;d housed it there in his house. Then toward spring time, the men came down to him one day and they immediately see this nag. &#x201C;What kind of a beast is that you&#x2019;ve gotten yourself Jens?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a lot to earn with that beast,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;it doesn&#x2019;t look like much, but it&#x2019;s good anyway.&#x201D; Now he had seen the men coming, and he&#x2019;d tied a basket onto its ass. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean, that basket hanging there like that?&#x201D; they say. &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;that way I don&#x2019;t have to bother picking the money out of the shit.&#x201D; Well, then they wanted to go have a look in the basket, and there was a bunch of dung but also some copper coins. &#x201C;What, can that animal give money?&#x201D; they say. &#x201C;Sure, you can see that yourself,&#x201D; and at the same time he smacks the animal&#x2019;s ass. Then some shillings trickle out from its tail. &#x201C;Well, it sure looks that way,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;it would certainly be worth it, having an animal like that.&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; says Jens, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s a good investment this animal, but not for me since I can&#x2019;t afford to give it as good food as it needs. The better food it gets, the more money it gives.&#x201D; Well, the end of the ballad was that they got Jens to give them the animal and then they led it home. The man in the west farm got it first and he let it go about in one of his best rooms and he carried a bunch of oats in to it, and a bunch of bed clothes so that it would be comfortable, since he figured the better it lay the more money he&#x2019;d get. But it soon turned out that the nag ruined everything and still did not make any money. The other man got to try it too and it went the same way for him. 
     Now it could well be that they had gotten mad at Jens and they agree with each other: &#x201C;Now we&#x2019;re going to destroy him, otherwise he&#x2019;ll destroy us.&#x201D; So they went down there again and they catch him and put him in a sack they&#x2019;d brought with them. They now set off with him in the sack and since their path went right past the church, they decided they would go in and listen to the minister. They could leave him lying quietly outside the church wall, and so they toss the sack down and go in. As he&#x2019;s lying there, he says quite loudly, &#x201C;No I don&#x2019;t ever want to go to heaven.&#x201D; An old man is walking by at that moment and he hears that. &#x201C;I certainly want to go to heaven if I can.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, you can get there easily,&#x201D; says Jens in the sack, &#x201C;if you&#x2019;ll climb into this sack, we&#x2019;d better switch places, because I&#x2019;m going to heaven right now.&#x201D; The old man opened up the sack for Jens and he climbs out, and the old man climbed into the bag and Jens ties it up good and tight for him. 
     When the Hemstok men had listened to the end of the sermon, they go out and pick up the bag again and then they head off with it. This old guy asked them, &#x201C;Will we get there soon?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, it won&#x2019;t be long now, before you get there,&#x201D; they say and he was happy with that. When they got down to Ravn lake, they threw him out there and then they went home. But along the way between the lake and Boes, they pass Jens, he was driving a big herd of cows, they were some of the men&#x2019;s own cows that wandered about loose in the forest and he had gone there and now was driving a herd of them. &#x201C;What, are you here? Where did you find those cows?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, I found them at the bottom of the lake. There&#x2019;s a wonderful pasture, and there were so many cows grazing there.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Oh really,&#x201D; they said, &#x201C;we&#x2019;d better go down and get us a herd as well, when it&#x2019;s like that. But now we&#x2019;ll be careful and only one of us will go at a time, and when he gets down there and it turns out to be true, what the boy has told us, then he&#x2019;ll call up.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s what happened. When the first one jumped out, it said &#x201C;Plom!&#x201D; and the other one thought he said, &#x201C;Come!&#x201D; and so he jumped in after him. Then they both drowned because of their greed. Since then, Jens and his mother lived peacefully and they acted like people did back then.

The teller has also heard the story told with one more event. Jens had gotten hold of a fox and then convinces them that it&#x2019;s a gander. They lead it up to their goose pen and let it stay with the geese. It killed all of them, and then it broke a hole in the wall and ran off, and they never saw it again.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The boy's unintentional comparison between the minister and a load of manure reveals the deep ambivalence that many rural workers felt toward the minister. Up until the constitutional reform in mid century, the minister was the local representative of the Crown. Even after these reforms, the minister maintained an important role in parish politics.

    Prior to 1849, all farms had to provide transportation to the parish for official business, and this extended to driving for the minister. Many farmers found this to be burdensome since it often required them to interrupt their farm work, or to make do with fewer workers and fewer horses to help with the work.</annotation>

    <annotation>Peder's third session with Tang Kristensen begins with this description of a supernatural creature more commonly referred to as natravn or night raven. The night raven is closely related to haunts (DS  II C 104 and II C 112), and in particular, the haunts of suicides (DS II C 106). In Peder's story, there is no indication that the raven had at one point been a human. In Danske sagn, the story is situated somewhat unusually in a section with stories about a giant bird that kills a bull, a story best known from the collections of Ole Worm (DS II C 118).

    The motif of ravens participating in battle might be linked to Nordic mythology (Sk&#xE1;ldskapam&#xE1;l 60), which had been made broadly available to the Danish rural populace in large part through the efforts of NFS Grundtvig, and the h&#xF8;jskole movement. 

     Svend Grundtvig proposes that the word valravn is related to the word varulv or werewolf, since in his interpretation, the valravn is a person who assumes the shape of a raven (DgF II, 480). This interpretation of the valravn derives from the ballad tradition, but does not align with Peder's description here. Rather, Peder's description aligns better with one of the etymologies that Grundtvig discards, namely the Old Icelandic word valr, which means "the slain in battle" (the name of Odin's hall, Valh&#xF6;ll, hall of the battle slain, derives from valr, and offers an analogous example of compound formation with the stem val-).

     The valravn appears in Danish ballad tradition (see in particular DgF 60; also DgF 61 and 62). The ballad was included in Vedel's collection and was also popular as a broadsheet (DgF II, 479). Oehlenschl&#xE4;ger also wrote a poem, Valravnen (1803), that was based on the ballad German Gladesvend (DgF 33). Given Peder's description of the creature, it is unlikely that he was aware of the ballad or Oehlenschl&#xE4;ger's poem.</annotation>

    <annotation>Mistreating a changeling is a common strategy for getting one's child back. Changelings were generally identified by unusually slow (or fast) development, and unusual physical features. Many of these physical and behavioral characteristics of the "changeling" may have had factual counterparts attributable to birth defects, genetic disorders, or other early childhood illnesses (M&#xF8;ller 1940).

     A changeling comes about when trolls steal a newborn human child and replace it with one of their own. This switch can only take place before the child is baptized. In some stories, the changeling is shown to be quite old. Frequently, the explicit motivation for the changing is the desire of the troll mother to have her child baptized, thus guaranteeing the troll child salvation (and depriving the human child of the same).

     Sewing crosses, or otherwise using Christian iconography in the house, over or in the infant's bed, or on the infant's clothes were broadly considered efficacious against the threat of being switched. The loss of a child could have significant impact on a rural family, particularly if the child, because of its "changed" shape (e.g. deformity or mental deficiency) could not contribute to the economy of the farm. The danger was that the child, rather than assisting in domestic chores, small farming tasks, and later offering his parents a retirement (aft&#xE6;gt) arrangement, would be a constant drain on the household economy. In the worst case, the changeling might force the family into the care of the parish poverty assistance administration.

      The switch to narrative from shorter rhymes and descriptions of folk belief suggests that Peder had "warmed up" and was now ready to tell more stories. This session is more fractured than the earlier sessions with longer narratives interspersed with shorter descriptions, sayings, or rhymes.</annotation>

    <annotation>The mare is another supernatural being that shares qualities with the werewolf and the natravn (night raven). In all of these cases, people assume the form of an animal; these creatures are usually most active at night. The close connection between mares and werewolves is further attested in numerous legends (DS II F 62).

     The mare climbs on top of people or horses at night and "rides" them (KMP 1.37; DS II F 93-95) (Raudvere 1993). The victims usually suffer greatly and in some stories, die. There are some accounts of the mare riding plows, a belief that links the mare to the Wandering Jew (DS II F 106; KMP 2.02). The mare's actions take direct aim at the physical and economic well-being of the farm.

     Belief in the mare is related to the English word nightmare. In Danish, the word for a bad dream is mareridt or, literally, "mare ridden."

     There are numerous strategies for dealing with the mare--often these strategies include Christian symbolism, such as the use of crosses. The best known "cross" for the mare is the marekors, an eight-pointed star, drawn in one continuous stroke (DS II F 90; KMP 1.37). Pouring water on the mare would usually stop the riding and reveal the mare's true identity (DS II F 73). Other stories tell of trapping the mare (DS II F 65). Turning one's clogs is also a well known prophylactic against the mare climbing into one's bed. The efficacy of this relies on the inversion of the clogs since the inverted status of the supernatural can be counteracted by another inversion.

     The use of threshing knives, or other sharp objects, to catch and punish the mare is also widely attested (DS II F 54). The ensuing injury to the mare appears on the body of the person who transforms into the mare at night. This mode of capturing (and punishing) the mare is similar to various strategies for revealing the identity of a witch in hare's form, or the witch who rides a person to the witches' Sabbath. This last phenomenon is closely related to the phenomenon of being ridden by the mare.

     Peder's suggestion that a person who is a mare has eyebrows that grow together over their nose is widely attested (DS II F 50). It is also known as a characteristic of people who are werewolves (DS II F 8).</annotation>

    <annotation>The discussion of the mare leads into a story about the ride of the witches on their way to their Sabbath. It is interesting to note that Peder's witches are men.

     The witches' ride to Troms church usually takes place on Skt. Hans eve (June 23rd) or Valborg eve (April 30th). Troms church is in Troms&#xF8; in Norway. This location makes the church sufficiently distant and, since it is built on an island off the northwest coast of Norway, sufficiently remote to be a conceptually impossible place to reach.

     Witches were commonly thought to rest in church steeples along the way, and this leads to the amusing conversation between the two witches Peder recounts here.</annotation>

    <annotation>Bell inscriptions were quite varied. While many referenced the date the bell was placed, playful, amusing or surprising bell inscriptions were not unusual. The bell in Dover church was cast by Jacob Rendler in 1747. It is unclear if this is the bell to which Peder is referring.

     Tang Kristensen was interested in bell inscriptions, and in Minder og Oplevelser describes how he made side trips to see church bells (MO IV 88) or takes rubbings of various bell inscriptions (MO III 217). He also wrote several articles about church bells, including several in H&#xF8;jskolebladet in 1888.</annotation>

    <annotation>Acquiring significant wealth was often attributed, at least in legend, to a pact with the devil. Exceptional personal gain was, in a limited good model, seen as coming at the expense of others (Foster 1959). Making a pact with the devil would guarantee wealth, but it would also underscore one's willingness to transgress the boundaries of the human community for personal gain. 

     Not surprisingly, the main character in stories about pacts with the devil often come from the wealthy classes: merchants and large land owners. The stories may act as a form of narrative revenge, chipping away at the power and prestige of the wealthy by telling stories of their unholy alliances. The resolution of these stories usually consists of the main human character's grisly death, a fitting punishment for eschewing god and, by extension, the community. 

     Peder's story includes an interesting interlude in which Lavst tricks the devil. In many variants, the person who tricks the devil is a wise minister. Leaving something undone--in this case, his stockings--is a common ruse. Other tricks include asking to wait until a candle burns down, and then extinguishing it (DS VI 95), or asking to be allowed to put on one's clothes, and then leaving a button undone (DS VI 87). The ruse, however, only lasts so long, and Lavst eventually has to make good on his side of the bargain. 

     The merchant class was conservative. In the st&#xE6;nderforsamling (local assemblies) and later in the Rigsdag (parliament), the merchants from the market towns generally supported the policies of the urban mercantilists, the civil servants and the large land owners. This political stance was in direct opposition to that of the rural farming and cotter class. It is not surprising, then, that Peder would tell a story in which a stalwart of the merchant class turns out to be in league with the devil.

     Peder's story of a pact with the devil is somewhat unusual in the precise attention to detail in his description of Satan. In many stories, Satan is personified (as he is in the Bible) (Valk 2001). The description of a thin-faced man in black with a long cape, with a long mustache and pointy beard is in line with other descriptions of Satan. In other legends, he is also described as having horns and cloven feet (DS VI 471; DS VI 478).

      The description of Satan's carriage is also typical. A lone traveler in a carriage pulled by two black horses suggests significant wealth. The glowing wheels are at once ominous and suggestive of extraordinary speed. The speed of the devil's travel is confirmed by the short time it takes him to reach Skanderborg, meet with Lavst Thomsen and return.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was a man in Skanderborg who was called Lavst Thomsen, he was a skilled merchant and was quite well-off, but he'd sworn himself to the Devil and bought all his riches from him. There went a while, he became a bit of a drunk, and it looked as if things were starting to backslide. People believed that it was because he was worried about this and time was passing, and every day he was closer to him. One day a man from Flensted, Frederik comes driving along and he passed a wagon that had glowing red wheels below and and it was driven by the man himself and there was no one else in the wagon. There two coal black horses pulling it. It was a summer day but steam came out of the horses' noses as if it was a hard frost. He had a cape thrown over his shoulders, a pointy beard and a whiplash mustache, his face was thin and he looked quite sinister. He met him near H&#xE5;rby and when he got to Forlev, the other one was coming back, but he didn't think any more about that and continued on to Skanderborg. When he got there, he went in to Lavst Thomsen's place to do some shopping and his nephew was an apprentice shopkeeper there. Then he told him that the Devil had been there, and he'd stood and listened by the keyhole and heard what had been said. "Well," he says when he came in, "now the time is up." - "Yes it is," answered the merchant, "if you'll give me a moment while I tie up my one stocking, then I'll come along." - "I'll allow that," and then he let it hang and never again tied up his stocking. Then the Evil One had lost his power. But they believed that he'd gotten control over him anyway at some point and had cast some spells so a few years later he wound up in a peat ditch and there he'd sat and frozen to death. When the man heard this from the apprentice shopkeeper, he knew that the wagon had been the Devil's. Frederik sat here with us and told us that. His widow is still alive.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en mand i Skanderborg, der hed Lavst Thomsen, han var en dygtig kj&#xF6;bmand og i stor velstand; men al hans rigdom havde han kj&#xF6;bt af Fanden, som han havde forskrevet sig til. S&#xE5; gik der en tid, han blev lidt fordrukken, og det s&#xE5; ud, som det gik lidt tilbage ad. Folk mente jo, det var af &#xE6;rgrelse over, at han kom ham hver dag n&#xE6;rmere. En dag kommer en mand kj&#xF8;rende, der hed Frederik og var fra Flensted, og han kom forbi en vogn, der var gloende r&#xF8;de hjul under og to kulsorte b&#xE6;ster for. Det var om sommerdage, og endda dampede b&#xE6;sterne ud af n&#xE6;sen som i en h&#xE5;rd klingrende frost. Der var kun &#xE9;n mand p&#xE5; vognen, og han havde en kappe sl&#xE5;et over skuldrene, havde et spidst fipskj&#xE6;g og et snoet overskj&#xE6;g, var skaven (mager) i ansigtet og s&#xE5; ret skummel ud i det hele. Han m&#xF6;dte ham ovenfor H&#xE5;rby, og da han kom til Forlev, da kom den anden tilbage, men han t&#xE6;nkte sig jo ikke videre ved det og blev ved til Skanderborg. S&#xE5; gik han ind til Lavst Thomsens, for der var hans s&#xF8;skendebarn kr&#xE6;mmersvend. S&#xE5; fort&#xE6;ller han ham, te Fanden havde v&#xE6;ret der, han havde st&#xE5;et og luret ved n&#xF8;glehullet og kunnet h&#xF8;re, hvad der blev sagt. "Ja," siger Fanden, da han kom ind, "nu er tiden omme," &#x2014; "Ja, den er s&#xE5;," svarte kj&#xF6;bmanden, "n&#xE6;renstid du vil nu lade mig have ro, mens a bindere mit ene hoseb&#xE5;nd, s&#xE5; vil a med." &#x2014; "Det er dig tilst&#xE5;et," og s&#xE5; lod Lavst det h&#xE6;nge og havde ingen tider siden hans hoseb&#xE5;nd bundet. S&#xE5; havde den Slemme tabt magten. Folk mener dog, at han var kommen over ham alligevel en gang og havde koglet for ham, s&#xE5; han rendte i en t&#xF6;rvegrav nogle &#xE5;r efter, og der sad han og var frossen ihjel. Da manden fra Flensted h&#xF8;rte kr&#xE6;mmersvendens meddelelse, vidste han jo, at den vogn var Fandens. Frederik har siddet inde hos vores og fortalt det; hans enke er til endnu.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a man in Skanderborg who was called Lavst Thomsen, he was a skilled merchant and was quite well off; but he&#x2019;d bought all his riches from the devil with whom he had made a contract. Then a little while passed and he became a bit of a drunk, and things started to backslide. People believed that it was because he was worried that every day he was one day closer to the devil. One day a man comes driving, he was called Frederik and came from Flensted, and he passed a wagon that had glowing red wheels below and two coal black horses in front. Even though it was a summer day, steam came out of the noses of the horses as if it was a hard frost.

Frederik met him near H&#xE5;rby and when he got to Forlev, the other one was already on his way back, but he didn&#x2019;t think anything about that and continued to Skanderborg.

    <annotation>The devil and witches are closely related. Witches are an insidious threat to a community, since they come from within. In many stories, witches steal milk from the neighbors' cows after turning themselves into a hare (DS  VII 106), or by using sticks or other mundane objects (DS VII 584; DS VII 592). There was a strong belief that witches taught their children, particularly their daughters, how to be witches as well. 

     By the end of the nineteenth century, accusations of witchcraft had lost much of the legal power that they had had in the seventeenth century when proof of witchcraft could lead to a death sentence. Most discussions of witchcraft in the nineteenth century were more centered around folk healing. 

     The witch's strategy of meeting the threat of prosecution head on with a counter threat--and a plague of lice--is interesting. She at once confirms that she is indeed a witch (she has the power to visit a plague of lice on her accusers), and at the same time sidesteps prosecution. She seemingly avoids community censure, except for the fact that a narrative exists accusing her of witchcraft.

     Skjoldelev is twenty-five kilometers north east of Fuldbro Mill.</annotation>

    <annotation>Peder's story of the wise minister who is able to bind thieves explores in part the thin line between witchcraft and cunning. Witchcraft is always exercised for personal gain and always harms people in the community, either physically, economically, or both. Cunning, in contrast, is always used to protect the community from outside threat, be it a threat to property or to physical well being. 

     There were two classes of cunning folk: ministers, and lay persons. Here, the minister uses his cunning to protect his own apples from theft. The apples represent a modest, but important part of the agricultural income that was a component of his compensation.

     That the thief is someone from the community calls to mind the image of the witch, who likewise steals from community members, and who is often confronted by the minister. Unlike the witch in the previous story, the thief is duly chastised by the local authorities, here in the guise of the minister.

     Ane Margrete Jensdatter tells a story of another wise minister who was similarly able to use his cunning for the benefit of the community (AMJ 1.06).</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories about giants and trolls who try to silence church bells by throwing stones are quite common. Frequently, a landscape feature such as a rock with a hand print provides verification of the story (DS III 81; DS III 122). Supernatural beings, who are not Christian, often complain about the ringing of the bells (DS III 215). Bells were rung not only for regular church services, but also for special services such as weddings and funerals. 

     Svejstrup lies approximately 1 kilometer southwest of Dover church on a straight line with Boes field, which lies approximately 2.5 kilometers from the church. Given the distance, the troll cannot be faulted for not being able to reach the bells with a large stone.</annotation>

    <annotation>Peder continues with descriptions of unusual finds in the local landscape. The description of a stone altar, and his story about its presumed use, allows him to emerge as an expert about local history. The suggestion is that this particular stone setting was a remnant of the middle ages. The earliest Nordic history was a topic that had gained great popularity in Denmark during the nineteenth century in large part due to the work of the theologian NFS Grundtvig and the folk high school movement.</annotation>

    <annotation>Numerous legends tell of church bells lost in lakes or rivers, sometimes due to the corruption or ungodliness of the person casting the bell (DS III 527; DS III 531; DS III 533; DS III 535). Other reasons include attempted theft of the bell (DS III 529).

     The bell represents a significant investment on the part of the community--or a benefactor of the community--and its loss would be quite significant. Economically, it is hard to imagine a small community being able to easily replace their bell. More important are the implications of the bell for community solidarity, as church bells were a clear sonic symbol of the community, used to call people together, to celebrate events, and to warn of calamity. It is worth noting that after his death, Peder willed a large sum of money to Skanderborg church to cast a new bell.

     Lindow, in his discussion of the Delsbo churchbell, traces the loss of a bell in a lake to Gustav Wasa's repayment of the "L&#xFC;beck debt," the debt he incurred in his fight against Christian II of Denmark (Lindow 1978, 63). No such historical background exists for this story of the Venge church bells.</annotation>

    <annotation>Peder's story of the disappearance of Mos lake borders on the apocryphal. Mos lake is Denmark's fourth largest lake with an area of seventeen square kilometers.

     It is unclear who the Turk to whom he alludes might be, although the Turk is mentioned in numerous other apocryphal legends (DS II G 339). The Turk may be an allusion to stories of Holger Danske and his fight against a Turkish king. Turks were often represented as a frightening, distant yet threatening group. In some legends, there is an implication that the Turkish king would eventually overthrow the Danish crown (DS II G 351). In several legends, the Turks are replaced with Germans, a substitution that resonates with the clear threat of Bismark's Prussia from the 1860s up through the end of the nineteenth century (DS II G 340). The substitution of German for Turk is linguistically simple given the closeness in Danish between the words "tyrkere" (Turk) and "tyskere" (German).

     Given immigration patterns in the past forty years to Denmark, there is a strong possibility that someone from Turkey has swum in the lake. At the same time, it seems somewhat unlikely that any modern Dane of Turkish heritage has cattle that need watering. Mos s&#xF8; is still quite large and shows no signs of turning into a stream.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories about apocalyptic changes in the landscape (PJ 3.15) leads Peder to make several short comments on local topography. The Danish landscape, particularly that of Jutland, changed fairly radically during the nineteenth century. Heathland was drained and turned into arable land, mounds were leveled both for marl and to make plowing and harvesting more efficient, and drain tile was laid to make drainage across fields consistent. All of these developments led to noticeable, and at times surprising, changes to seemingly stable features of the landscape.</annotation>

    <annotation>The hollows to which Peder refers also appear in stories about robbers (JPP 2.02 and 2.20). Peder's meta-narrative comment about storytelling implies that stories about the hollow were once well known. At the very least, the comment shows that he assumes that there were stories attached to the location, given its noteworthy name. "Who was this count?" one is inclined to ask.</annotation>

    <annotation>Peder's story of a strong man resonates with his other stories of strong, capable, but often tricky farmhands (PJ 1.02, 2.27 and 4.04). The count approaches Kristen with the proposition of a paid fight, although the implication is that the count views the fight almost as if it were part of Kristen's villeinage. Kristen knows he has the upper hand in this negotiation, and repeats the common complaint of farm workers that he is neither fed well enough nor housed well enough (PJ 2.26). 

     Unlike most aristocrats, the count turns out to be quite generous, interested only in the (Danish) victory, and offers to pay Kristen the proceeds from the bet. In other variants, the bet is smaller (JAH II 412) or the pay out is forgiveness of Kristen's outstanding farm debt (JAH II 414). This latter version has Kristen then entering the newly emergent class of smallholders, a significant change in status for him. In this context, it is worth noting that Kristen only gains his financial independence through a game of chance; despite strength, and obvious prowess on the farm as attested in the second story, Kristen would not otherwise have a chance to earn the money necessary to become independent. The story can be read as a rather depressing commentary on the structure of the Danish rural economy.

      The victory of the Danish strongman over the English strongman likely reflects the bitterness that Danes still felt over the defeat of the Danish navy and the bombardment of Copenhagen by the Brits in 1807. The subsequent downward spiral of the Danish kingdom in European politics and trade still resonated throughout Denmark up through the nineteenth century. Against a backdrop of repeated setbacks to an army composed almost entirely of peasants, including resounding defeat at the hands of the English and the Prussians, a victory of a Danish farmhand over an English strongman must have had clear appeal.

     In another variant of this story, told by J. Jensen from Refshaleg&#xE5;rd, the count is identified as the lord at Frisenborg (Frijsenborg) (JA II 412). Frisenborg is approximately four kilometers north-east of Voldby. The farms at Voldby, prior to the partitioning of fields, would have belonged to Frisenborg. Tang Kristensen includes this identification of the count in Peder's story even though it does not appear in the manuscript.

     The grevskab (countship) at Frisenborg was established in 1672, and included lands valued at 22,000 barrels of hartkorn, spread across four districts (amt). It was the largest estate in Denmark at the time. In the 1860s, the count, a konseilspr&#xE6;sident and accordingly a politically powerful figure (as a senior member of the parliament), rebuilt the main building. The farm is still privately held by Count Bent Wedell. In the mid twentieth century, his father acquired through marriage another manor farm, Wedellsborg, in western Fyn. The holdings now play a major role in Danish agriculture and forestry.

     Tang Kristensen made minor changes in the published version, particularly in the short, humorous story at the end, deleting Kristen's direct speech. Perhaps Tang Kristensen wanted to paint a picture of Kristen as a man of few words.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Kristen S&#xF8; could take the Hammel church bell and stand and ring it between his legs, yet it took six men to hoist it up using block and tackle when they were done building. One came here from England, a contraption (a person), who was supposed to break horses and he became a bit too brave, since he could knock any and everyone to the ground, he was in Copenhagen, offered 500 rigsdaler to the person who could get him to the ground. So the count and a couple of gentlemen get to talking about this. Then the count says, "But we have the man here on the estate who can get him down," and he sends for Kristen S&#xF8;. When he gets up there, he says to him, "Listen, Kristen, you like to earn money by chance. Here's a job, wouldn't you like to try it? I'll pay for your trip over there and your expenses, as long as it lasts." - "Well, it depends on what the job is," because he was very cautious when he spoke. "Well, now you'll hear." "Nahh," says Kristen, "I don't think I can do that, since I work too much and get too little food." But he was a bit of a thief. "Oh, is it nothing more than that?" says the count. "How many days do you think you need to live well for?" "Well," says Kristen, "I think I'd better have fourteen days' time." "OK, you come up here to the farm tomorrow." Then Kristen came and enjoyed himself during those fourteen days. When he heads off, he says, "OK, I'm not guaranteeing that I'll knock this fellow over." "OK, as long as you do what you can, we don't expect any more." They start fighting. They were supposed to knock each other to the ground three times. The [English guy] grabs a hold of him and he worked on Kristen so that it crunched. Finally he knocks him head over heels. Then he was going to start working on him again. Then Kristen says quite gently, "It isn't worth working so hard since you've got to do this once more." He realized that Kristen was poking fun at him. This time he knocked Kristen to his knees. But then Kristen got angry, because he hurt himself. Then they were going to go at it for the third time, but then people got to see how strong he was. He grabbed the guy's belt and drove him down toward the ground so that he never was much of a person after that. The manor lord was so happy when he got home. "That was really well done Kristen." And he got his pay. A man came from the west and wanted to find him. Kristen had a small plot and two oxen, and he went and plowed with them. He took hold of one of the plow horns and pointed with the plow. "He lives over there." "Well, then I certainly don't need to ask where the man is."</english_manuscript>

Endelig v&#xE6;lter han ham over ende. S&#xE5; skulde han jo til det nok en gang. Da siger Kristen helt sagtmodig: "Nu er det ikke v&#xE6;rd, du arbejder slet s&#xE5; h&#xE5;rdt, for du har jo to gange til." Han kunde da forst&#xE5; s&#xE5; meget, te Kristen vilde gj&#xF8;re nar ad ham. Den gang slog han ham ned i kn&#xE6;erne. Men da blev Kristen vred, for den gang st&#xF8;dte han sig.

      Der kom en mand ude vester fra og vilde have ham ledt op. Kristen havde s&#xE5; meget avling som til et par stude, og dem gik han og pl&#xF6;jede med. Han tog nu i det ene plovhorn og pegte med. "Ja, s&#xE5; behover a missel ikke at sp&#xF6;rge om, hvor manden er."</danish_publication>

    <annotation>There are numerous stories that tell about vipers, and both the danger and supernatural power associated with them (DS II E 119). Vipers, particularly white vipers, often figure in folk remedies (DS II E 108). It is likely that the man had intended to use the viper as part of a magical cure. Vipers are also considered in some stories to be difficult or impossible to kill (DS II E 125). In other stories, the vipers are known to hold grudges against their tormentors (DS II E 115). It is likely this latter belief that motivates the farmhand to release the viper from his torment.

    Vipers are the only venomous snake in Denmark, and their bite, while poisonous, is most dangerous to children, the elderly, or the infirm.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>A man had [hired] someone to plow for him. They were breaking heather in Gjern heath, and there were a huge number of snakes. Then there comes a really big one. The one who was driving says to the other one: "Watch this!" and then he drew a line around the snake with his staff shaped like a pretzel, he might have said something too, but it's enough to know that the snake began to slither as fast as it could around on this pretzel line. Then the man went home for lunch and says to the other: "Now don't kill it, because it's supposed to keep running until it runs itself to death." Now this man went and plowed and he looked over to the snake because he was thinking about it, he thought that it was a shame and so he decided to go over and take his whip and kill the snake. As soon as he'd done that, the other man is standing there and says: "You killed it, even though I asked you not to. See, if you'd known what you were doing there, then you wouldn't have done it."

    <annotation>Stampeding animals were a danger not only to the animals (they could easily trip and break a leg on the fields, which would require them to be killed), but also to the shepherds (who could be trampled) and to the fields (where crops could be trampled). Accordingly, the ability to stop a stampede would be greatly valued. Here, the stopping of the stampede relies on supernatural intervention (KMP 1.38). In many cases, the person who stops the stampede is a cunning person (DS VI 1004); in some cases, the stampede is caused by a witch (AMJ 2.20). The cost of stopping the stampede is nevertheless significant, and leaves a clear imprint on the farm's economy, as horses were a greatly valued asset.</annotation>

    <annotation>Lights are commonly believed to burn over treasures (PJ 2.10). Peder adds that lights also burn over things that are hidden or secret. The kongelys (king light) is clearly related to the notion of buried treasures left behind by kings or treasures large enough to ransom a king (PJ 2.10). The notion of a light burning over a buried treasure is similar to the Anglo-American belief of a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Just as with the rainbow's end, it is impossible to reach a kongelys.</annotation>

    <annotation>Stories of people born in a victory shirt are widely attested (DS  VII 1478). In many cases, these shirts provide protection against bullets and guarantee victory in battle. Among others, Holger Danske (DS VII 1482) and Frederik VII (DS VII 1488) are said to have been born with such shirts. Amusingly, Peder is not the only storyteller who muses over the outcome of a child born with a victory shirt who does not live up to expectations (DS VII 1481). It is likely that the victory shirt referred to in these accounts is the placental membrane.</annotation>

Tang Kristensen collected numerous stories in which children give unexpected or amusing answers to the questions of ministers (VFK 152; VFK 164).

     Tang Kristensen does not publish this story in any of his collections, probably because of the borderline obscene nature of the boy's response.

    <annotation>This story is a variant of a story Peder had told many years earlier (PJ 2.29).  There are some minor differences between the accounts. This variant provides greater detail about the actions of the parish clerk, while the earlier story provides slightly different detail about the ringing of the church bells. The published version expands considerably on the manuscript variant, and Tang Kristensen alters the position of certain phrases, presumably for greater comic and dramatic effect. This story is published in Vore f&#xE6;dres kirketjeneste (1899), underscoring Tang Kristensen's apparently deliberate decision not to publish the preceding story (PJ 4.01).</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>The parish clerk in Mjessing used to eat his lunch in the weapon house while he was ringing. The bells were rung three times. The parsonage's chickens had found their way in to him and he gave them crumbs from his bread and they liked this. Then the minister came in to hurry him up, he was to go in and ring. He thought it didn't look so good having chickens in there and he takes his felt hat and starts swinging it about to get them out with some finality, but he's unlucky enough to hit the rooster so it falls over. So there won't be anymore accidents he takes it and puts it in his pocket. He goes out to ring and doesn't remember the rooster. He goes in and gets the minister into his garb and does his duty with the songs and gets the minister up to the pulpit. Like most parish clerks, he sat down and started sleeping. A little later, the rooster comes to life, out of his pocket and looks around a bit. Then it takes the straightest path up to the altar and starts crowing the best it has learned. The minister would usually raise his voice near the end so the parish clerk would wake up and then he says, Amen.</english_manuscript>

    <annotation>Peder situates many of his stories in the immediate landscape and draws on topographical features to validate the story. His story here also details the type of conflict between farms that animates many of his other stories. Interestingly, the conflict here is entirely contained within the large land owning class, a parallel to one of the first stories he told Tang Kristensen (PJ 2.01). The end result of the feud is the economic devastation of both farms. 

     Sofiendal is approximately 10 kilometers north east of Fuldbro. The lake's name should be amended to Pitters&#xF8; or Pitter Lake.  The lake is now nothing more than a stream.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>North and east of Sofiendal, up there where Old Farm now is, and nearby the lake that they called Pitte Lake, which is dried up now, there was a farm which was called Gravold, and there are supposed to be ruins of it still. According to old talk, this farm was owned by Ranild Jonsen. On the southern side of Mos lake there was a manor farm, and these two manor lords feuded with each other. And so they rode against each other one Christmas Eve to set fire to each others' farms and they passed each other near the end of Mos S&#xF8; here by Fuldbro M&#xF8;lle. They succeeded too and since that time Gravold has been deserted and was never rebuilt. It wasn't R. Jonsen, the one, they didn't recognize each other when they met up. They did it on Christmas Eve because that was when the farms were guarded the least and people sat around drinking.</english_manuscript>

They say that the two manor lords feuded with each other, and so they each decided to burn the other one's farm. It was to happen Christmas eve, since on that night, the farms would be guarded the least, because people sat about drinking and enjoying themselves and it was kind of strange that these two made the same decision to attack on the same night, and then they went off and met up, each coming from their own way around Mos Lake down here at Fuldbro mill. They didn&#x2019;t recognize each other and continued on their way and were also lucky enough to set each other's farms on fire. Now when they each got home to their own place, their farms lay in ashes. Since that time, both Gravold and the other farm have been deserted.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Peder's folktales often focus on the remarkable deeds of a farmhand who, through quick wit and remarkably lax morals that border on sociopathic behavior, is able to get ahead. This tale, a variant of ATU 650a, "Strong John", is no exception. 

     The story is broken into two distinct parts, although both parts are integral to the tale. The first part focuses on the strong boy and his conflict with his employer. Hans's unusual birth from a goose egg incubated by a beggar (it would be hard to imagine being lower status than that), is not uncommon in such tales. The story then proceeds in a manner that is reminiscent of Peder's other story of dangerous young men (PJ 1.02 and 2.27). One also finds echoes of motifs from some of his legends, in particular the stories about the strong farmhands, Kristen S&#xF8; (PJ 3.18) and Svend Felding (PJ 2.03). 

      Hans's actions are remarkably destructive, and the economic as well as physical survival of the farm is clearly in doubt. Hans's extraordinary ability to work, and the extreme nature of his reactions, parallels the nisse, a figure that also figures in Peder's repertoire (PJ 2.03, 2.11, 2.21-22, 3.07). While having a strong farmhand is usually an asset, here it is a clear liability (PJ 2.03).

     In many ATU 650a tales, the employer only tries to kill the boy once, usually with a millstone. Peder expands the story to include a lengthy journey to visit the devil. The magical helper, the hermit, is dead when Hans passes by--Hans's compassionate treatment of the helper even in death signals a shift in the character from his earlier marked selfishness. 

     When Hans finally returns to the manor farm, the devil calls in the debt that Hans had acquired for the manor lord. In short, Hans enters into a pact with the devil with the two souls of the manor lord and his wife as payment (PJ 3.08). Because of the unusual structure of this agreement, Hans is able to take over the manor farm. Interestingly, Hans's rise from low level to high level is not accompanied with marriage to a high level young female, the usual pattern for an active masculine tale (Holbek 1987). This omission is interesting in light of Peder's own lifelong status as a bachelor.

     The story is indexed in the fair copy collection as &#xC6;v 1967. The published version differs only slightly from the manuscript recording.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>There was an old man, he went about begging as was the custom in the old days. So he goes in to one place and they didn't have anything for him except for a very large goose egg. So he takes it and goes his way. Now he thought that it would be nice to get that egg hatched. He could probably do it himself. Now I've begged for a long time so I can certainly handle lying and resting while I take care of this. Well, then he lay for a while, and something came of it, but it turned out to be a boy. The man wasn't terribly proud of this, but there was nothing else to do but to see that the boy stayed alive. He was one who wanted to thrive and he ate quite a bit, and so it wasn't long before he could carry both everything that he could beg and everything that the old man could beg as well. Well, at some point this here old man made sure that the boy was baptized and had him named Hans, because that's what he was called himself, and so he thought he wanted to have someone named after him. Finally, he got him work with a farmer, and he was to take care of the geese, but that didn't work out because he didn't treat them gently and he killed them, then he lost his job, and so the old man had him once again. He says to him: You're to go up and work for the manor lord since he is quite brusque, and he can thrash you. He goes up to the manor lord with the lad and says such and such, he couldn't have him work anywhere, and would he please take him. Yes, the manor lord was quite happy with him, because nobody would stay there, he chased them away as soon as they came; he could do as he pleased. He goes up there one holiday in the afternoon, and so there wasn't anything to do then, so he was shown his lodgings, a bed out by the other farmhands. The next morning they go in for breakfast, and he is to be assigned his work and the manor lord says he is to go and thresh because it was at the end of the harvest. He couldn't do anything with his flail since it was far too small, and he goes in and complains about this. OK, you can go ahead and make one for yourself. Hans stood threshing there in the barn (hovlade), where it was quite high to the roof peak, and so there was lots of space, and so then he goes over to a little house they had, and tears a bunch of roof beams off and begins to thresh with that. After he has threshed for three days, the manor lord felt that the pile was big enough, and then he says but how are we going to clean that pile of grain, little Hans? --That'll be my business, he answered quite arrogantly, I'll take care of it. Then he knocks out all the walls in the barn and shovels the whole pile up to a point, and he climbs up on top and he blows with his behind down into the pile so that the chaff is blown to all the world's corners. He goes in and says that the grain is done. He asks him to carry it up into the attic of the main house. Sure, but I'll need some sacks to carry it up in. Sure, here were some sacks. Is it little scraps like this that I'm to carry it in! He goes out and gets hold of a couple of horse blankets or three and he sews them together, and he fills this bag with grain and then he puts it on his shoulders and goes off with it. But the door was too narrow, and he rips it out and makes such an opening that he could go in. Then he throws the sack up in the attic right over their nicest rooms, so it fell through and fell down and ruined all their furnishings. Now the manor lord got scared of him. There's no need to do any more today, you can rest until tomorrow. The other farmhands are going to go out to the forest then and cut and drive the winter firewood home, and you can go along with them, because he thought that there it was more about cleverness than strength, and then he'd have other things to think about. The next morning the other farmhands got up in good time because the roads were rough back then, and it was hard to get a load of firewood loaded and driven home by nightfall and then they say: We're not going to call for Hans, and so they drove out to the forest, because he always finished his work early, and he was going to be the last one today. Hans he gets up when it was a bit later in the day, goes out and has his breakfast. He then hitches up the horses and sets off after the others. When he gets to the forest, he says, yes, you little guys, you think you're going to fool me, but it isn't going to go like that, and then he goes over and pulls up a whole bunch of trees and lays them across the road and plants them firmly. When he gets a little farther in, he meets up with the others, they had already loaded up and were ready to head home. Then they said to him, Well, you'll have to comfort yourself with the fact that the moon is shining, you can certainly find your way home." But Hans let them mock him, and then he drove off. He got loaded up in a jiffy, and headed back. They were still standing there and were toiling away to get these trees off the road, and they couldn't get around them with their horses. Hans unhitches his horses from the wagon, leads them around, and lets them stand in front of the trees, goes back around for the wagon and its load, and carries them around to the horses, hitches up again and drives home. Now he'd overloaded his wagon and when he drives in the farm gates, the load gets stuck there. But then he thinks, Now you've got it under roof, let it stand there, he unhitches his horses and goes in and has his dinner. Oh, are the others coming soon? says the manor lord. Yes, it won't be long. The others had to let their loads and their horses stay outside that night, because there was no other entrance to the farm when they finally got there. The next morning, they got up a little earlier than Hans because he wanted to stay in bed a little bit longer and then the manor lord says to them: We need to kill him, or he'll wind up killing us. They were all in agreement, but now the question was how they were going to get rid of him. We'll get rid of him easily, says the manor lord, because as soon as he gets up, we'll have him go down and clean the well, and we have an old millstone lying out there, we'll drop it down on him by accident, and then it'll go that way that he'll be allowed to stay down there. Well, Hans gets up, and the manor lord says to him, Listen, Hans, the water has gone wrong in the well, could you go down and clean it out. The other farmhands can help you and pull the mud up. Sure, there was nothing in the way of doing that. He goes down and begins to dig, and the others haul it up in the bucket. When they've just about cleared out the well, they'd gotten the millstone positioned so that they could easily tickle it down, but they had the misfortune the stone landed next to him without hitting him and then he realized that things were wrong and so he grabbed hold of the eye and put it under his arm and climbed up with it. Then he says to them when he comes up: The next time you want to hit people in the head, you should take better aim than you did this time. If they weren't scared before, they were now. OK, says the manor lord, "don't be so annoyed, it happened by accident, someone stepped on it. Could you do me a favor and go to Hell and get me a daler? I've heard said that the money that comes from there is supposed to go a long way. Sure, I can do that, but how am I supposed to go about asking directions. You can do that, because all you need to do is ask people you meet where Old Erik lives, they'll know, because the one who rules Hell is called Old Erik. Well, then Hans gets a knapsack and he sets off on his journey. After he has gone a while and asked many people the way -- but of course there was no one who could show him the way, he comes to a really big forest, and he comes to a hermit or one like that, and he asks him as well, if he could tell him where Old Erik lived. Then he says, Yes, I certainly can, because I've shown many people there, but not a one has ever come back. But what do you want there? Well, then he told him his errand. Yes, there's nothing in the way of that, and I'm going to set a ball rolling, and it will keep going until it gets to the gate, and then it will stop. But there are three things that you should watch out for. They'll ask you to sit down when you get in there, but you mustn't do that. Then he'll give you the daler in your hand, but you mustn't let him do that. You can simply say: Oh, please put it on the floor, it needs to cool down a bit, then you can take it. And then you need to watch out when you leave, that you don't step on the threshold, you need to do it in one jump, otherwise your feet will be broken. If you can watch out for those three things and get past them well, then I'll be released (from a curse). Go now in the name of God, says the old man, and then he set the ball rolling, and it started rolling, but it didn't roll any faster than Hans could follow along walking. It was a very even road he was to walk, and there was nothing to hinder him and after a while, the ball stops in front of a large gate, there was a really big slope leading up to it, and it was a big iron gate. He started to pound on it, and then someone came and opened it and asked him what he wanted. Yes, he needed to talk to Old Erik. Oh, OK, and then the gate was opened just enough for him to go through and he got in. Please come in. When he gets in, someone comes up to him, he figured that it was Old Erik. Good day, he says, it is me that they call Old Erik, what is your errand? -- I am to greet you from the manor lord and ask for a daler. -- You can have that but it costs two souls. -- I don't care what it costs, because it isn't me who is to pay. -- OK, you can sit down, it will be done soon. But Hans remembered what he'd been told, and he wouldn't sit. So he stood and looked around, and as far as he could see, the room was so long. There were these devils standing there smithing, he couldn't figure anything else out. A little while later Old Erik comes and hands him a daler and says, Here you are, -- Yes, put it down on the floor a bit, it needs to cool off, it&#x2019;s quite hot. After he thought it had lain a while, he took it and put it in his pocket. Yes, now I'd like the door opened. Sure, that was possible, and the gate was opened and Hans took a huge jump out, and the gate was slammed so hard that it echoed. Then he heard someone shout after him: You don't have your wisdom from yourself, otherwise we'd have gotten you. But Hans didn't worry about that, he kept walking. After he's gone a little bit, he notices that the ball has started rolling ahead of him again, and it kept going until it came to the hermit's cave. I should go in there and thank him for the good information. He lay there and was dead. So for his help Hans took him and buried him, since he thought he'd earned it, and after that he went home to the manor farm. When he gets closer to it, the bailiff comes out and sees him and he goes back as fast as he knows how. Well, now we have Hans again. What do we have says the manor lord, and out of sheer nervousness and fright for Hans he jumps down into the well, and dies there and when his wife hears that, she gets  hold of a rope and hangs herself. When Hans comes in through the gate, he meets Old Erik, who says: Yes, now I'm taking what is mine, Hans, now you can take what's left. In that way Hans became a manor lord.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Der var en gammel Mand, han gik omkring og tiggede, som Skik og Brug var i gamle Dage. Saa kommer han ind et Sted, og der havde de ikke andet, end de giver ham et v&#xE6;ldig stort Gaase&#xE6;g. Saa tager han jo det og gaar hans Vej. Nu tykte han, det var rart at faa det &#xC6;g ruget ud, og det maatte han Vist selv kunne gj&#xF8;re. "Nu har a tigget nok sammen for lange Tider, a kan sku godt taale at ligge og hvile mig, imens a faar det bes&#xF8;rget." Naa, saa laa han jo hans Tid, og der kom da ogsaa noget ud af det, og det blev en Dreng. Manden var ikke saa meget stolt af dether, men der var jo ikke andet for, end han skulde n&#xF8;des til at s&#xF8;rge for at holde Liv i Drengen. Det var da ogsaa &#xE9;n, der var nogen Trivning i, og han trak godt fra, saa det varede ikke l&#xE6;nge, inden han kunde b&#xE6;re baade det, han kunde selv tigge, og det, den gamle kunde tigge ogsaa. Naa, denher gamle Mand han S&#xF8;rgede omsider for at faa Drengen d&#xF8;bt og lod ham kalde Hans, for saadan hed han selv, og saa tykte han, han vilde kaldes op, ellers blev det vel aldrig gjort. Endelig omsider, da Drengen var vogset noget til, fik han ham da sat i Tjeneste ved en Bonde, og han skulde passe Gj&#xE6;ssene. Men det kunde ikke gaa, for han omgikkes dem ikke lempelig og slog de fleste af dem ihjel. Saa kom han af Tjenesten, og saa havde den gamle ham igjen. Han siger saa til ham: "Du skal op at tjene ved Herremanden, han er nu ellers saa brysk, og saa kan han komme til at t&#xE6;rske paa dig." Han gaar saa op til Herremanden med Kn&#xE6;gten og siger saadan og saadan, han kunde ingen Steder have ham, "og I maa v&#xE6;re saa god at tage ham." Ja, Herremanden var jo glad ved ham, for han kunde ingen Folk have, de blev jaget v&#xE6;k, lige saa saare de snart var komne; men denher Kn&#xE6;gt kunde han gj&#xF8;re ved, ligesom han vilde. Han kommer i Tjenesten en Helligdag om Eftermiddagen, og da Skulde der jo ikke bestilles noget. Saa fik han hans Kvarter anvist ude i en Seng ved de andre Karle, og anden Dags Morgen de kommer ind til Davre, kommer Herremanden og skal til at anvise ham hans Arbejde: han skal ud at t&#xE6;rske, for det var sidst om H&#xF8;sten. Han kommer ogsaa ud i Laden, men det kunde ikke blive til noget med hans plejlt&#xF8;j, for det var altfor smaat, og han gaar ind og klager over dether. "Ja, saa kan du jo selv lave dig noget," siger Herremanden. Hans stod og tarsk i Hovladen, hvor der var langt op til M&#xF8;nnen, saa der var ellers god plads, og saa gaar han hen til et bitte Hus, de havde, og river et Kobbel Sp&#xE6;nder af og giver sig til at knokle paa Kornet med det. Da han har saa torsken en 3 Dags Tid, tykte Herremanden at Dyngen var stor nok, og saa siger han: "Men hvordan skal vi faa den Dynge Korn gjort ren, bitte Hans?" &#x2014; "Det bliver min Sag," svarte han nok saa profos, "a skal nok bes&#xF8;rge det." Saa slaar han alle V&#xE6;ggene ud af Laden og skovler Dyngen op i en Tip, og der s&#xE6;tter han sig oppe i Tippen og bl&#xE6;ser med Enden ned i Dyngen, saa Avnerne styver til alle Verdens Hj&#xF8;rner. Derefter gaar han ind og m&#xE6;lder, te nu er Kornet f&#xE6;rdigt. Herremanden beder ham saa om at b&#xE6;re det op paa Loftet i Salsen. "Ja, saa skulde a jo have nogle S&#xE6;kke at b&#xE6;re det op i." Ja, her var S&#xE6;kke. "Er det saadan nogle Stumper, a skal b&#xE6;re Kornet i!" siger Hans, og saa gaar han ud og faar fat i et Par D&#xE6;kkener eller tre, og dem syer han Sammen, saa der bliver en stor rummelig Pose. Den &#xF8;ser han fuld af Korn, og saa faar han den paa Nakken og rejser af med den. Men D&#xF8;ren var for smal, og han river den da ud og gj&#xF8;r saadan Aabning, at han kan komme ind. Saa smider han S&#xE6;kken op paa Loftet og hen over deres allerp&#xE6;neste Stuer, te den faldt igjennem og faldt ned og Spolerede dem alt deres Boskab.
     Nu blev Herremanden lige godt r&#xE6;d for ham. "Nu er det ikke v&#xE6;rd at bestille mere i Dag," siger han, "nu kan du hvile dig til i Morgen. Da skal de andre Karle i Skoven at skove og have Vinterbr&#xE6;ndselet kj&#xF8;rt hjem, og saa kan du f&#xF8;lge  med," for her t&#xE6;nkte han, det gjaldt mere om Beh&#xE6;ndighed end om Kr&#xE6;fter, og saa fik han vel andet at studere paa. Om Morgenen rejste de andre Karle dem i god Tid, for det var seje Veje, vi havde den Tid, og det kneb med at faa et L&#xE6;s Br&#xE6;ndsel skovet og kj&#xF8;rt hjem til Aften. Saa siger de: "Nu vil vi ikke kalde paa Hans!" for han var altid saa tidlig f&#xE6;rdig med hans Arbejde, og nu havde de overlagt, at han skulde v&#xE6;re den sidste i Dag. Saa kj&#xF8;rte de til Skovs, og da det var bleven lidt op ad Dagen, rejser Hans sig og faar hans Davre. Han faar saa T&#xF8;jet paa B&#xE6;sterne og kommer af Sted ud efter de andre. Da han kommer ind ad Skoven, siger han: "Ja, bitte Karle, I t&#xE6;nker, I skal narre mig, men det skal nu ikke gaa saadan til, som I forestiller jer," og saa gaar han hen og rykker en hel Hoven Tr&#xE6;er op og l&#xE6;gger tv&#xE6;rt over Vejen bag ved sig. Saa kj&#xF8;rer han fort, og da han kommer noget l&#xE6;ngere ind, saa m&#xF8;des han med de andre, de havde allerede faaet l&#xE6;sset og skulde til at hjem. Saa sagde de til ham: "Ja, du faar jo at tr&#xF8;ste dig med, at det er maanelyst, saa du kan sagt redde dig hjem i Aften." Men Hans lod dem spotte, og saa kj&#xF8;rte han. Han fik l&#xE6;sset i en Haandevending og kom afsted tilbage. Der stod de endnu og asnede og sled for at faa deher Tr&#xE6;er af Vejen, og kunde ikke komme frem med deres B&#xE6;ster. Hans han sp&#xE6;nder hans B&#xE6;ster fra Vognen, tr&#xE6;kker dem uden om og lader dem staa forved Tr&#xE6;erne, gaar saa om efter Vognen og L&#xE6;sset og b&#xE6;rer det om til B&#xE6;sterne, sp&#xE6;nder saa for igjen og kj&#xF8;rer Hjem. Nu havde han lige godt faaet l&#xE6;sset for haardt, for da han kj&#xF8;rer ind gjennem Porten, kj&#xF8;rer han L&#xE6;sset fast der. Men saa t&#xE6;nker han: "Nu har du jo faaet det under Tag, lad det saa staa," og han sp&#xE6;nder fra og gaar ind og faar hans N&#xE6;tter. "Naa, kommer de andre snart?" siger Herremanden. "Ja, det kan ikke vare l&#xE6;nge," siger Hans. De andre maatte lade deres Vogne og Heste blive ude den Nat, for der var ikke andre Indgang paa Gaarden end gjennem Porten, og den var jo sp&#xE6;rret.
     Hans vilde gj&#xE6;rne ligge lidt l&#xE6;nge om Morgenen, og anden Dagen var Folkene som s&#xE6;dvanlig noget tidlig paa Benene, skj&#xF8;ndt de ikke havde faaet megen S&#xF8;vn den Nat. Saa siger Herremanden til dem: "Vi skal have den Karl kv&#xE6;ld, heller ogsaa kv&#xE6;ler han os." Det var de ogsaa godt enige med ham om, men nu var det om, hvordan de skulde komme afsted med det. "Ja, det skal vi komme nemt afsted med," siger Herremanden, "for n&#xE6;renstid han kommer nu op, saa lader vi ham gaa ned og rydde Kjelden, og saa har vi en gammel M&#xF8;llesten, der ligger der henne, den trimler vi ned paa ham, saadan af Vanvare, saa skal det nok gaa saadan, han faar Lov til at blive der nede." Naa, da Hans kommer op, saa siger Herremanden til ham: "H&#xF8;r, Hans, Vandet er blevet galt i Kjelden, du kunde vel ikke gaa ned og rydde den. De andre Karle kan hj&#xE6;lpe dig og tr&#xE6;kke T&#xF8;jet op." Jo, det var der intet i Vejen for. Han gaar ned og begynder at grave op, og de andre hejser op i Spanden. Da de har faa faaet Kjelden saadan omtrent ryddet, havde de faaet den M&#xF8;llesten lagt saadan, at de kunde nemt pirre den derned, men havde lige godt det Uheld, at Stenen gik ned ved Siden af ham, uden at komme til at slaa ham. Saa m&#xE6;rkede han jo godt, det var galt, og saa tog han fat i &#xD8;jet paa Stenen og tog den under Armen og assenserede op med den. Saa siger han til dem, da han kom op: "N&#xE6;renstid I vil slaa Folk den i Hovedet, saa skal I tage bedre Sigte, end I gjorde denher Gang." Hvad de var ikke r&#xE6;dde, saa blev de det nu.
     "Ja," siger Herremanden, "du kommer til ikke at tage det fortrydeligt op, for det Skete af Vanvare, der kom &#xE9;n til at tr&#xE6;de paa den. Kunde du nu ikke have gjort mig den Tjeneste, at gaa til Hellede og hente en Daler til mig. A har h&#xF8;rt sige af de penge, der kommer derfra, de skal v&#xE6;re saa dr&#xF8;je." &#x2014; "Jo, det kan a nok, men hvordan skal a b&#xE6;re mig ad med at sp&#xF8;rge Vej dertil." &#x2014; "Det kan du sagt, for du beh&#xF8;ver blot at sp&#xF8;rge dem, du kommer til, hvor Gamle-Erik boer, saa v&#xE9;d de nok det, for han hedder Gamle-Erik, der regjerer i Hellede."
     Naa, saa fik Hans sig jo en Tv&#xE6;rs&#xE6;k standet, og han kommer paa Vandring. Da han har saa gaaet et St&#xF8;d og spurgt flere om Vej &#x2014; men der var naturligvis ingen, der kunde vise ham den, saa kommer han ind i en v&#xE6;ldig stor Skov, og der kommer han til en Eremit eller saadan en &#xE9;n, og ham sp&#xF8;rger han jo da ogsaa, om han kunde ikke Sige ham, hvor Gamle-Erik han boede. "Jo," siger han, "det kan a godt, for a har vist mange Mennesker dertil, men der er aldrig &#xE9;n kommen tilbage. Men hvad vil du der?" Ja, saa fortalte han ham jo hans &#xC6;rende, og han vilde nok dertil, saa Snart ske kunde. "Ja, det er der ikke noget i Vejen for, nu skal a s&#xE6;tte en Kugle i Gang, og saa bliver den ved, til den kommer til Porten, saa stopper den. Du f&#xF8;lger jo efter den, men saa er der tre Ting, du maa passe paa. De vil nu byde dig, du skal sidde ned, naar du kommer derind, men det maa du ikke. Saa vil han fly dig Daleren i Haanden, men du maa heller ikke det, du kan blot sige til ham: Aa, l&#xE6;g den paa Gulvet, den kan svales lidt. Naar den har ligget der en lidt, saa kan du tage den. Og endelig maa du passe, naar du tr&#xE6;der ud af Hellede, at du ikke tr&#xE6;der paa D&#xF8;rtr&#xE6;et, du skal tage det ud af &#xE9;t Spring, for ellers faar du F&#xF8;dderne slaaet i Stykker. Kan du passe paa de tre Ting og komme godt fra dem, se saa er a forl&#xF8;st, og du er frelst for den Gang. Rejs saa i Guds Navn," siger den gamle Mand, og saa satte han Kuglen i Gang, og den gav sig til at l&#xF8;be, men l&#xF8;b ikke st&#xE6;rkere, end at Hans kunde f&#xF8;lge den i Skridtgang. Det var saadan j&#xE6;vn Vej, han havde at gaa, og det tr&#xE6;llede jo ikke.
    Omsider standser Kuglen for en stor Port. Der var en v&#xE6;ldig stor Skraaning op til den, og det var en stor J&#xE6;rnport. Den gav Hans sig til at hamre paa, og saa kom der &#xE9;n og lukkede op og spurgte om, hvad han vilde. Ja, han skulde snakke med Gamle-Erik. Naa ja, saa blev Porten lukket op, saa han kunde lige gaa igjennem, og saadan kom han ind. "V&#xE6;rsgod og kom indenfor," siger &#xE9;n til ham. Da han nu triner videre frem, kommer der ogsaa &#xE9;n, det var Gamle-Erik, gjorde han da Regning paa. "Goddag," siger han saa, "det er mig, de kalder Gamle-Erik, hvad er dit &#xC6;rende?" &#x2014; "Det er, a skulde hilse fra Herremanden og bede om en Daler." &#x2014; "Den kan du ogsaa faa," siger Gamle-Erik, "men den koster to Sj&#xE6;le." &#x2014; "Ja, det er mig lige meget, hvad den koster, for det er ikke mig, der skal betale den." &#x2014; "Ja, nu kan du s&#xE6;tte dig, saa skal den strags v&#xE6;re f&#xE6;rdig." Men Hans huskede jo paa Buddet, han havde faaet, og han vilde ikke sidde. Saa stod han og saa sig om, og saa langt han kunde se, der var saadan et langt Rum, og der stod deher Dj&#xE6;vle og smedede, han kunde da ikke blive klog paa andet. Omsider kommer Gamle-Erik og flyer ham Daleren og siger: "V&#xE6;rsgod, her er den." &#x2014; "Ja, l&#xE6;g den lidt paa Gulvet, den kan svales," siger Hans, "den er vel varm at tage ved." Da den havde ligget lidt, som han tykte, saa tog han den og put den i Lommen. "Ja, saa vilde a godt have lukket op," siger han, "for nu skal a te'en." Jo, det kunde godt lade sig gj&#xF8;re, og Porten blev lukket op. Hans tog saa et v&#xE6;ldigt Spring ud, og Porten blev hugget i lige te det rungede. Saa h&#xF8;rte han &#xE9;n, der raabte efter ham: "Ja, din Klogskab har du ikke af dig selv, ellers skulde vi sku nok have fanget dig." Men det br&#xF8;d Hans sig ikke om, han blev ved at gaa.
     Da han er kommen lidt hen, ser han, at Kuglen er kommen til at l&#xF8;be forved ham igjen, og den blev ved, indtil den kom til Eremitens Hus. "Da skal a ind," siger Hans til sig selv, "og sige ham Tak for god Underretning." Men da laa han og var d&#xF8;d. Saa for udvist Tjeneste tog Hans ham og begravet ham, han tykte, han havde fortjent det, og derefter gik han hjem til Herregaarden. Da han kommer der i N&#xE6;rheden, saa kommer Ridefogden ud og faaer ham at se, og han tilbage, det villeste han har l&#xE6;rt. "Saa, nu har vi sku Hans igjen," raaber han. "Hvad har vi!" siger Herremanden, og af ene Forfippelse og R&#xE6;dsel for Hans saa springer han ned i Kjelden og kommer af Dage der. Da hans Kone h&#xF8;rer det, saa faar hun fat i en Strikke og gaar hen og h&#xE6;nger sig. Da Hans saa kommer ind ad Porten, saa kommer han der imod Gamle-Erik, der siger: "Ja, nu tager a, hvad mit er; nu kan du, Hans, tage det, der er tilbage." Det gjorde Hans ogsaa, og paa den Maade blev han Herremand.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was an old man, he went about begging as was the custom in the old days. So he goes in to one place and they didn&#x2019;t have anything for him except for a very large goose egg. So he takes it and goes his way. Now he thought that it would be nice to get that egg hatched, and he figured he could probably do it himself. &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;ve begged for a long time, so I can certainly handle lying and resting while I take care of this.&#x201D; Well, then he lay for a while, and something came of it, and it turned out to be a boy. The man wasn&#x2019;t terribly proud of this, but there was nothing else to do but to make sure that the boy stayed alive. The boy was someone who really wanted to thrive, and he ate quite a bit, and so it wasn&#x2019;t long before he could carry both everything that he could beg and everything that the old man could beg as well. 
     Well, at some point this here old man made sure that the boy was baptized and had him named Hans, because that&#x2019;s what he was called himself, and so he thought he wanted to have someone named after him, otherwise it would never happen. Finally, when the boy had grown up some, he got him work with a farmer, and he was to take care of the geese. But that didn&#x2019;t work out because he didn&#x2019;t treat them gently and he killed most of them. Then he lost his job, and so the old man had him once again. 
     He says to him, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re to go up and work for the manor lord, he is quite brusque, and he might go as far as to thrash you.&#x201D; He goes up to the manor lord with the lad and says such and such, he couldn&#x2019;t get him work anywhere, &#x201C;and would you please take him.&#x201D; Yes, the manor lord was quite happy to take him, because nobody else would stay there, he chased them away as soon as they came; but he could do as he pleased with this lad.
     The boy starts work one holiday in the afternoon, and so there wasn&#x2019;t anything to do then. So he was shown his lodgings, a bed out by the other farmhands, and the next morning when they&#x2019;ve come in for breakfast, the manor lord comes in to show him his work: he is to go and thresh, because it was at the end of the harvest. 
     He goes out to the barn too, but he couldn&#x2019;t do anything with his flail, since it was far too small, and he goes in and complains about this. &#x201C;OK, you can go ahead and make one for yourself,&#x201D; says the manor lord. Hans stood threshing there in the barn where it was quite high to the roof peak, and so there was lots of space, and so then he goes over to a little house they had, and tears a bunch of roof beams off and begins to thresh the grain with that. After he has threshed for three days, the manor lord felt that the pile was big enough, and then he says: &#x201C;But how are we going to clean that pile of grain, little Hans?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;That&#x2019;ll be my business,&#x201D; he answered quite arrogantly, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll take care of it.&#x201D; Then he knocks out all the walls in the barn and shovels the whole pile up to a point, and he climbs up on top and he blows with his behind down into the pile so that the chaff is blown to all the world&#x2019;s corners. After that he goes in and says that the grain is done. The manor lord then asks him to carry it up into the attic of the main house. &#x201C;Sure, but I&#x2019;ll need some sacks to carry it up in.&#x201D; Sure, here were some sacks. &#x201C;Is it little scraps like this that I&#x2019;m to carry the grain in?&#x201D; Hans says, and then he goes out and gets hold of a couple of horse blankets or three and he sews them together, so it becomes a big roomy bag. He fills it with grain and then he puts it on his shoulders and goes off with it. But the door was too narrow, and he rips it out and makes such an opening that he could go in. Then he throws the sack up in the attic and over their nicest rooms, and then it fell through and fell down and ruined all their furnishings. 
     Now the manor lord got scared of him. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to do any more today,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;you can rest until tomorrow. The other farmhands are going to go out to the forest then and cut and drive the winter firewood home, and you can go along with them,&#x201D; because he thought that that was more about cleverness than strength, and then he&#x2019;d have other things to think about. The next morning the other farmhands got up in good time, because it was rough roads we had back then, and it was hard to get a load of firewood loaded and driven home by nightfall. Then they say, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to call for Hans!&#x201D; because he always finished his work early, and now they&#x2019;d decided that he&#x2019;d be the last one today. So they drove out to the forest, and when it was later in the day, Hans gets up and has his breakfast. He then hitches up the horses and sets off after the others. When he gets to the forest, he says, &#x201C;Yes, you little guys, you think you&#x2019;re going to fool me, but it isn&#x2019;t going to go the way you think,&#x201D; and then he goes over and pulls up a whole bunch of trees and lays them across the road behind himself. Then he drives quickly, and when he gets a little farther in, he meets up with the other farmhands, they had already loaded up and were ready to head home. Then they said to him, &#x201C;Well, you&#x2019;ll have to comfort yourself with the fact that the moon is shining, you can certainly find your way home tonight.&#x201D; But Hans let them mock him, and then he drove off. He got loaded up in a jiffy and headed back. They were still standing there and were toiling away to get these trees off the road, and they couldn&#x2019;t get around them with their horses. Hans unhitches his horses from the wagon, leads them around, and lets them stand in front of the trees, goes back around for the wagon and its load, and carries them around to the horses, hitches up again and drives home. Now he&#x2019;d overloaded his wagon and when he drives in the farm gates, the load gets stuck there. But then he thinks, &#x201C;Now you&#x2019;ve got it under roof, let it stand there,&#x201D; so he unhitches his horses and goes in and has his dinner. &#x201C;Oh, are the others coming soon?&#x201D; says the manor lord. &#x201C;Yes, it won&#x2019;t be long,&#x201D; says Hans. The others had to let their loads and their horses stay outside that night, because there was no other entrance to the farm than through the gate, and it was blocked.
     Hans wanted to stay in bed a little bit longer in the morning, and the next day the people were on their feet early as usual, even though they hadn&#x2019;t gotten any sleep that night. Then the manor lord says to them, &#x201C;We need to kill that guy, or he&#x2019;ll wind up killing us.&#x201D; They were all in agreement, but now the question was how they were going to get rid of him. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll get rid of him easily,&#x201D; says the manor lord, &#x201C;because as soon as he gets up, we&#x2019;ll have him go down and clean the well, and we have an old millstone lying out there, we&#x2019;ll tumble it down on top of him, you know, by accident, and then he&#x2019;ll be allowed to stay down there.&#x201D; Well, Hans gets up, and the manor lord says to him, &#x201C;Listen, Hans, the water has gone wrong in the well, could you go down and clean it out. The other farmhands can help you and pull the mud up.&#x201D; Sure, there was nothing in the way of doing that. He goes down and begins to dig, and the others haul it up in the bucket. When they&#x2019;ve just about cleared out the well, they&#x2019;d gotten the millstone positioned so that they could easily tickle it down on top of him, but they had the misfortune that the stone landed next to him without hitting him. Then Hans realized that things were wrong and so he grabbed hold of the eye of the stone and put it under his arm and climbed up with it. Then he says to them when he comes up: &#x201C;The next time you want to hit people in the head, you should take better aim than you did this time.&#x201D; If they weren&#x2019;t scared before, they were now.
     &#x201C;OK,&#x201D; says the manor lord, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t be so annoyed, it happened by accident, someone stepped on it. Could you do me a favor and go to hell and get me a daler? I&#x2019;ve heard said that the money that comes from there is supposed to go a long way.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Sure, I can do that, but how am I supposed to go about asking directions.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;You can do that, because all you need to do is ask people you meet where Old Erik lives, they&#x2019;ll know, because the one who rules Hell is called Old Erik.&#x201D;
     Well, then Hans gets a knapsack and he sets off on his journey. After he has gone a while and asked many people the way &#x2013; but of course there was no one who could show him the way &#x2013; he comes to a really big forest, and he comes to a hermit or one like that, and he asks him as well, if he could tell him where Old Erik lived. &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;I certainly can, because I&#x2019;ve shown many people there, but not a one has ever come back. But what do you want there?&#x201D; Well, then he told him his errand, and he wanted to go there as quickly as possible. &#x201C;Yes, there&#x2019;s nothing in the way of that, and I&#x2019;m going to set a ball rolling, and it will keep going until it gets to the gate, and then it will stop. You&#x2019;re to follow it, but there are three things that you should watch out for. They&#x2019;ll ask you to sit down when you get in there, but you mustn&#x2019;t do that. Then he&#x2019;ll give you the daler in your hand, but you mustn&#x2019;t let him do that, you can simply say: Oh, please put it on the floor, it needs to cool down a bit. When it has lain for a bit, then you can take it. And finally, you need to watch out when you leave hell, that you don&#x2019;t step on the threshold, you need to do it in one jump, otherwise your feet will be broken. If you can watch out for those three things and get past them well, then I&#x2019;ll be released from a curse, and you&#x2019;ll be saved this time. Go now in the name of God,&#x201D; says the old man, and then he set the ball rolling, and it started rolling, but it didn&#x2019;t roll any faster than Hans could follow along walking. It was a very even road he was to walk, and there was nothing to hinder him. 
     After a while, the ball stops in front of a large gate. There was a real slope leading up to it, and it was a big iron gate. Hans started to pound on it, and then someone came and opened it and asked him what he wanted. Yes, he needed to talk to Old Erik. Oh, OK, and then the gate was opened just enough for him to go through and that&#x2019;s how he got in. &#x201C;Please come in,&#x201D; someone says to him. As he goes farther along, someone comes up to him, he figured that it was Old Erik. &#x201C;Good day,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;it is me that they call Old Erik, what is your errand?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;I am to greet you from the manor lord and ask for a daler.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;You can have that,&#x201D; says Old Erik, &#x201C;but it costs two souls.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care what it costs, because it isn&#x2019;t me who is going to pay.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;OK, you can sit down, it will be done soon.&#x201D; But Hans remembered what he&#x2019;d been told, and he wouldn&#x2019;t sit. So he stood and looked around, and as far as he could see, the room was so long, there were these devils standing there smithing, he couldn&#x2019;t figure anything else out. A little while later Old Erik comes and hands him a daler and says, &#x201C;Here you are,&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Yes, put it down on the floor a bit, it needs to cool off,&#x201D; says Hans, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s too hot to hold.&#x201D; After he thought it had lain a while, he took it and put it in his pocket. &#x201C;Yes, now I&#x2019;d like the door opened,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;because now I need to go back to someone.&#x201D; Sure, that was possible, and the gate was opened. Hans took a huge jump out, and the gate was slammed shut so hard behind him that it echoed. Then he heard someone shout after him: &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have your wisdom from yourself, otherwise we&#x2019;d have gotten you.&#x201D; But Hans didn&#x2019;t worry about that, he kept walking. 
     After he&#x2019;s gone a little bit, he notices that the ball has started rolling ahead of him again, and it kept going until it came to the hermit&#x2019;s house. &#x201C;I should go in there,&#x201D; says Hans to himself, &#x201C;and thank him for the good information.&#x201D; But then the hermit lay there dead. So for his help Hans took him and buried him, since he thought he&#x2019;d earned it, and after that he went home to the manor farm. When he gets closer to it, the bailiff comes out and sees him and he goes back as fast as he knows how. &#x201C;Well, now we have Hans again,&#x201D; he shouts. &#x201C;What do we have?&#x201D; says the manor lord, and out of sheer nervousness and fright for Hans he jumps down into the well and dies there. When his wife hears that, she gets hold of a rope and hangs herself. When Hans comes in through the gate, he meets Old Erik, who says: &#x201C;Yes, now I&#x2019;m taking what is mine; now you, Hans, can take what&#x2019;s left." Hans did that too, and in that way he became a manor lord.</english_publication>

    <annotation>Peder is fascinated by conflict and the ability of the little guy to triumph over the powerful. Here, the postal carrier is a representative of the Crown, and presumably sees himself above the law. The tension between the desire for local control and the role of the central administration (first the Crown and then the state) were constant, and informed a great deal of the debate over legislation concerning local rights through the latter half of the nineteenth century. 

     One of the main forms of public transportation in Denmark, prior to the development of the railway system in the 1860s, was the system of postal wagons. In fact, carrying passengers was as much a part of the postal service as carrying mail (Hvidt and Olsen 1990, vol. 11). 

     The district bailiff, reluctant at first, finally comes to the help of the local man. The willingness to let bygones be bygones might well be related to the tension that existed between the local government and the distant central authority of the Crown. The final scene in the restaurant where the two plaintiffs wind up paying for the defendant's lunch is reminiscent of one of Peder's earlier stories, in which the young farmhand tricks his antagonists (PJ 2.27).

     Bremerholm in Copenhagen was a forced labor institution, originally a ship wharf, with the first prisoners sent there in the 1570s. According to Christian V's Danish law of 1683, the man from Bukballe would have been subject to Book 6 Chapter 4 Article 16 of the criminal code, which states, "Overfalder nogen sin af Kongen forordnet &#xD8;vrighed i deris Embede, straffis paa &#xC6;re, eller Boeslod, efter Sagens Beskaffenhed" (If anyone assaults any of the king's officials who are carrying out their duties, the punishment is either fine or imprisonment depending on the severity of the offense). The statute allows for a great degree of latitude. Punishment at Bremerholm, where one worked in irons, was generally considered "the last possible punishment," and three years at Bremerholm would have been a considerable punishment. Interestingly, many of the statutes of Christian V's law were in effect up through the 1860s, and some still echo in contemporary Danish law. 

     Frederik VI (1768-1839) became king of Denmark in 1808. It was during his reign that Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden in 1814.</annotation>

    <english_manuscript>Over on Grumstrup Mark in Vedslet parish lies Hede M&#xF8;lle. It was owned in its time by a district bailiff, who was in charge of Hads district. The river formed the boundary between the districts, and he had to build himself a house on the Hads side of the river to be in his jurisdiction, while the mill itself lay in another. He knew so much about the law that people often sought him out to solve disputes, particularly poor people. At that time, the royal post drove between Horsens and Aarhus, past Vedslet Kirke. There was this man up on Baastrup Mark, who lived at a farm called Bukballe, and he had to go to Aarhus. He goes out and wanted to come up and ride with this postal carrier. But the postal carrier was a moody fellow, and the two must have had a bit of an argument. So the other one has to walk behind but stays close to the wagon anyway so when the guy drives into the farm courtyard, and unhitches the horses, the man comes up, knocks one of the bridles out of his hands, and beats him silly in front of witnesses. It was a dangerous thing to do to lay a hand on the Royal Post, and he was naturally reported and had to go and defend himself in court. The least punishment he could get off with was to spend three years at Bremerholm, and he might even have to spend the rest of his life there. They asked all the wise legal minds both in Aarhus and in Horsens, but nobody dared help him. Then there was a man who lived down here in the forest, who was called Jep, he went up to him and said, &#x201C;Have you gone over to the guy at Hede M&#xF8;lle and asked his advice?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;No, I haven't, because I threatened him last year.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, I'll try going over there and see what there is to do about this.&#x201D; So he went over there. &#x201C;Well, if it had been anybody else but I don't think I want to help him, because he showed himself to be not so nice last year.&#x201D; This man persists and finally he says, &#x201C;Well, you can come down here tomorrow night, then I'll give you an answer.&#x201D; He left. &#x201C;Well, things aren't too bad, you can tell him that he should show up at next assembly day in Horsens, and he can bring a couple of men with him, if he wants.&#x201D; So they meet too, and they go into a bar. &#x201C;You can eat and drink what you want, we'll get it paid for.&#x201D; He had two men along with him himself. Then he left, and came back a little later with the postmaster and the town bailiff. Then he says to the man, &#x201C;Here are the two men who have charged you, and you can go now. Whatever you've eaten, will be paid for by these two men.&#x201D; Then that court affair was done with. Jep went down to the district bailiff later and said, &#x201C;How did that happen, that you could save the man, without having to go to court or to the assembly?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, I'll tell you. They'd also broken the law. I had two men hide over by Vedslet church and watch when the post came, and all of a sudden, the day after you'd visited me, there was a royal sign on the wagon and so they had to yield.&#x201D; This happened during the time of Frederik the Sixth.</english_manuscript>
    <danish_publication>Omme paa Grumstrup Mark i Vedslet Sogn ligger Hede M&#xF8;lle. Den ejedes i sin Tid af en Herredsfoged, der var over Hads Herred. Aaen gj&#xF8;r Skjel imellem Herrederne, og han maatte bygge sig et Hus til Beboelse paa Hads Herredssiden af Aaen for at v&#xE6;re i sin Jurisdiktion, medens M&#xF8;llen selv laa i Hjelmslev Herred. Samme Herredsfoged var saa lovkyndig, at mange s&#xF8;gte til ham i Tr&#xE6;ttesager, og is&#xE6;r var det fattige Folk. Den Tid gik der kongelig kj&#xF8;rende Post fra Horsens til Aarhus, og den skulde om ad Vedslet Kirke. Saa var der en Mand oppe paa Baastrup Mark i en Gaard, som hedder Bukballe, og han skal en Dag til Aarhus. Saa gaar han nu landvejs, men da Posten kommer i det samme, forlanger han at vil op at kj&#xF8;re med denher Post. Men Postkarlen var en but Krabat, og de to havde vist et bitte Mellemv&#xE6;rende, nok er det, han kj&#xF8;rer fra ham, og den anden maa gaa bag efter Vognen til Aarhus. Han gaar rask til og holder sig saa n&#xE6;r ved Vognen alligevel, at da Kusken kj&#xF8;rer ind i Gaarden og sp&#xE6;nder fra, kommer Manden og rykker det ene Hovedlag ud af hans H&#xE6;nder og gjennemtamper ham med det i Vidners Paasyn. Det var jo en farlig Sag at l&#xE6;gge Haand paa en kongelig Post, og selvf&#xF8;lgelig blev han m&#xE6;ldt og skulde m&#xF8;de for Retten.

Denher Mand bliver ved, og til sidst siger han: "Ja nu kan du komme herned i Morgen Aften, saa skal a give dig Besked." Han gik ogsaa. "Ja, Sagerne staar ikke saa meget ringe," siger Herredsfogden, "du kan sige Manden, te a skal m&#xF8;de for ham n&#xE6;ste Tingdag i Horsens, og han kan tage et Par M&#xE6;nd med, om han det tykkes." Saa m&#xF8;der de ogsaa, og de gik ind paa et V&#xE6;rtshus. Herredsfogden havde selv to Mand med. "Nu kan I blot spise og drikke og tage for jer af Sagerne, vi skal nok faa det betalt." Dermed gik han, men en Tid efter kom han tilbage med Postmesteren og Byfogden. Saa siger han til Manden, der var anklaget: "Her er de to M&#xE6;nd, der har klaget dig an, og nu kan du gaa, for nu er du fri. "Hvad I har fort&#xE6;rt," siger han saa til alle de andre, "det betaler de to Herrer." Saa var den Rettergang til Side. Jep gik siden ned til Herredsfogden og sagde: "Hvordan kunde det gaa til, at De kunde saadan frelse Manden, uden at komme for Retten eller nogen Ting?" &#x2014; "Det kunde a sagt, de havde ogsaa forbrudt dem. A havde to M&#xE6;nd til at ligge ovre ved Vedslet Kirke og passe paa, naar Posten kom, og nyssen Dagen efter, at du havde v&#xE6;ret ved mig, kom der kongeligt Skilt paa Vognen. Det havde ikke v&#xE6;ret der f&#xF8;r, og derfor maatte de give dem." Dether foregik under Frederik den Sjette.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Hede Mill lies over on Grumstrup Mark in Vedslet parish. It was owned in its time by a district bailiff, who was in charge of Hads district. The river is the boundary between the districts, and he had to build his house on the Hads district side of the river to remain in his jurisdiction, while the mill itself lay in Hjelmslev district. This same district bailiff knew so much about the law that people often sought him out to solve disputes, particularly poor people. At that time, the royal post was driven between Horsens and Aarhus, and it was supposed to go past Vedslet church. Then there was this man at a farm up on Baastrup Mark, which was called Bukballe, and he was going to go to Aarhus one day. So he goes down to the main road, but since the postal carrier comes by at the same time, he asks this postal carrier for a ride. But the postal carrier was a moody fellow, and the two must have had a bit of an argument, enough said, so he drives off, and the other one has to walk behind the wagon all the way to Aarhus. He walks quite quickly, and stays close to the wagon anyway, and so when the guy drives into the farm courtyard, and unhitches the horses, the man comes up, grabs one of the bridles out of his hand, and beats him silly with it in front of witnesses. It was a dangerous thing to do, to lay a hand on the Royal Post, and he was of course reported and had to go to court. The least punishment he could get off with was to spend three years at Bremerholm, and he might even have to spend the rest of his life there.
     Now they sought out all the wise people who knew about the law both in Aarhus and in Horsens, but nobody dared help him. Then there was a man who lived down here in the forest, who was called Jep, he went up to him and said, &#x201C;Have you gone over to him at Hede Mill and asked his advice?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;No, I haven&#x2019;t, because I threatened him last year.&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll try going over there and see what there is to do about this.&#x201D; So he went over there. &#x201C;Well, if it had been anybody else,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;but I don&#x2019;t think I want to help him, because he showed himself to be not so nice last year.&#x201D; This man continues and finally he says, &#x201C;Well, you can come down here tomorrow night, then I&#x2019;ll let you know.&#x201D; He left too. &#x201C;Well, things aren&#x2019;t too bad,&#x201D; says the district bailiff, &#x201C;you can tell the man that I&#x2019;ll meet up for him next assembly day in Horsens, and he can bring a couple of men with him, if he wants.&#x201D; So they meet too, and they go into a bar. The district bailiff had two men along himself. &#x201C;You can eat and drink what you want, we&#x2019;ll get it paid for.&#x201D; Then he left, but a little later he came back with the postmaster and the town bailiff. Then he says to the man who&#x2019;d been charged, &#x201C;Here are the two men who have charged you, and you can go now, because you&#x2019;re free.&#x201D; &#x201C;Whatever you&#x2019;ve eaten,&#x201D; he says to the others, &#x201C;will be paid for by these two men.&#x201D; Then that affair was done with. Jep went down to the district bailiff later and said, &#x201C;How did you manage that? How could you save the man without having to go to court or to the assembly?&#x201D; &#x2013; &#x201C;Well, I pointed out that they&#x2019;d also broken the law. I had two men hide over by Vedslet church and watch when the post came, and all of a sudden, the day after you&#x2019;d visited me, there was a royal sign on the wagon. That hadn&#x2019;t been there before, and so they had to back off.&#x201D; This happened during the time of Frederik the Sixth.</english_publication>

    <annotation>The worker's quick comeback to the criticism of his work leveled by the doctor reflects many of the tensions that existed between social classes in rural Denmark. The worker refers, of course, to the fact that the doctor's mistakes result in death--he can call on the minister to bury those mistakes in the ground.

Da han kom til Dyrehavsbakken, s&#xE5; han, at den st&#xF8;d p&#xE5; fire p&#xE6;le, og at troldene havde travlt med at dandse. Han blev holdende for at se p&#xE5; l&#xF6;jerne; men da kom der nogle af troldene ud og b&#xF8;d ham en drik i et guldb&#xE6;ger. Karlen tog imod b&#xE6;geret, men drikken kastede han bag sig og hesten, og dermed satte han af sted med b&#xE6;geret i h&#xE5;nden, alt hvad remmer og t&#xF6;j  kunde holde. Troldene fulgte efter, og de kom ham n&#xE6;rmere og n&#xE6;rmere. Han red da ind p&#xE5; marken, og det hjalp; han kunde nemlig ride tv&#xE6;rs over alle marker, men n&#xE5;r troldene kom til en agerren, s&#xE5; m&#xE5;tte de l&#xF8;be uden om. Alligevel var de karlen meget n&#xE6;r, da han kom til Boslunde, men da kastede han b&#xE6;geret ind over kirkeg&#xE5;rdsmuren, og nu l&#xE5; det p&#xE5; indviet jord, s&#xE5; kunde troldene ikke f&#xE5; det, de m&#xE5;tte da vende n&#xE6;sen om og hjem. Dagen efter viste det sig, at hesten havde flere svedne pletter p&#xE5; bagdelen, det var nogle dr&#xE5;ber af drikken, som havde voldt dette. B&#xE6;geret blev s&#xE5; ellers i lange tider brugt som alterb&#xE6;ger i Boslunde kirke.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Late one night, a farmhand from Boslunde rode from Skjelsk&#xF8;r. When he got to Dyrehavsbakke, he saw that it was standing on four posts, and the trolls were busy dancing. He stopped to watch the fun; but then some trolls came out and offered him a drink in a gold cup. The farmhand accepted the cup, but he tossed the drink behind him and the horse, and then he took off as fast as he could with the cup in his hand. The trolls ran after him, and they got closer and closer. He rode onto the fields and that helped; he could ride across the fields, but when the trolls came to a furrow, they had to run around it. Despite that, they were very close to the farmhand when he got to Boslunde, but then he threw the cup over a church wall, and now it was on consecrated ground, so the trolls couldn't get it, they had to turn their noses around and go home. The next day it turned out that the horse had numerous scorched spots on its rump, it was some drops of the drink that had done that. The cup was used for a long time as the chalice in Boslunde church.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>When I was a little boy, I often heard tell of the nightraven, but I never saw it. The men went and got heather far away, and it was often quite late before they got home. One time late at night during the summer I went past a man who was going to get heather. Then we heard a bird that came from far out to the west and swung right in over us and it said, "Baw-u-u! baw-u-u!" so it echoed in the air. Another bird came after it that had more of a peep in its voice. "What was that?" I say. "Don't worry about it," he says. "That's the nightraven." -- "I'm not worrying about it, I'm just asking about it." Later I heard the old peoples' stories, that all those who committed suicide were to be buried in a T-shaped field divide, and they could dig or push a grain of sand aside each year so that, after many years, they could come up to the surface and fly off toward the holy grave, but they could only fly a certain distance each year. It could take many hundreds of years before they reached it.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A confirmation student in Erslev went to the T&#xF8;ds&#xF8; minister. They were watering their cows at the parsonage, and she sits in the confirmation classroom and says: what would they give her to get those cows to dance. Well, she couldn't do that. Yes, she certainly could. "I can also sit in here and milk milk from the cows." No, that couldn't be done. Yes, well if she was given an awl and a bowl. Then the minister came in and the others told him what the girl had said. "Can you do that, my girl?" Then the awl is fetched and the bowl too, and then she started milking. After she had milked for a while, she didn't want to anymore, because now blood started to come. Then he wanted to know who had taught her that. It was an old woman. She had put two cat tails in the oven and when she got one more, then she'd be fully taught. Then the minister had her re-baptized and then that was over, now she couldn't do things like that anymore.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Der var en gang en skipper fra Svendborg, der sejlede til Norge. P&#xE5; en af sine rejser der over traf han en dag en lille lav mand med en bred hat p&#xE5;, som kom til ham og spurgte, hvorfra han var. "Fra Svendborg." &#x2014; "N&#xE5;, fra Svendborg, der har jeg f&#xF6;r boet." &#x2014; "Hvordan er det, du er kommen her over?" spurgte skipperen. "Jo," svarede den lille mand, "jeg boede i en lille h&#xF6;j der nede, og havde det rigtig godt, og havde s&#xE5;dan en god omgang med fire kj&#xF6;bm&#xE6;nd inde i byen, vil du hilse! men s&#xE5; kom Morten Luther, og s&#xE5; ringede det, men det kunde jeg ikke t&#xE5;le at h&#xF8;re, og s&#xE5; rejste jeg her over, og her boer jeg nu i en h&#xF6;j her straks ved." De skiltes da, skipperen kom hjem og skulde til at lede efter kj&#xF6;bm&#xE6;ndene, kunde han ikke finde dem, ej heller nogen, der hed s&#xE5;dan. S&#xE5; s&#xF6;gte han pr&#xE6;sten, og de ledte i kirkebogen og fandt, at det var tre hundrede &#xE5;r, siden disse kj&#xF6;bm&#xE6;nd havde levet.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Once there was a skipper from Svendborg who sailed to Norway. On one of his trips over there he met one day a little short man with a broad brimmed hat on who came to him and asked where he was from. &#x201C;From Svendborg.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, from Svendborg. I used to live there.&#x201D; &#x201C;How is it that you&#x2019;ve come here?&#x201D; asked the skipper. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; answered the little man, &#x201C;I lived in a little mound down there, and had it really good, and hung out with four merchants in the town; will you give them my regards? But then Morten Luther came, and then it rang, and I couldn&#x2019;t stand to listen to that, so I traveled over here, and now I live near here in a mound real close by.&#x201D; They parted then but then when the skipper came home and was to look up the merchants, he couldn&#x2019;t find them or anybody who was called that. Then he went to the minister and they looked in the parish register, and found that it was three hundred years ago that these merchants had lived.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Rongenbj&#xE6;rg i Tyrskind har min fader lagt m&#xE6;rke til nogle s&#xE6;re tilf&#xE6;lde. Flere gange, n&#xE5;r han har ligget der ude om aftenen eller tidlig om morgenen og gr&#xE6;sset med hestene, har han h&#xF8;rt kister sl&#xE5; i l&#xE5;se der inde. Med det samme har hestene sl&#xE5;et op og sprunget omkring og snoret (prustet) i t&#xF6;jrslaget. Oppe midt p&#xE5; banken grov vi mergel, og da vi kom en tre alen ind i mergelen, fandt vi en sort gang, der hverken udmundede til den ene eller den anden side, og der fandt vi en lille vedde garn i den gang. Det tykte vi var m&#xE6;rkeligt. I den banke var der udgravet store fordybninger, som Polakkerne har haft at s&#xE6;tte deres heste ind i, mens de var her.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>In Rongenbj&#xE6;rg in Tyrskind my father noticed some weird happenings. Many times when he had been lying out there at night or early in the morning grazing the horses, he heard chests being slammed shut inside it (the mound). Immediately, the horses would rear up and jump about and snort in their halters. Midways up the hill we dug for marl, we discovered a black corridor which didn&#x2019;t open out on either side, and we found a little ball of yarn in the corridor. We thought that that was weird. Deep holes had been dug in the mounds and the Poles had put their horses in them when they were here.</english_publication>

He noticed that it stood and lurked and wanted to come when he had gone to bed. Then he talked to the farmer about how bad it was and how the horses were about to waste away because of it. They&#x2019;d heard that if one threw a pail of water on it, then it would go away. So then one night he and the farmer stood there with a pail of water and when they heard it come, they threw it on the horse. Then a naked woman was standing there, &#x201C;Oh, why did you do that, I have to go over both lakes and salt water to get to my small children.&#x201D; Then they helped her get home and she didn&#x2019;t wind up going as a mare any longer.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>One time, a wealthy lord came and stayed at an inn, and the innkeepers saw that he had a lot of money in his wallet.  They couldn't bear to see that, so they got up at night and chopped him to death.Then there was a little child who went and sang, "My father and my mother have slaughtered a magnificent lord tonight, now we will have roast to eat, and sausages for lunch." The wife said to her husband, "That child will do us harm, you better go down and drown her." Then the child sang: "I'll go to school and not ask for any bread," and now he couldn't drown her. Well, then they lit the fire in the oven so they could burn her. At that moment, two horse dealers came into the inn and then the child goes over and complains to them and says, "My father wants to drown me, and my mother to burn me, won't you take me with you?" They answer: "That's just childish nonsense," since they couldn't believe that they intended to do that, since she was their only child. Then when they came down to a stream that they had to cross, they couldn't get the horses across no matter what they tried. "Let's ride up there again," they say, "maybe the child can tell us what to do." When they got up to the inn, the people had shut the doors tight, and they had to knock loudly on it. Would they give them a glass of beer? Well, the wife said she didn't have time right now, but they continued to intrude on them, it was a public inn and they wanted to come in. Then she had to open up, and there the child lay and was all burned up, and her mouth was quite black. That the innkeepers came to regret that you can pretty much imagine.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>The robbers in Hjordekjelde had bells over the road. A peddler had come to Hoved Inn and had gotten a room there. Sometime during the night, he had gone to his room when a girl came and said to him that he should leave quickly, otherwise something terrible would happen, &#x201C;and it has to be quickly, but I want to come too.&#x201D; Well, his best horse was down in the barn. She&#x2019;d get it out. She had some long stockings and she puts them on the horses hooves. As soon as they had gotten a little bit away, the dogs came after them. They let it out a bit and reached Vedslet church. Then there was a ladder up to the bell and they scrambled up that and pulled it up after them, but they had to let the horse run free. Now they had to stay there until it was daytime and people came along the road because they were surrounded by robbers. Then they escaped from that danger, and when they started out again, he took the girl with him. The innkeeper there in Hoved was in cahoots with the robbers there in Hjordekjelde of course.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>This here Rosendal from R&#xF8;dding was incredibly good at conjuring. There was a thicket near Hummelg&#xE5;rd in Krejbj&#xE6;rg, and a man walked again there. He apparently came from a manor farm that had lain not too far from there. The farm was called Kr&#xF8;geborg, and there are still some ruins from the old castle. It was horrible when that ghost came up again. Then the minister had to go over there and conjure him. The driver could feel a great unease, and heard that big words were being spoken. Then he takes a whip from the wagon and wants to go out and smack the old one with it. But he injured the minister so bad by doing that that the minister had to race the Evil One to Krejbj&#xE6;rg church. When he got there, the Evil One stuck his head up out of that little dale south and west of the church and gave a loud roar and disappeared when he saw that the minister had come first. One can still see down in the thicket where he was conjured down, there's actually a green spot there.</english_publication>

Om aftenen, da han tog hjem, havde han f&#xE5;et en dejlig stor dram og var noget hoven i det. S&#xE5; r&#xE5;ber han op til tyven: "Hvad h&#xE6;nger du der og dingler efter? det var bedre, du kom ned og s&#xE5; til mig juleaften." Han kj&#xF8;rer videre og kommer hjem i hans seng. S&#xE5; l&#xE6;gger rusen sig noget, og han siger da til konen: "A gjorde vist en fejl i aften." &#x2014; "Hvad var det?" siger hun. "Da a kj&#xF8;rte forbi den galge, r&#xE5;bte a til den d&#xF8;de, at han skulde komme ned og se til mig juleaften." &#x2014; "Ja, det skulde du ikke have gjort, nu f&#xE5;r vi at se, hvordan det g&#xE5;r." Juleaften kommer, og ganske rigtig kommer der &#xE9;n og banker p&#xE5; d&#xF6;ren. Manden beder ham velkommen, og han skal s&#xE6;tte sig op til overenden af bordet, og der blev sat for ham i stort m&#xE5;l. Det s&#xE5; ud, som han spiste, men han sank intet af det. Da han var f&#xE6;rdig, takkede han og vilde g&#xE5;. "Ja, nu vil du nok komme op og se til mig nyt&#xE5;rsaften," siger han. Manden var noget forfar over bes&#xF8;get, og han sagde straks ja. Men siden g&#xE5;r han ned til pr&#xE6;sten og vil h&#xF8;re, hvad f&#xE5;er vil sige til det, og han fort&#xE6;ller ham jo hele sammenh&#xE6;ngen. Pr&#xE6;sten r&#xE5;der ham til, at han skal sige: "A kommer i Guds navn, og a vil ogs&#xE5; g&#xE5; i Guds navn." Han stavler alts&#xE5; derop nyt&#xE5;rsaften, og da det s&#xE5; giver et klink, forvandles &#xF6;jnene p&#xE5; ham, og det er som en helt p&#xE6;n lejlighed, han er inde i. Han siger jo, hvad han har sat sig for, at han kommer o. s. v. Han blev opvartet med mad og drikke og vil s&#xE5; g&#xE5;. Men s&#xE5; standsede den d&#xF8;de ham og sagde: "Hvem har l&#xE6;rt dig det? havde du ikke sagt det, s&#xE5; skulde a have spillet med dig, for du havde ingen ret til at tale til mig, da du kj&#xF8;rte forbi." S&#xE5; gav det igjen et skrald, og nu stod han igjen ude ved galgen, og s&#xE5; sved han hjem det bedste han kunde.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>It was just before Christmas, a man went to Aalborg early one morning and came past a gallows where a thief hung. At night, when he went home, he had had a nice big dram and was a bit drunk. Then he yells up to the thief: &#x201C;What are you hanging there and dangling for? It would be better if you came down and visited me Christmas eve.&#x201D; He drives along and comes home to his bed. Then the alcohol starts to wear off and he says to his wife: &#x201C;I think I made a mistake tonight.&#x201D; &#x201C;What was that?&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;When I drove past the gallows, I yelled out to the dead guy that he should come down and visit me Christmas eve.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, you shouldn&#x2019;t have done that, now we&#x2019;ll see what happens.&#x201D; Christmas eve comes and sure enough someone comes and knocks on the door. The man welcomes him and he&#x2019;s supposed to sit at the end of the table, and there was a big meal set out for him. It looked like he ate, but he didn&#x2019;t swallow any of it. When he was done, he thanked them and wanted to leave. &#x201C;Well, now you&#x2019;ll probably come up and visit me New Year&#x2019;s eve,&#x201D; he said. The man was a little spooked by the visit and he immediately says yes. Then he goes to the minister and wants to hear what the father will say about it and he tells him the whole story. The minister advises him that he should say, &#x201C;I come in God&#x2019;s name, and I will also leave in God&#x2019;s name.&#x201D; He plods up there New Year&#x2019;s eve and when he hears a clink, his eyes change for him, and it's like he's in a really nice apartment. He says what he had decided on, though, that he comes etc. He&#x2019;s served food and drink and then wants to go. But then the dead guy stops him and says, &#x201C;Who taught you that? If you hadn&#x2019;t said that, then I would&#x2019;ve toyed with you, since you had no right to talk to me when you drove past.&#x201D; Then there was a bang again and now he stood out by the gallows and then he sweated it home as fast as he could.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Til &#xE9;n af Scheelernes herreg&#xE5;rde i Jylland kom en mand (s&#xE5; vidt jeg mindes, hed han Bang) og l&#xE5; her en nat. Han havde da den dr&#xF6;m, at en skikkelse ved midnatstid viste sig ved hans seng og sagde ham, at der over porten var indmuret en skat i et j&#xE6;rnskrin, til hvilket den regjerende grev Scheel havde en guldn&#xF8;gle, og sagde ham, hvorledes stenene var stillede p&#xE5; det sted, for at han desto lettere kunde finde det. Den n&#xE6;ste dag rejste han videre, og i diligencen fortalte han denne dr&#xF6;m til sin nabo. Et &#xE5;rstid efter traf han tilf&#xE6;ldigvis grev Scheel og begyndte at tale med ham om denne sag. Greven havde ganske rigtig af sin bedstemoder f&#xE5;et en lille guldn&#xF8;gle, men hvortil den passede, havde aldrig nogen vidst. Han rejste nu hjem og lod hv&#xE6;lvingen unders&#xF8;ge, men fandt kun et tomt rum og spor til, at der for nylig var foretaget en unders&#xF8;gelse. Hvad der end mere bestyrkede denne tro var, at manden fra diligencen kort efter kj&#xF6;bte en stor herreg&#xE5;rd nede i Slesvig, uagtet det aldrig f&#xF6;r var bekjendt, at han var en rig mand.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A man (who as far as I remember was called Bang) came to one of Scheeler&#x2019;s manor farms in Jutland, and stayed there overnight. He had a dream that a figure appeared by his bed at about midnight and told him that a treasure had been walled in above the door in an iron chest, and that the ruling Count Scheel had a gold key which fit it, and told him how the stones were arranged there, so it would be easier for him to find. The next day he continued his journey and in the stagecoach he told the dream to the person sitting next to him. A year later he coincidentally met up with Count Scheel and began to talk to him about this matter. The Count said that he had, as a matter of fact, received a small gold key from his grandmother, but what it fit, he had never known. He went home now and had the archway inspected, but found only an empty room and tracks suggesting that it had been recently searched. What supported this even more was that the man from the stagecoach bought a large manor farm down by Slesvig shortly after, although he had never been known as a wealthy man.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Der var en gang en s&#xF8;mand fra Borre, der var ude at sejle ved S&#xF8;bj&#xE6;rg. Her fandt han en stor vante, som han tog og lod forf&#xE6;rdige mage til i Borre, og lagde dem s&#xE5; begge, hvor han havde fundet den f&#xF8;rste. Da han s&#xE5; nogen tid efter igjen sejlede ud fra Borre, h&#xF8;rte han, i det han kom forbi S&#xF8;bj&#xE6;rg, en st&#xE6;rk stemme r&#xE5;be :
"H&#xF8;r du, vantevennen min, 
l&#xE6;g skuden til Borre ind, 
ti Tolk skryer, 
og egene knager i Norge."
Skipperen lagde da ind til Borre igjen, og straks efter rejste sig en storm, som der ikke var set mage til, og alle de skibe, der var ude p&#xE5; havet, blev &#xF8;delagte.
      Borre er en by p&#xE5; M&#xF8;en, hvortil man sejlede i gamle dage. S&#xF8;bj&#xE6;rg var i den tid et bj&#xE6;rg i s&#xF8;en, nu er der enge der omkring. Det ligger mellem S&#xF8;mose og Klinten. "Tolk" er navnet p&#xE5; vandet i Gr&#xF6;nsund; det tolker uvejr for M&#xF8;enboerne. Fortalt af Kirsten Andersdatter i Borre, som har det fra sin fader. </danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Once there was a sailor from Borre who was out sailing near S&#xF8;bj&#xE6;rg. He found a big glove there, which he took and had its pair made in Borre, and he put them both down where he had found the first one. A little while later, when he sailed from Borre, he heard a loud voice yell when he came past S&#xF8;bj&#xE6;rg:
"Listen, my glove friend, 
put your skiff in at Borre,
since Tolk is shivering 
and the oaks in Norway are creaking." 
The skipper lay in at Borre again and immediately after a storm came up, and no one had ever seen anything like it, and all the ships that were out at sea were destroyed.
      Borre is a town on M&#xF8;en to which people sailed in the old days. S&#xF8;bj&#xE6;rg was at the time a mound out in the lake, but now it is surrounded by meadow. It is between S&#xF8;mose and Klinten. "Tolk" is the name of the water in Gr&#xF6;nsund (Green Sound); it predicts bad weather for the people of M&#xF8;en. This was told by Kirsten Andersdatter from Borre who learned it from her father.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>On Voldborg eve (Walpurgis eve; April 30) all the witches are supposed to ride to Troms church to meet. There was a farmhand who worked for a woman who was a witch. Now he had heard about the witches&#x2019; ride and decided to watch her that night to see if it really was true that she was going to make this trip. And sure enough, she sneaked out into the barn and smeared one of the steers on all its limbs with a salve which she had in a little pot. He watched carefully where she put the pot down. Then she went and got up on the steer and said: &#x201C;Here out and here away!&#x201D; and then the steer took off with her. Then the farmhand took the salve pot and went out and smeared the other steer and got up on it. But he couldn&#x2019;t really remember what he was supposed to say, and then he said: &#x201C;Here up and here down!&#x201D; and immediately it began hopping up and down with him, so that he was about to have his innards smashed to pieces. But then he remembered the right words and said: &#x201C;Here out and here away!&#x201D; and immediately the steer took off with him. When he got to the church, he stood outside and saw how the witches&#x2019; grandfather sat inside there and poured them wine from a gold horn. When he noticed that they were soon going to be done with their get together, he got up on his steer and took the other one's reins in his hands and said: &#x201C;Here out and here away!&#x201D; at which point he took off with both steers, and then he was home before daybreak. But it was several years before his employer came back from that trip.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Madam Ribert in Nanderup killed her driver and tossed his body in a water hole out in the swamp. There is still a stone down there which one can slide up and down; but it has never been taken up.

She had also killed a little child out in the barn, they claimed, and they believed that she had hidden it in that stone like a chest and then gotten the driver to drive it out to the swamp, but since she was afraid that he couldn&#x2019;t keep her secret, she pushed him backwards into the water hole and drove him down too. I&#x2019;ve gone about in the swamp and speared pike and run across that stone many many times; it sounds so hollow. It&#x2019;s just a little east of Nanderup in J&#xE6;rnkilde. Every seventh year she comes driving through the barn and then out and about and down along the farm. Then all the doors spring open. They heard it not too long ago. She was conjured down near Vilsund, and she raced the minister to the sound, him above ground and her under the ground, but he came too late and said: &#x201C;If it hadn&#x2019;t been Bj&#xE6;rgby sand and Sundby clay, I probably could have taken care of myself.&#x201D;</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Beboerne i L&#xF8;rslev, Ugilt sogn, vilde en gang grave Stovh&#xF6;j ud, som ligger i lilbj&#xE6;rge. De havde til sine tider set en drage h&#xE6;ve sig op over h&#xF6;jen om natten, omgiven af ildsluer. S&#xE5; kom de til en kiste, og straks var alle mand i f&#xE6;rd med at l&#xF8;fte den. Endelig havde de den ved gravens rand, men en kone, som ogs&#xE5; havde ved, var uforsigtig nok til at r&#xE5;be: "Hold nu fast." I samme &#xF6;jeblik faldt kisten fra dem, og de beholdt kun en hank af den.   
Fra dragen h&#xF8;rtes nu en r&#xF8;st:
"Nu er a 15 alen nede i jorden;
m&#xE5; a int i Stowh&#xF6;w blyww,
skal I &#xE5;ller m&#xE6; &#xE5; S&#xF8;rup s&#xF8; dryww."
Denne s&#xF8; ligger omtrent en fjerdingvej syd&#xF6;st for T&#xE5;rs kirke. Imod ondt vejr skal dragen kunne sees i s&#xF8;en som en lysning.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>One time the people in L&#xF8;rslev, in Ugilt parish, wanted to dig Stovh&#xF8;j out, it's over in Ilbj&#xE6;rge. They had seen a dragon rise up over the mound at night from time to time, surrounded by flames. They came to a chest, and immediately all the men began lifting it. Finally they had it at the edge of the pit, but a woman who was also holding onto it was careless enough to shout: "Hold on tight now." At the same moment, the chest fell out of their grip, and they only got to keep one of the chest's handles. 
From the dragon they now heard a voice: 
"Now I am thirty feet down in the ground. 
If I can't  stay in Stovh&#xF8;j, 
then you will never get me up out of S&#xF8;rup lake." 
That lake lies about a mile southwest of T&#xE5;rs church. During bad weather, the dragon could be seen in the lake like a lightning bolt.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Several years ago in Kragelund, a woman hung herself in a sheep pen. At that time, there was a minister in the parish named Ermandinger. After she had been buried, the minister decided that he wanted to conjure her up to find out how she was doing. So he went out and conjured her up, and she appeared like a black spirit up above him. To the question how she was doing, she answered that she was doing fine as long as it wasn&#x2019;t fear of Judgment Day.

      En gang kom der to doktorer og herredsfogden til konen i Vindbl&#xE6;s for at f&#xE6;ngsle hende. Men hun bad dem blot drage hjem og l&#xF8;ske lusene af dem. Da de nu kom hjem, var de s&#xE5; lusede, at de m&#xE5;tte til hende igjen for at blive fri for dem.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>At a place over here in Handest, they'd gone down to Vindbl&#xE6;s and the cunning woman there to ask for advice about an illness. When they came home, they threw the prescription away. Then the hired girl was sitting outside in the evening milking and a piece of paper flew into the bucket, and it was the prescription. She hadn't been with them down there, so it was strange that it came to her.
      One time two doctors and the district bailiff came down to the woman in Vindbl&#xE6;s to arrest her. But she asked them to go home and delouse themselves. When they got home, they were so covered with lice that they had to go back to her to get rid of them.</english_publication>

Now, they knew ahead of time that the bridge had washed out, and they went and discussed this: "If only there's a horse standing down there that will ride us over the stream." And when they got down there, a big black horse was standing in the water. Then they got up on it, one after the other, and there was still room for more. Then the first one looked back and said,
"Jesus Christ's cross, 
what a long horse!" 
Then the horse threw them all into the stream and disappeared.</english_publication>

Da blev hun s&#xE5; bange, at hun tabte m&#xE6;lken. Hun spurgte s&#xE5; pr&#xE6;sten ad, om hun m&#xE5;tte tale hende til. Pr&#xE6;sten sagde da, at det kunde hun godt, men hun skulde tage en salmebog i h&#xE5;nden, for hun vilde vist komme til at love hende noget, som hun skulde give hende h&#xE5;nden p&#xE5;, og s&#xE5; m&#xE5;tte hun ikke give hende h&#xE5;nden, men hun skulde r&#xE6;kke hende salmebogen. S&#xE5; spurgte hun da en gang gjengangeren: "Hvad g&#xE5;r I efter, moer ?" &#x2014; "Fem skilling i de r&#xF6;i skj&#xF6;rt, s&#xE5; kan a f&#xE5; ro i jorden, men lov mig, at du vil give min datter dem, og giv mig h&#xE5;nden derp&#xE5;." Hun rakte hende da salmebogen, og den tog hun s&#xE5; h&#xE5;rdt p&#xE5;, at det blev at se i den. De skar nu skj&#xF6;rtet op, og fandt fem skilling syet ind i livet.

    <english_publication>Once there was an old woman in St&#xF8;rtum who died, she had lived with her son and his wife. After she had been buried, she went again and she was dressed all in white, she went and rummaged about in the bed by the children and out in the barn. Then they looked in the bed and found some balls of yarn and in the barn there was a red skirt that had belonged to the deceased. They took it and hung it in the kitchen, but then the revenant appeared there. One time, when the son's wife went out to the kitchen with a pail of milk, she was standing there. She got so scared that she dropped the milk. She asked the minister if it would be alright if she spoke with her. The minister said that she certainly could, but that she should bring a book of psalms with her, since she would probably wind up promising the ghost something and the ghost would ask her to give her her hand on it, but she should not give her her hand but rather hand her the psalm book. So she asked the revenant once, "What are you looking for, mother?" -- "Five shillings in the red skirt, then I can have peace in the ground, but promise me that you will give them to my daughter, and give me your hand on that." She handed her the psalm book, and the ghost grabbed it so hard that it left a mark. They cut the skirt up and found five shillings sewn into the waistband. Then they didn't see her anymore.</english_publication>

Next the minister showed him a place where he was supposed to wait and he was supposed to stay at that place until the minister came again, however long that was. While the farmhand waited, he thought he heard the minister complaining. Then the moon rose and he could see that the minister lay on the ground a little bit away. He went over and called to him. The minister said that that was bad for him. &#x201C;Now I&#x2019;m lost.&#x201D; With that he got up and drove with the farmhand home and the next day he drowned himself in a marl pit out in the back yard.</english_publication>

Der kom han i dagningen, og da pr&#xE6;sten kom ud i d&#xF6;ren for at tage imod rytteren, blev han ikke lidt forundret, da han s&#xE5;, at det var hans egen avlskarl, der kom ridende. S&#xE5; fortalte han pr&#xE6;sten, at han havde kj&#xF6;bt s&#xE5;dan en dejlig sort hoppe, om pr&#xE6;sten havde ikke lyst til at kj&#xF8;be den af ham. Jo, han syntes godt om den, og s&#xE5; var handelen snart sluttet. Karlen spurgte dern&#xE6;st, om han ikke skulde ride hen til smedjen og f&#xE5; hoppen skoet, for det tr&#xE6;ngte den til. Det gav pr&#xE6;sten sit samtykke til, og da karlen kom tilbage med den, str&#xF8;g han bidselet af, og pr&#xE6;stekonen stod da med sko under h&#xE6;nder og f&#xF6;dder.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A minister had a chief farmhand and every morning when he woke up, he was so tired and he was so sore in his limbs, he felt like he had being doing the hardest work. Then he sought the advice of a cunning man, who told him the reason for his illness. It was namely the minister&#x2019;s wife who threw sleep on him and, by putting a witch bridle on him, she turned him into a horse and then rode him to Troms. He was so tired from that the next morning and had sore limbs. Then he advised him that the next St. Hans eve when he lay down in bed, he should rub his neck down hard into the pillow and continue to do that even if he fell asleep. He tried that. During the night he woke up and he was standing by a church and had a bridle in his hand, it was tied to the church hitching post, and round about stood a huge crowd of horses, who were tied in the same way. A little later the minister&#x2019;s wife came out of the church and he threw the bridle over her head, following the cunning man&#x2019;s advice, and immediately she was changed into a beautiful black mare. He sat himself up to ride and rode home to the parsonage. He got there at dawn and when the minister came out of the door to greet the rider, he wasn&#x2019;t just a little surprised when he saw that it was his own chief farmhand who came riding. Then he told the minister that he&#x2019;d bought this beautiful black mare, and didn&#x2019;t the minister want to buy it from him. Yes, he liked it and then the deal was made. The farmhand asked next if he shouldn&#x2019;t ride it over to the smith and have the mare shod, because it needed it. The minister consented to that and when the farmhand came back with it, he pulled the bridle off and the minister&#x2019;s wife stood there with horseshoes on her hands and feet.</english_publication>

The hired girl got suspicious of him since he wandered about and looked so closely at everything, and one day when he got his knife sharpened they started to think the worst. Therefore they kept a watch out, and the miller&#x2019;s wife had an axe nearby at night, and her husband had a knife. One night the peddler broke in and wanted to kill them. The husband got exactly what he had coming, but the wife called out for the farmhand, even though they didn&#x2019;t have one, to attack the robber so he got scared and jumped out of the upper door in the scullery. In his haste, he lost a silver button, and they found it. Then another man took it around to various inns in the area and other such places that peddlers seek out. Finally he met the man who had the same buttons on his jacket. He talked to him and asked him if he wasn&#x2019;t missing a button. No, he said, no. &#x201C;Well, well let&#x2019;s take a look, since I've got one here that matches those.&#x201D; The others in the room helped him see, and he was missing one sure enough. Then he was grabbed and put out on a rack out there on the heath near the inn where he had killed the other man.</english_publication>

In particular, there was a place where there had been a farm that had been moved because of the sand drifts. When he got there, he was really frightened and read his Our Father. All at once, he saw a flock of hares that were running about among the piles of gravel playing. He could tell right away that they weren't really hares since their back legs couldn't bend. He made a decision at once. He went over to the flock and named a woman who was from a neighboring farm who was known as a witch. At once, the woman was standing there and said, "That's the worst thing that anyone has ever done to me." She disappeared after that, and a little later she was dead. But the man didn't get away from that well. When he got to where he was going, he was sick, and was bedridden for a long time after.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>In H&#xE5;rmark, there had once been two farms, each of which had a nisse. The nisser were treated well since there was often a bowl of milk set out in the hayloft for them, and on holidays they got porridge with a big pat of butter in it. Because of this, the nisser were very willing to serve and sought out all different ways to benefit their masters. Thus it was common that they tossed hay and sheaves down from the hayloft. Sometimes for a joke they would throw sheaves down on people who came into the barn at night. Sometimes, the nisser would also steal from the neighbors. Between the farms there was a pond and when that was iced over, one often saw them crossing over it with something they had swiped from the neighbor&#x2019;s. It happened many times that they had both been out on similar errands and met on the way home out on the ice and on such occasions it often turned into an incredible fight, so that the plunder was scattered about all over the place.</english_publication>

S&#xE5; kunde hun f&#xE5; kj&#xE6;rnen fuld og f&#xE5; s&#xE5; dejligt sm&#xF6;r. En dag hun ikke var hjemme, skulde datteren til at kj&#xE6;rne, men hun var mere begj&#xE6;rlig end moderen og sagde: "Et fadfuld af hver mand og en spandfuld fra Rammeg&#xE5;rd." Da kom hun til at st&#xE5; i fl&#xF8;de til midt p&#xE5; livet.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Jens Plovg&#xE5;rd's wife Maren in Ramme was also a witch and when she was going to churn, she put the empty churn in the room and then she said, "Now, in God's name, a spoonful from each man and a bowlful from Rammeg&#xE5;rd." Then the churn would be filled and she'd get wonderful butter. One day, when she wasn't home, her daughter was going to churn, but she was more demanding than her mother and said, "A bowlful from each man and a bucketful from Rammeg&#xE5;rd." She wound up standing there with cream half way up her waist.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Mailman Niels Pedersen in Vejle says that near Dalhus up in Vejen forest, at the boundary between Vejen and Malt, one can every now and then hear the rattling of chains at night. The boundary between the parishes is wrong, and because of that, a land surveyor supposedly goes there with his chains.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Skj&#xE6;rn sogn ligger g&#xE5;rdene N&#xF6;rholt og Brovang. Mange havde set lys p&#xE5; N&#xF6;rholts mark, og det var en almindelig tale, at her var en skat begravet. De to m&#xE6;nd havde tit talt om, at de vilde gj&#xF8;re et fors&#xF8;g p&#xE5; at finde den, og en aften skulde da den ene st&#xE5; i N&#xF6;rholts g&#xE5;rd, medens den anden gik efter lyset, og s&#xE5; bl&#xE6;se i en fl&#xF6;jte, n&#xE5;r han n&#xE5;ede det, ti lyset forsvandt for den, der n&#xE6;rmede sig, men skinnede lige klart for den, som stod i afstand. Niels Brovang gik s&#xE5; med en stok i h&#xE5;nden, og da han h&#xF8;rte fl&#xF6;jten, stak han stokken i jorden. Kort efter kom Niels N&#xF6;rholt og hans pige med spader og skovle, og s&#xE5; grov de med stor iver. Endelig st&#xF6;dte de mod noget h&#xE5;rdt, og det viste sig at v&#xE6;re l&#xE5;get af en kasse. Den ene sprang nu ned og fik fat i en l&#xE5;dden hund. Af skr&#xE6;k vilde han straks have l&#xF8;bet sin vej, men pigen var mere modig, hun tog sit t&#xF6;rkl&#xE6;de af hovedet og bredte p&#xE5; gr&#xE6;sset, l&#xF8;ste sit forkl&#xE6;de af og greb om hunden med. S&#xE5; sagde den, da hun havde lagt den p&#xE5; t&#xF6;rkl&#xE6;det: "Fordi du tog mig s&#xE5; godt og lagde mig s&#xE5; bl&#xF6;dt, skal du have lov til at tage skatten." Nu gik hun atter ned i hullet og fik fat p&#xE5; en kande s&#xE5; tung, at hun n&#xE6;ppe kunde l&#xF8;fte den op. Derefter lagde hun igjen hunden p&#xE5; sin plads, og de kastede hullet til. Da de kom hjem, viste det sig, at kanden var fuld af guldm&#xF8;nter. S&#xE5; delte begge g&#xE5;rdm&#xE6;ndene dem imellem sig og gav pigen en lille sum for hendes udviste mod.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The farms N&#xF8;rholt and Brovang are in Skj&#xE6;rn parish. Many people had seen a light on N&#xF8;rholt&#x2019;s fields, and it was common knowledge that there was a treasure buried there. Two men had often talked about making an attempt at finding it and one night one of them was supposed to stand in the courtyard of N&#xF8;rholt farm while the other went after the light, and then the one in the courtyard was to blow a whistle when the one walking toward the light reached it, since the light disappeared for the person who approached it, but burned just as clearly for the person who stood at a distance. Niels Brovang went with a staff in his hand and when he heard the whistle he planted the staff in the ground. A little after Niels N&#xF8;rholt and his hired girl came with spades and shovels, and they began digging with great energy. Finally they banged into something hard, and it turned out to be the cover of a chest. One of them jumped down now and got hold of a shaggy dog. He wanted to run away out of shear fright, but the girl was more courageous, she took her scarf off her head and spread it on the grass, took off her apron and grabbed the dog with it. Then it said, when she had laid it on the scarf: &#x201C;Because you took me so well and laid me down so softly, you shall have permission to take the treasure." Now she went down into the hole again and took hold of a pitcher that was so heavy that she barely could lift it up. When they got home, it turned out that the pitcher was full of gold coins. Then the two farmers split it amongst themselves and gave the girl a small sum for her hitherto unknown courage.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Den hvide hugorm kan blive til en lindorm, n&#xE5;r den bliver ved at gro, men ingen f&#xE5;r den at se. Der var et bitte krumme krat i heden ved Undertiden bj&#xE6;rg, der ogs&#xE5; kaldes Pirrup krat, og der havde en karl sk&#xE5;ret sig en kj&#xE6;p i det krat. S&#xE5; kommer han til Kj&#xF6;benhavn i tjenesten, og der m&#xF8;der han en mand p&#xE5; gaden, som tager ved denne her kj&#xE6;p og kommer til at se p&#xE5; den. S&#xE5; sp&#xF6;rger han ham ad, hvor han havde sk&#xE5;ret den. Ja, han svarer, at han havde sk&#xE5;ret den p&#xE5; et sted, hvor han havde frihed til at skj&#xE6;re. S&#xE5; siger den anden, om han ikke nok kunde vise stedet, hvor han havde sk&#xE5;ret kj&#xE6;ppen. Det sagde han jo til, men det kunde jo ikke lade sig gj&#xF8;re nu, da det var i Vendsyssel, og han var i Kj&#xF6;benhavn. Ja, han skulde nok f&#xE5; frihed til at rejse, siger manden, n&#xE5;r han kunde bestemt vise, hvad gren han havde sk&#xE5;ret kj&#xE6;ppen p&#xE5;. Ja, det var han sikker nok p&#xE5;, men det var ikke sikkert, at den passede til stumpen, for han havde sk&#xE5;ret et stykke af kj&#xE6;ppen. Det gjorde heller ikke noget, kunde han blot vise ham grenen og tr&#xE6;et, vilde de rejse efter det. De rejste ogs&#xE5; og kom til stedet, og han fremviste kvisten. S&#xE5; bl&#xE6;ste den fremmede mand i kvisten, og i det samme v&#xE6;ldede der en masse hugorme op om dem. S&#xE5; blev karlen forskr&#xE6;kket og vilde have stukket i rend, men den anden sagde, at han skulde ikke v&#xE6;re bange, han skulde nok love ham, at de ikke skulde gj&#xF8;re ham noget. Endelig kom den hvide hugorm op, og han tog den, og de rejste igjen.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The white viper can become a lindorm if it gets a chance to continue to grow but nobody sees it. There was a tiny little thicket in the heath near Underliden mountain, it was also called Pirrup thicket, and a farmhand had cut himself a switch in the thicket. Then he comes to Copenhagen to work, and he meets a man on the road, who takes this switch and looks at it. Then he asks him where he'd cut it. Well, he answered, I cut it in a place where I was allowed to cut. Then the other one asks if he couldn't be allowed to see the place where he'd cut the switch. The farmhand agreed to that, but they couldn't do it now, it was in Vendsyssel, and he was in Copenhagen. Well, he'd be given free to travel, says the man, if he could show precisely from which branch he had cut the switch. Yes, he was certain he could do that, but he wasn't sure it would fit the switch, since he'd cut a piece from the switch. That didn't matter, just as long as he could show him the branch and the tree, then they'd go on the trip for that. They went off and came to the place and he showed him the branch. Then the strange man blew into the branch and, at that moment, a whole bunch of vipers came up around them. Then the farmhand got scared and would have run away, but the other one said he shouldn't be scared, he promised him that they wouldn't do anything to him. Finally, the white viper came up, and he took it, and they traveled off again.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Ved den kgl. Lerskov plantage ligger et vand, som kaldes Klarvand. Det vand har ikke altid v&#xE6;ret der, det er nemlig opfyldt med en m&#xE6;ngde omstyrtede tr&#xE6;er, og der m&#xE5; i gamle dage have v&#xE6;ret en stor skov. Per Jensen fra &#xD6;ster-L&#xF6;gum var en gang der ude, og da s&#xE5; han med &#xE9;t en k&#xE6;mpestor mand rejse sig, han havde h&#xE6;gter i kl&#xE6;derne i stedet for knapper og s&#xE5; for&#xF8;vrigt underlig ud. Men som nu Per begyndte at se p&#xE5; ham, gav han et br&#xF6;l fra sig, s&#xE5; &#xD6;sterl&#xF8;gum kirket&#xE5;rn revnede.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Near the Royal Lerskov Orchard there is a pond, which is called Klarvand (Clear pond). The pond hasn&#x2019;t always been there, it&#x2019;s been filled up with a large number of fallen trees since then, and there must have been a big forest there in the olden days. Per Jensen from &#xD8;ster L&#xF8;gum was out there once and then he saw a gigantic man get up all of a sudden, he had hooks on his clothes instead of buttons and looked quite odd. But now while Per began to look at him, he roared so loud that the church tower in &#xD8;ster L&#xF8;gum cracked.</english_publication>

Before that, he was poor and miserable, but now he'd become the richest man on B&#xF6;rglum manor and exchanged sixteen thousand rixdollars when the bank law changed.</english_publication>

He got up on it, but it rode with him out into a millpond, so he had to get off at the bank, and the horse disappeared into the millpond with a loud roar, when he had gotten off.

    <english_publication>About sixty years ago, the marsh that now belongs to Sebberkloster (Sebber monastery) was a big morass filled with ponds and streams. Early one morning, a man walked along the road from Barmer township to Store Ajstrup which is now an annex of Sebber but used to belong to Lundby. He saw a man floating above the marsh, and as far as the man could tell, he was carrying a large load of cobbler&#x2019;s work on his back. He didn&#x2019;t touch the ground with his feet, and he couldn&#x2019;t have anyway as there wasn&#x2019;t as much as a dry spot that a bird could land on.

    <english_publication>They've heard suicides cry in a mother's womb. Some could see when a suicide was nearby, and could say to others as he passed by: We won't see him anymore. One could see that a black dog was following them and that the devil was haunting them until he got them. One man thought about hanging himself, but had second thoughts about it when he felt something jump on his back and pull him down. He managed to name God's name, and it hopped off and he was saved. A girl wanted to drown herself. She was already down by the water to feel if it was cold. No, it was almost lukewarm, and the meadow had a strange shimmer, she'd never seen anything like it. She wanted to die, but first she wanted to say her Our Father. When she said amen, she heard a horrible scream that echoed across the meadow, and everything lost its beautiful gleam. The water was no longer warm either, and the girl hurried home.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>For mange &#xE5;r siden, f&#xF6;r den nye landevej blev lagt gjennem Fyen fra Middelfart til Bogense, gik vejen mellem disse to byer norden om B&#xE5;ring gjennem B&#xE5;ring skov og langs med den vej fra Kattegat, som str&#xE6;kker sig ind mod byen og kaldes B&#xE5;ringvej. Den del af B&#xE5;ring skov, som vejen gik igjennem, hed Kragelund, og her havde en r&#xF6;verbande sin hule. For at kunne h&#xF8;re, n&#xE5;r folk f&#xE6;rdedes, havde de trukket snore tv&#xE6;rs over vejen, og i snorene h&#xE6;ngte de s&#xE5; henne ved hulen klokker, der ringede, s&#xE5; snart snorene r&#xF8;rte sig. S&#xE5; styrtede r&#xF6;verne ud og plyndrede og dr&#xE6;bte dem, der kom der forbi. En gang fik de fat i en pige, men hun var s&#xE5; kj&#xF6;n, at de ikke n&#xE6;nnede at dr&#xE6;be hende, og tog hende da med til deres hule. Der blev hun i lang tid og gjorde r&#xF6;vernes arbejde i hulen, og lod i det hele, som hun var godt tilfreds med at v&#xE6;re der. S&#xE5; en gang bad hun om lov til at g&#xE5; hjem til barselgilde hos en s&#xF8;ster. R&#xF6;verne vilde n&#xF8;dig give hende lov, men til sidst sagde de dog ja, n&#xE5;r hun vilde love aldrig at tale til noget menneske om, hvor hun var, og det lovede hun ogs&#xE5;. Der var stort gilde hos s&#xF8;steren, og da folk s&#xE5; hende, der havde v&#xE6;ret borte s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge, spurgte de hende meget ud, men hun sagde aldrig et ord. Efter m&#xE5;ltidet gik folk ud at se sig om, og hun gik da ogs&#xE5; ud. Men i et af gulvene stod en sule, den gik hun hen og tog omkring med begge sine arme, og for den fortalte &#x2014; eller rettere sang &#x2014; hun, hvad hun ikke turde sige noget menneske:
"I B&#xE5;ring skov, i Kragelund
der l&#xE5; de r&#xF6;vere sytten,
jeg siger det hverken for folk eller f&#xE6;
men kun for denne st&#xF6;tte." 
Folk h&#xF8;rte dog godt, hvad hun sagde, og da hun lidt efter gik hjem til r&#xF6;verkulen, gav de hende en lille pose med gryn i og skar en lille rift i bunden, s&#xE5; da hun gik, tegnede hun med gryn en vej lige til r&#xF6;verboet. De blev da overrumplede og fangede allesammen og derp&#xE5; henrettede.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Many years ago before the new highway was built across Fyn from Middelfart to Bogense, the road went between these two towns north of B&#xE5;ring, through B&#xE5;ring woods along the road from the Kattegat, which stretches in towards town and is called B&#xE5;ring road. The part of the B&#xE5;ring woods that the road went through was called Kragelund and a robber gang had its den here.They had pulled a rope across the road to hear when people traveled by, and they hung bells on the rope near the den which rang as soon as the ropes were touched. Then the robbers jumped out and plundered and killed those people who came by. Once they got hold of a girl but she was so beautiful that they didn&#x2019;t have the heart to kill her and they brought her along to their den. She was there for a long time and did the robbers&#x2019; work in the den and made like she was quite happy being there. Then one time she asked permission to go home to a baby shower at her sister&#x2019;s house. The robbers didn&#x2019;t really want to let her go, but they finally said yes if she promised not to talk to any people about where she was (living), and she promised that too. There was a big party at her sister&#x2019;s house and when people saw her, they asked her a lot of questions since she had been away so long, but she never said a word. After the meal people went out to take a look around and she also went out. But in one of the stalls there was a support beam, and she went over to it and held it with both her arms and she told it &#x2014; or rather sang &#x2014; what she didn&#x2019;t say to other people: 
&#x201C;In B&#xE5;ring woods, in Kragelund 
there lie the robbers seventeen 
I&#x2019;m saying it to neither man nor beast 
but only to this support beam.&#x201D; 
People listened well to what she said and a little bit later when she went home to the robber den, they gave her a little bag of meal and cut a little hole in the bottom, so when she walked she drew a path with meal right to the robbers&#x2019; hideaway. They were taken by surprise and caught all together and then executed.</english_publication>

People who passed by could see them well enough, but they only got to see them from the front, where they looked quite nice. A shepherd from Alken who had been out putting the sheep down for the night, came by on his way home. He stopped to watch the dance. A little later an elf girl came and asked him to the dance and he went with her without thinking anything about it. The next morning some people passed by the mound and they found his body, he&#x2019;d been danced to death by the elf girl.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Der er en g&#xE5;rd i T&#xF8;ving, der hedder Tingh&#xF6;jg&#xE5;rd, og her boede en gang en gammel mand, der gik s&#xE5;dan noget underlig kl&#xE6;dt, han gik altid i nogle gamle brogede l&#xE6;derbukser og s&#xE5; en stor ulden tr&#xF6;je, der h&#xE6;ngte og slubrede runden om ham, og endelig en gammel rundpuldet hat p&#xE5; hovedet. Den samme gamle mand gik hen og h&#xE6;ngte sig, og siden sagde de, at han sp&#xF6;gte p&#xE5; g&#xE5;rden og gik, ligesom han gik i levende live. Min gamlefader kom s&#xE5; til at forpagte den g&#xE5;rd. Der var s&#xE5;dan en voldsom stor dagligstue, og henne i bagsiden var to senge, der var panelet inde, men i forsiden var forstued&#xF6;ren og kj&#xF8;kkend&#xF6;ren lige for hinanden. Min moder og s&#xE5; deres tjenestepige l&#xE5; i den ene seng. S&#xE5; var det en aften ved midnatstide, min moder l&#xE5; v&#xE5;gen, og m&#xE5;nen skinnede ind, s&#xE5; hun kunde se alting, da kom der pludselig en skikkelse ind ad stued&#xF6;ren. Hun kunde tydelig kjende, at det var den her gamle mand, hun havde jo set ham s&#xE5; mange gange, og det var, ligesom han gik og stod. Hun s&#xE5; ikke, d&#xF6;ren gik op, men han skred lige s&#xE5; stille over stuegulvet og keg sig runden omkring. Hun tykte tydelig, hun kunde h&#xF8;re, det sukkede, og endelig skred det ud af kj&#xF8;kkend&#xF6;ren, og s&#xE5; m&#xE6;rkede hun ikke til videre. De kunde aldrig holde deres staldd&#xF6;r lukt om aftenen, og de kunde h&#xF8;re, det slog med den, i hvor tit de lukte den.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There is a farm in T&#xF8;ving which is called Tingh&#xF8;jg&#xE5;rd and an old man used to live there, he went about dressed oddly, he always went about in old spotted leather pants and a big woolen sweater which hung and flopped about him, and finally an old round hat on his head. That same old man went and hanged himself and, ever since, they said that he haunted at the farm and went about at the farm just as he had when he was alive. My grandfather got a lease on that farm. There was a really big living room, and in the back there were two beds which were paneled in but, in the front, there was the door to the front room and the kitchen door right beside each other. My mother and their serving girl lay in one of the beds. One night about midnight, my mother was lying awake and the moon was shining in so she could see everything, then all of a sudden a shape came in through the door. She clearly recognized that it was the old man, she had seen him many times and it seemed like he walked in and stood there. She didn&#x2019;t see the door open, but he went so quietly over the floor and looked around. She thought she could clearly hear that he sighed. Finally it went out the kitchen door. They could never keep their barn door closed at night and they could hear it banging regardless how often they closed it.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>In a birthing house, after everything was done with, the midwife lay down next to the mother who lay with her newborn child in her arms, and the other women sat on another bed. Soon they all fell asleep since they had been at it for a long time; but the mother, who apparently wasn&#x2019;t sleeping too soundly, wakes with some sort of rustling which she felt near her and she sees to her great horror that her child is gone. While she looks about, her eyes fall on the elf woman who is sitting on the threshold with the mother's child and is in the process of throwing her legs over the threshold; because of their short legs they couldn&#x2019;t get over the threshold in any other way. Then the mother screamed loudly and cried with a loud voice: &#x201C;That shall Jesus forbid you!&#x201D; Then the elf woman dropped the child and disappeared. The mother jumped out of bed to get her child again and the midwife and the other women got so scared that they almost didn&#x2019;t know what was going on. The father didn&#x2019;t delay getting the minister and having the child baptized.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Den samme pr&#xE6;stekone i Hassing, der brugte karlen til ridehest, n&#xE5;r hun red til Troms kirke, og til sidst fik j&#xE6;rnsko p&#xE5; h&#xE6;nder og f&#xF6;dder, hun &#xF8;vede ogs&#xE5; en kommers i hendes forrige mands tid. Han var provst, men om det var mere end navnet, han bar, skal jeg lade v&#xE6;re usagt. S&#xE5; var der et bryllup i sognet, hvor han ogs&#xE5; var indbuden. Mens gj&#xE6;sterne sad ved bordene, kom en hvid kat g&#xE5;ende frem og tilbage p&#xE5; gulvet. En af gj&#xE6;sterne, der havde mere end almindelig kundskab, sagde til en af de andre: "V&#xE6;r s&#xE5; god at st&#xE5; til side, og lad provstinden g&#xE5; om." Men aldrig s&#xE5; snart hendes navn var n&#xE6;vnet, f&#xF6;r hun stod helt n&#xF8;gen, som hun var f&#xF8;dt til verden, i steden for katten. S&#xE5; snart hendes mand s&#xE5; dette, sank han ned under det bord, han sad ved, og d&#xF8;de straks.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The same minister's wife in Hassing who had used the farmhand as a horse when she rode to Troms church, and finally been shod with iron horseshoes on her hands and feet, she had also done things in her previous husband's day. He was a curate, but whether it was more than the title that he carried, I'll leave unsaid. Then there was a wedding there in the parish to which he had been invited as well. While the guests were sitting at the tables, a white cat came in and walked back and forth across the floor. One of the guests, who knew more than the average person, said to one of the others: "Please step aside, and let the curate's wife pass." But as soon as he'd said that, she was standing there as naked as the day she was born instead of the cat. As soon as her husband saw that, he sank down under the table where he was sitting and died.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En mand, som har tjent i Voermark, har fortalt mig f&#xF8;lgende: "Da jeg tjente der, havde vi altid uheld med vore kalve; n&#xE5;r de var vokset noget til, s&#xE5; l&#xE5; de gj&#xE6;rne om morgenen og var d&#xF8;de i b&#xE5;sene. Vi hentede den kloge mand fra Fr&#xF8;rup; han kom en aften, da det var et forf&#xE6;rdeligt m&#xF8;rke og regnvejr. Jeg tilb&#xF8;d ham at f&#xF8;lge ham ud omkring med en lygte, han skulde nemlig have noget lagt under hver d&#xF8;rt&#xE6;rskel, hvor der var kreaturer inde; men han vilde ikke have mig med, han gik ene ud. Da han var f&#xE6;rdig, skulde jeg kj&#xF8;re ham til Fr&#xF8;rup; det vilde jeg n&#xF8;dig, da det var s&#xE5; m&#xF8;rkt. Jeg sagde til ham, at han kunde blive til n&#xE6;ste dag. Hertil svarede han nej. "Er jeg ikke ude af g&#xE5;rden inden kl. tolv, s&#xE5; g&#xE5;r det nok galt." Jeg m&#xE5;tte af sted med ham; men efter den tid trivedes vore kalve godt. Han havde dog glemt et sted, og det var f&#xE5;rehuset, s&#xE5; nu gik det ud over lammene, indtil vi flyttede huset, s&#xE5; var alting godt.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A man who worked at Voermark told me the following: When I worked there, we always had misfortune with our calves; after they had grown a bit, they would often be lying dead in their stalls the next morning. We got the cunning man from Fr&#xF8;rup; he come one evening when it was really dark and rainy. I offered to follow him out there and around with a lantern, he was supposed to put something under the threshold of each stall where there were animals; but he didn't want me along, he went out alone. When he was done, I was to drive him to Fr&#xF8;rup; I didn't want to since it was so dark. I told him that he could stay until the next day. He answered no. "If I am not out of the farm by twelve o'clock, things will go wrong." I had to leave with him; but after that time, our calves did well. He had forgotten a place though, and that was the sheep house, and so now it affected the lambs, until we moved that house, and then everything was OK.</english_publication>

Late at night, the nisse comes out to the porridge and he gets mad and he kills the best cow. After that he goes back to the porridge and finds the butter. Now he knew that there was a similar cow over in Mors, they looked exactly alike, and so he switches them. The girl couldn't tell the difference between the two when she went out to milk, but Jens H&#xE5;rby could and he got the nisse to admit it.

Da kommer der en havfrue op lige t&#xE6;t ved hans b&#xE5;d, og hun tr&#xE6;kker en hose af den ene fod og p&#xE5; den anden, og det lige s&#xE5; s&#xE5;re, hun havde ikke uden &#xE9;n hose, og den byttede hun idelig. Men s&#xE5; river han en sok af hans ene ben &#x2014; han havde jo undersokker &#x2014; og kyler ud til havfruen. Hun snapper den og s&#xE6;tter ned igjen i vandet.

    <english_publication>Merfolk certainly exist. In 1826, when the sea broke in, it had been such incredibly beautiful weather the day before. It was the day that they were supposed to have their Christmas dinner and so the fishermen had gone out and had really started to fish. Then there was one fisherman who was a little ways away from the others fishing. Then a mermaid comes up right next to his boat, and she pulls a sock off one foot and puts it on the other, and it looked so sad, she only had one sock, and she was switching it quickly from one foot to the other. But then he pulls a sock off one of his legs--he had undersocks on--and throws it to the mermaid. She snags it and goes under the water again. After she'd been down for a quarter of an hour or so, then she comes up right next to his boat: "Listen man who gave me the sock, you should hurry ashore, otherwise you'll wind up eating your Christmas dinner here tonight." Then he and his buddies hurried to get ashore, and just as soon as they had come ashore, the mermaid raised such huge a storm that everyone who was at sea drowned. But the man and his men were saved. That was the day the sea broke in.</english_publication>

De skulde have fat i en frugtsommelig kone og skj&#xE6;re barnet ud af hende, og var det s&#xE5; et drengebarn, skulde de tage hj&#xE6;rtet af det og spise, s&#xE5; kunde de flyve.

Endelig var der en mand, som hed Store-Johan, han var noget i komplot med dem, og han solgte hans kone til dem.

    <english_publication>There were twelve robbers in Ry woods and their leader was the thirteenth. A road went through the woods and they had strung up a rope with bells on it so they could hear when somebody came by. They had made a pact with the devil and he was supposed to teach them what they needed to do so they could fly. They had to get hold of a pregnant woman and cut the child out of her, and if it was a male child, they were supposed to take its heart and eat it, then they could fly. So they killed thirteen women, but there were girls in all of them, and they didn&#x2019;t get much out of that. Finally there was a man who was called Store-Johan (Big Johan) who was in cahoots with them and he sold them his wife. They tied her stark-naked to a tree and were going to cut into her. But at that moment some riflemen from a manor farm came riding by and they chased them away and then the robbers and the man were caught. The woman died and it turned out that she was carrying two boys, but now they didn&#x2019;t get anything out of that. There&#x2019;s a ballad about that, which I&#x2019;ve heard, but I don&#x2019;t know if it has been printed.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A bishop who is believed to have brought the plague to the country lies buried in the bishop&#x2019;s grave in Sj&#xF8;rring cemetery. There had been a storm for several days, but then the weather got better. Two men from Dollerup wanted to go to the beach to scavenge, and there they found the remains of a deck house in which there was a well-dressed man. They wanted to kill him at first, but he begged them to let him live and bring him to the minister. They take him and lead him to Sj&#xF8;rring church and get there just as the minister and the congregation were coming out of the church. The minister now blesses him and immediately afterward the man dies. The flesh falls from his bones and most of the people who were present get sick and die. But before he died, he explained that he was a bishop from Antwerp and was going to B&#xF8;rglum parish to be bishop. But he didn&#x2019;t get there, now his grave was to be in Sj&#xF8;rring. The two men who carried him there survived the plague. For twelve or thirteen months a fog lay over the area and during that time the plague raged. There was a belief that anyone who saw the sun could live and therefore they kept those who they could outside, but most people were so bad off they couldn&#x2019;t be outside.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Nogle fort&#xE6;ller, at da skibet kom til grundene i fjorden, kunde det ikke komme over, og for at lette det m&#xE5;tte de kaste den ene klokke over bord. Andre fort&#xE6;ller, at den blev tabt, da den skulde b&#xE6;res fra skibet i land. Klokken i t&#xE5;rnet har om helligaftenerne en vidunderlig vemodig klang og kalder p&#xE5; den anden, som svarer den fra fjordens bund.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Some say that when the ship ran aground in the fjord, they couldn&#x2019;t get over it, so they had to throw one of the bells overboard. Others say that the bell was lost when it was to be carried from the ship to land. The bell has a wonderful melancholy clang on holy nights and it calls after the other one, which answers from the bottom of the fjord.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En bedefredag skulde mand og kone p&#xE5; Enerisg&#xE5;rd til alters, og s&#xE5; var der en gammel kone at passe p&#xE5;, mens de var borte. Hun s&#xE5; mange blodpletter b&#xE5;de p&#xE5; en gammel l&#xE6;nestol, der stod i kakkelovnskrogen, og i deres forstue og udenfor d&#xF8;ren. Da de kom hjem, spurgte hun om det. De foregav, at de havde v&#xE6;ret ved at slagte en h&#xF6;ne, og den var fl&#xF8;jen omkring der inde, og det var blodet af den, hun havde seet. Men det var nu en knippelskr&#xE6;mmer, der var sl&#xE5;et ihjel. Den mand, der skulde have gjort det, hed Lavst, og hans fader Hans Eneris var ogs&#xE5; med til det. Lavst var aldrig rask siden og gik og var s&#xE5; s&#xF6;lle. Da Hans Eneris skulde begraves, var en anden s&#xF6;n, der kaldtes Anders Rognsbj&#xE6;rg og boede i Brejning, hjemme til begravelsen, og Lavst skulde kj&#xF8;re. Da de nu vilde gjennem porten med liget, stod hestene helt stille. "Lad mig kj&#xF8;re," sagde Anders og tog ved t&#xF6;mmen. S&#xE5; stod hestene op i &#xE6; vindvejr og gav et spring, og s&#xE5; kunde de kj&#xF8;re. Siden har der v&#xE6;ret s&#xE5;dant sp&#xF8;geri i den g&#xE5;rd.

    <english_publication>One day the fourth Friday after Easter, a man and his wife from Enerisg&#xE5;rd were going to church and there was an old woman at home to take care of the house while they were gone. She saw a lot of blood spots on both an old recliner, which was in the wood-burning stove nook, and in their front room and outside of the door. When they got home, she asked about it. They pretended that they had been slaughtering a chicken and it had flown around in there, and it was the blood from that that she had seen. But it was actually a peddler who had been killed. The man who was supposed to have done it was called Laust and his father Hans Eneris was also involved. Laust was never healthy after that and went around and was so wretched. When Hans Eneris was to be buried, another son who was called Anders Rognsbj&#xE6;rg and lived in Brejning came home for the funeral and Laust was supposed to drive. When they wanted to get through the farm portal with the corpse, the horses stood totally still. &#x201C;Let me drive,&#x201D; said Anders and took the reins. Then the horses reared up and jumped and then they could drive. After that, there has always been haunting at that farm. But that portal that they drove through has also been walled up and now the old house has been torn down.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Karl P&#xF8;lse p&#xE5; Asdal r&#xF6;vede meget ved stranden. Skibene lokkede han til land ved, n&#xE5;r det var h&#xE5;rdt vejr, at t&#xE6;nde blus oppe i t&#xE5;rnkammeret. Dette antog disse s&#xE5; for at v&#xE6;re Skagens fyr, og p&#xE5; den m&#xE5;de st&#xF6;dte mange skibe p&#xE5; grund ved Hirtshals. Om dagen tog Karl P&#xF8;lse til stranden for at se, om der var nogle strandede, og hvis dette var tilf&#xE6;ldet, tog han, hvad kostbarheder han fandt, og slog folkene ihjel. En gang var der strandet et skib, hvorfra en mand var kommen i land med en kiste. Manden s&#xE5; ud til at v&#xE6;re en gejstlig. Da Karl m&#xE6;rkede, at den fremmede passede s&#xE5; godt p&#xE5; kisten, troede han, at der var guld eller lignende i den. Han slog ham da ihjel og tog kisten med sig hjem for at f&#xE5; den brudt op. Da han fik den &#xE5;bnet, var der kun en kobberl&#xE6;nke i den. Karl P&#xF8;lse mente dog, at der var guld i, og smeden m&#xE5;tte s&#xE5; til at file p&#xE5; den, men lige meget hjalp det, kobber var det, og kobber blev det. Herover blev Karl P&#xF8;lse s&#xE5; vred, at han tog l&#xE6;nken og kastede den ud i borggraven. Men for ham var det, som l&#xE6;nken bandt ham, s&#xE5; han ikke kunde gj&#xF8;re noget. Han sendte da bud til pr&#xE6;sten Mads i Horne, som ogs&#xE5; kom derop og fik Karl l&#xF8;st af l&#xE6;nken, men denne m&#xE5;tte bygge et kapel for den beg&#xE5;ede synd, og det er den nuv&#xE6;rende Asdal kirke. Tillige fandt hr. Mads ud, at den l&#xE6;nke var den samme, som St. Peder havde v&#xE6;ret l&#xE6;nket i. Hr. Mads forb&#xF8;d tillige Karl P&#xF8;lse at r&#xF6;ve mere ved stranden, m&#xE5;ske for at han kunde f&#xE5; des mere selv. Karl blev dog lige godt ved, men s&#xE5; br&#xE6;ndte t&#xE5;rnet af en nat, da der var blevet fyret for st&#xE6;rkt p&#xE5; t&#xE5;rnkammeret. Da hr. Mads h&#xF8;rte det, tog han en dag ud til Karl P&#xF8;lse og fortalte ham, at dette var en straf fra himlen.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Karl P&#xF8;lse (Karl Sausage) robbed a lot along the beach. He lured the ships ashore by lighting a fire up in the tower room when it was bad weather. The sailors mistook this for Skagen's light and, in that manner, many ships ran aground off of Hirtshals. In the daytime, Karl P&#xF8;lse would go to the beach to see if there were any stranded people and, if there were, he took whatever valuables he found and killed the people. One time a ship stranded, and a man had come ashore from it with a chest. The man appeared to be a clergyman. When Karl noticed that the stranger was taking great care of the chest, he assumed that there was gold or the like inside it. He killed him and took the chest home in order to break it open. When he got it opened, there was only a copper chain link in it. But Karl P&#xF8;lse believed that there was gold inside it and the smith had to file on it, but it didn&#x2019;t help at all, since it was copper and remained copper. Karl P&#xF8;lse got so mad at this that he took the link and tossed it out into the pit. But for him, it was just like the chain link bound him, so he couldn&#x2019;t do anything. He sent for minister Mads from Horne, who also came out there and got Karl released from the chain link, but he had to build a chapel for the sin he&#x2019;d committed, and that&#x2019;s the current Asdal church. In addition, Mr. Mads found out that the chain link was the same one that St. Peter had been chained in. Mr. Mads forbade Karl P&#xF8;lse from robbing at the beach anymore, maybe so that he could get more for himself. Karl continued anyways, but then the tower burned down one night, since the fire had been built too big in the tower room. When Mr. Mads heard that, he went out to Karl P&#xF8;lse and told him that it was a punishment from heaven.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Hundslev ved Kjerteminde var der en ful heks. En gang kom der en pige til hende, som hun skulde helbrede for en sygdom, hvilket hun ogs&#xE5; gjorde. Da pigen var bleven helbredet, spurgte heksen hende, om hun ikke havde lyst til at l&#xE6;re heksekunsten, hvortil pigen svarede ja. Derp&#xE5; kom heksen med et harehoved p&#xE5; et fad, det skulde pigen kysse, ellers kunde hun ikke blive heks. Men endskj&#xF6;ndt harehovedet var skilt fra kroppen, gloede det dog s&#xE5; f&#xE6;lt, at pigen turde ikke kysse det, og det blev da ikke til noget med, at hun blev en heks.
      Derimod havde heksen en datter, som l&#xE6;rte kunsten af moderen. Et sted, hvor datteren tjente, havde de nogle sm&#xE5;b&#xF6;rn, som blev trukken i en lille vogn op og ned ad gulvet. Da sagde tjenestepigen, som jo var en heks, at hun kunde f&#xE5; vognen til at g&#xE5; af sig selv. S&#xE5; gav de, som trak den, slip, og nu l&#xF8;b vognen af sig selv op og ned ad gulvet. Til sidst kom den i en st&#xE6;rk fart, og pigen, der havde sat den i fart, kunde ikke standse den igjen; hun blev derfor angst og l&#xF8;b hjem til sin moder i Hundslev, og f&#xF8;rst da hun n&#xE5;ede hjem, standsede vognen.
      Den gamle heks gik en gang ude p&#xE5; Hindsholm ved herreg&#xE5;rden Hverringe, og hun fulgtes med en karl. Ved siden af vejen, hvor heksen og karlen gik, var herreg&#xE5;rdens marker, hvor de pl&#xF6;jede med syv plove. Heksen siger nu til karlen, at hun kunde f&#xE5; alle syv plove til at st&#xE5; stille p&#xE5; &#xE9;n gang. Det mente karlen var umuligt, men i samme &#xF6;jeblik stod de seks, den syvende derimod fortsatte pl&#xF6;jningen. Da spurgte karlen, hvordan det kunde v&#xE6;re, at den ene plov vedblev at pl&#xF6;je. Heksen svarede: "Det kommer af, at der er en flyver&#xF6;n i den, og derfor har jeg ingen magt over den."</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a full fledged witch in Hundslev near Kjerteminde. One time, a girl who she was to cure of a disease visited her and the witch cured her too. When the girl had been cured, the witch asked her if she didn't want to learn witchcraft, to which the girl answered yes. The witch then came with a hare's head on a platter and the girl was to kiss it, otherwise she couldn't become a witch. But even though the hare's head was detached from its body, it stared at her so horribly that the girl didn't dare kiss it, and so it didn't amount to anything with her becoming a witch. 
      In contrast, the witch had a daughter who learned the craft from her mother. They had small children at one of the places where the girl worked, and they were being pulled in a wagon across the floor. Then the girl, who was a witch, said that she could make the wagon go by itself. Then the ones who were pulling it let go and then the wagon drove back and forth on the floor. Finally, it started going really fast and the girl who had started it going couldn't stop it again; she got scared and ran home to her mother in Hundslev and the wagon didn't stop until she got home. 
      The old witch went out walking once on Hindsholm near Hverringe manor, and she was accompanied by a farmhand. Next to the road where the witch and the farmhand were walking were the manor's fields where they were plowing with seven plows. The witch now says to the farmhand that she could make all seven plows stand still all at once. The farmhand thought that that was impossible but, at that moment, six of the plows stood still, the seventh, by contrast, continued to plow. The farmhand asked why the one kept plowing. The witch answered, "That's because there's flying rowan in it, and so I don't have any power over it."</english_publication>

There was both music and dancing, and a troll came out with a large silver cup in his hands. The farmhand threw the wine away, but a drop fell on the horse's rump and burned both hair and hide away. He spurred the horse on, but the troll shouted, "Ride on the field up to the hillock!" When the troll reached the plowed field, he had to run back and forth as many times as the plow had gone there. When the farmhand got close to the church where the other farmhands were waiting for him, he shouted, "Open the church door!" Then he got in on consecrated ground. The troll threw his axe so far into the cemetery wall that it split, but he couldn't go any farther. That cup is still there at Karlslunde church.</english_publication>

Da havfruen s&#xE5; skulde drive kv&#xE6;get ud i havet, vendte hun sig om og sagde: "Nu, min r&#xF8;de tyr, nu kan du rode s&#xE5; meget du vil i bunden," hvilket den ogs&#xE5; gjorde, og deraf kommer flyvesandet.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Earlier, a mermaid, who lived in the Kattegat, let her twelve red cows and her red bull graze on the farmers&#x2019; fields. But then the farmers told the mermaid that she had to pay for the cows from then on. But she had nothing to pay with. Yes, they said, she had her belt, which shined of gold and silver. She gave that to them too, but it turned out to be nothing more than a rush. When the mermaid was to drive her cattle out to sea, she turned around and said: &#x201C;Now, my red bull, now you wander as much as you want on the bottom,&#x201D; which it did too, and that&#x2019;s where drifting sandbanks come from.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En mand her s&#xF8;nder ude, fra Hornum, havde solgt et par stude og skulde levere dem til en kromand i Vammen. Da han kommer der, sidder der en p&#xE6;n person inde i skj&#xE6;nkestuen, og han seer p&#xE5;, at manden fik studene udbetalt. S&#xE5; skulde de have et lidkj&#xF6;b, og den p&#xE6;ne person vilde have en puns med. Da de var f&#xE6;rdige med det, siger han: "Lad os f&#xE5; tre til, at jeg kan have noget at spytte af, n&#xE5;r jeg skal igjennem skoven." Lindum skov var nemlig i den tid ilde berygtet. S&#xE5; fulgtes de ad, og manden havde en forskr&#xE6;kkelig slem hund med sig. S&#xE5; siger den p&#xE6;ne person: "Vil den hund gj&#xF8;re nogen fortr&#xE6;d?" &#x2014; "Ja, du kan tro det," siger manden. S&#xE5; tr&#xE6;kker han en k&#xE5;rdestok og hugger hovedet af hunden. "Vil du nu udlevere pengene for studene?" Det var han villig til. Han t&#xE6;ller dem op til ham p&#xE5; en tr&#xE6;stub. "Men nu kan du gj&#xF8;re mig den tjeneste at hugge min h&#xF6;jre h&#xE5;nd af, for at min kone kan se, jeg har v&#xE6;ret imellem skidt folk. Men hug endelig h&#xE5;rdt til, at det ikke skal svirpe for h&#xE5;rdt." S&#xE5; hugger han, og den anden griber i det samme h&#xE5;nden til sig, s&#xE5; k&#xE5;rden s&#xE6;tter sig fast. R&#xF6;veren st&#xE5;r s&#xE5; og vil f&#xF8;le i lommen. Da griber den anden fat i ham og binder ham med hans hoseb&#xE5;nd. Dern&#xE6;st f&#xF8;ler han i r&#xF6;verens lommer og finder der en pibe, det var den, han vilde have bl&#xE6;st kammeraterne til sig med. "Vil du nu f&#xF8;lge med mig!" &#x2014; Nej, det vilde han ikke, og s&#xE5; gav han ham en 5, 6 over skrotten. Det hjalp, nu vilde han.

    <english_publication>A man from down south here, from Hornum, had sold a couple of steers and was to deliver them to an innkeeper in Vammen. When he gets there, there's a fine man sitting in the taproom, and he watches as the man got paid for the steers. Then they were going to drink on the deal, and the fine man wanted to have a toddy with them. When they were done with that, he said, "Let's have three more, so I can have something to spit with when I go through the forest." At the time, Lindum forest had a bad reputation. Then they accompanied each other, and the man had a really nasty dog with him. Then the fine man says: "Would that dog hurt anyone?"--"You bet it would," says the man. Then the fine man pulls out a rapier and chops the head off the dog. "Will you now give me the money for the steers?" He was willing to do that. He counts them out on a tree trunk. "But now you could do me the favor of chopping off my right hand so that my wife can see that I encountered some nasty people. But hit really hard so that it won't sting too much." Then he swings, but the other one pulls his hand back, so that the rapier gets stuck in the tree trunk. The robber stands there and reaches for something in his pocket. At that moment, the other one grabs him and ties him up with his stockings. Then he feels in the robber's pockets and finds a little whistle, that's what the robber was looking for to call his buddies. "Will you follow me now!" -- No, he wouldn't, so he smacked him five or six times, and that helped, now he'd come. They go to the parish bailiff and he admits that they were three robbers altogether. Then he shows them where the other two are, and all three of them are caught.</english_publication>

At the foot of the mound lay a peel board that was broken. He took it home and fixed it, after which he went over and placed it down in the same place where he&#x2019;d found it. Just before lunch, he went back out to the field to move and water the horses and there was a wonderful cake lying there; he got that because he had repaired the peel board. The mound woman had baked bread that morning. [Printed in an American magazine, Dannebrog]</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There had been a harsh storm on the North Sea and many ships had nearly foundered. When it eventually became better weather, two ships met out on the sea and came so close to each other, that the people could shout to each other about where they came from and where their home harbor was and so on. At the same time, they hear that two nisser are shouting to each other from the tops of the masts, one on each ship, about how they had fared during the storm. The first one said: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve had enough to do holding the jib stay, otherwise the mast would have fallen down.&#x201D; When the people looked up to see about the voice, the nisse let go of the stay, which immediately fell down on deck, and he started to laugh hysterically. Now the people had something else to think about than to look for the nisse, because the mast nearly fell overboard. While they were busy getting the mast set again, the nisse saw his chance to take off down into the hold where they couldn&#x2019;t find him.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There used to be talk that if a farmhand took the skin that the foal lies in when a mare foals (the placenta) and walks through it, he could turn into a wolf. There was a farmhand who had done it, and then he and his master were in the meadow haying. Then it came over him, and he turned into a wolf, and he went over and ripped the foal to death and tore a big part off of it. A little later he came back and turned into a farmhand again and lay down next to the master and complained that he didn&#x2019;t feel good, at which point the man said: &#x201C;No wonder, since you&#x2019;ve torn my foal apart.&#x201D;

Man tog en gren af et tr&#xE6;, som egnede sig for det, og s&#xE5; skulde der hugges tre hug p&#xE5; den tre torsdag morgener i tr&#xE6;k, to hug &#xE6;for og &#xE9;t &#xE6;bag hver gang, og n&#xE5;r de tre torsdag morgener var g&#xE5;et, og de ni hug udf&#xF8;rte, skulde bladet v&#xE6;re f&#xE6;rdigt. Min fader gik til en mand og vilde have ham til at lave den spade. Ja, det vilde han godt. "Men a skal hugge de tre hug hver dag i Fandens navn, og det vil a ogs&#xE5; godt gj&#xF8;re. Dern&#xE6;st skal a i de tre uger l&#xE6;gge mig og rejse mig i Fandens navn." Da min fader h&#xF8;rte det, sagde han: "Det vil a mins&#xE6;l ikke have dig til." S&#xE5; blev der alts&#xE5; ikke noget ud af det arbejde.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was old talk of a spade that was made with nine blows and when you put it down at night it would be moved to the place where gold is supposed to be buried and then you could dig it up. That kind of spade was made of wood and if there was a knot, it could remain and be used as a foot tread. You took a tree branch which could be used for that, and then you were supposed to cut three blows on it three Thursdays in a row, two blows in the front and one in the back each time, and when the three Thursdays had passed, and the nine blows finished, the blade was supposed to be finished. My father went to a man and wanted to have a spade like that made. Well, he&#x2019;d do that. &#x201C;But I have to cut the three blows each day in the name of the devil, and I&#x2019;ll gladly do that. Then after that I&#x2019;ll have to go to bed and get up for the three weeks in the name of the devil." When my father heard that, he said: &#x201C;I certainly don&#x2019;t want to have you do that." So nothing came of that work.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Den gang den sorte pest rasede her, da d&#xF8;de de alle p&#xE5; Hjarn&#xF8; s&#xE5; n&#xE6;r som &#xE9;n, og det var en gammel kone, der blev tilbage. Hun havde n&#xE6;r aldrig f&#xE5;et de d&#xF8;de begravet, for hun var b&#xE5;de gammel og svag. Endelig kom der folk over til &#xF8;en, og det f&#xF8;rste de s&#xE5; efter var, om de kunde finde ler til at bygge huse af. Der var efter pesten mange byer, hvor der ikke var et menneske i. Men s&#xE5; fandt nogle p&#xE5; at t&#xE6;nde b&#xE5;l om natten for at finde hverandre. Mange gik til kirke eller i marken eller byen, men d&#xF8;de, inden de kom hjem. Sygdommen kom med en nysen, og n&#xE5;r den syge havde nyst tre gange var han d&#xF8;d. Liget blev straks sort, og derfor fik pesten navnet af den sorte d&#xF8;d. Siden den tid har det v&#xE6;ret skik at sige til den, der nyser: Gud velsigne dig.
     Jeg har ogs&#xE5; h&#xF8;rt fort&#xE6;lle, at den, der gravede grave p&#xE5; B&#xE5;rup kirkeg&#xE5;rd, kunde st&#xE5; og se, n&#xE5;r de kom med et lig ovre ved Klejs by (i samme sogn) og s&#xE5; endda selv komme f&#xF8;rst i graven, alts&#xE5; forend liget, de kom med fra Klejs.  </danish_publication>
    <english_publication>During the time when the plague raged here, all the people on Hjan island died except for one, and that was an old woman who was left. She was almost unable to get all the dead buried since she was both old and weak. Finally people came over to the island, and the first thing they looked for was to see if they could find clay to build houses out of. After the plague, there were a lot of villages in which there wasn&#x2019;t a single person. But then some figured out that they could light fires at night to find each other. A lot went off to church or to work in the fields or to town but died before they got home. The sickness started with sneezing, and when the sick person had sneezed three times, he was dead. The corpse quickly became black, and therefore the plague got the name the black death. Since that time, it's been the custom to say to someone who sneezes: God bless you. 
     I also heard told that the person who dug graves at R&#xE5;rup cemetery could stand and see when they came with a corpse from Klejs village (in the same parish) and then get to the grave first before the corpse they were bringing from Klejs.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I fjor i november m&#xE5;ned, klokken var imellem 4 og 5 om morgenen, og det var ikke s&#xE5; m&#xF8;rkt, da der var nogle stj&#xE6;rner ude, gik jeg ud til J. Jensen for at slagte en gris for ham. Da kom min hund, lige som jeg kom ud for den &#xF6;stre kirkeg&#xE5;rdsl&#xE5;ge og n&#xE6;sten t&#xE6;t til Skjold skole, l&#xF8;bende hen imellem mine ben og peb. Jeg s&#xE5; mig omkring for at vide, hvad der var i vejen med den, og da s&#xE5; jeg en h&#xF6;j hvid skikkelse komme ud af kirkeg&#xE5;rdsl&#xE5;gen og dreje ind efter brugsforeningen, samt vesten om huset. Det gik en almindelig j&#xE6;vn gang. Jeg gik s&#xE5; nogle f&#xE5; skridt for at se, hvor skikkelsen gik hen, men da var der ikke nogen ting at se. Straks t&#xE6;nkte jeg ved mig selv, at der skulde nok snart &#xE9;n d&#xF8;. Jeg gik s&#xE5; ind i huset, for konen der vilde med hen til samme mand. Da lyset blev t&#xE6;ndt, blev jeg s&#xE5; underlig til mode, jeg var ved at blive syg, men jeg talte ikke om noget den gang. S&#xE5;dant noget har jeg set tit. </danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Last year in November, it was between four and five o&#x2019;clock in the morning, and it wasn&#x2019;t too dark, since there were some stars out, I went over to J. Jensen to slaughter a pig for him. So then my dog came running, just as I passed by the east cemetery gate really close to Skjold school, he came running between my legs and whimpered. I looked around to find out what was wrong with him, and then I saw a tall white shape come out of the cemetery gate and turn in beyond the cooperative store, around the west side of the house. It had a normal, even gait. I went a few steps to see where the shape was going, but then there was nothing to see. Immediately I thought that somebody there would die soon. So I went into the house, since the woman there was going off to the same man. When the light was lit, I had such a strange feeling and I was just about to get sick, but I didn&#x2019;t say anything at that time. I&#x2019;ve seen things like that often.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Der var en kr&#xE6;mmer eller Hamborger-J&#xF8;de, der gik p&#xE5; egnen, og han blev slagen ihjel. Det var her i Obbestrup, Gunderup sogn, det passeret, og kr&#xE6;mmeren han vilde til N&#xF6;vling. Der f&#xE5;r han en karl til at f&#xF8;lge med sig og vise ham vej, og s&#xE5; slog karlen ham ihjel og ber&#xF6;vede ham, hvad han havde. Inden han fik ham af med livet, s&#xE5; kom der syv gr&#xE5;gj&#xE6;s flyvende. S&#xE5; siger J&#xF8;den: "De skal v&#xE6;re mit vidne til, at du sl&#xE5;r mig ihjel." Karlen r&#xF6;mte s&#xE5; hans vej og var bort i 20 &#xE5;r, kom derefter til den samme g&#xE5;rd, hvor han havde tjent, men de kjendte ham ikke. Da var han jo bleven en sv&#xE6;r rig hestepranger, og det var om h&#xF6;sten, han kom der. De forlangede ham til at h&#xF8;ste med dem, og det gjorde han ogs&#xE5;. S&#xE5; h&#xF6;stede de p&#xE5; det sted, hvor han havde begravet J&#xF8;den. Da kommer deher 7 gr&#xE5;gj&#xE6;s &#xF6;ster fra og tr&#xE6;kker til vest, og s&#xE5; siger konen: "Gudbevares, gr&#xE5;gj&#xE6;ssene kommer s&#xE5; tidlig, a er bange for, de skal &#xE6;de havren." Men der var en gasse iblandt, og han siger til prangeren: "Der, som du g&#xE5;r, der har du sl&#xE5;et St.-Peder ihjel." S&#xE5; bekjendte prangeren med det samme, og han blev rettet p&#xE5; den plads, som han havde begravet den anden, og han blev ogs&#xE5; kast i jorden p&#xE5; samme plads. P&#xE5; det sted groede ingen ting, det kunde v&#xE6;re det samme, hvad de s&#xE5;ede, der vilde ingen ting gro. Det er en &#xF8;de plads kanske den dag i dag er.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a peddler or a Hamburg-Jew, who walked about the area and he was killed. It was here in Obbestrup, Gunderup parish that it happened and the peddler was on his way to N&#xF8;vling. The peddler gets a farmhand to come along with him from there to show him the way, and then the farmhand kills him and robbed him of what he had. Before the farmhand killed the Jew, seven gray geese flew by. Then the Jew says: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll be my witness, that you killed me.&#x201D; The farmhand then ran away and was gone for twenty years. Then he came back to the same farm where he'd worked, but they didn&#x2019;t recognize him. At that point he had become a really rich horse trader and it was at harvest time that he arrived. They asked him to help them harvest and he did. Then they harvested on the place where he had buried the Jew. Then these seven gray geese come from the east and go towards the west and then the wife says, &#x201C;God save us, the gray geese are coming too early, I&#x2019;m afraid they&#x2019;ll eat the oats.&#x201D; But there was a gander among them and he says to the horse dealer: &#x201C;There where you&#x2019;re walking, that&#x2019;s where you killed St. Peder.&#x201D; Then the horse dealer admitted it on the spot and he was executed on the spot where he had earlier buried the other one, and he was also thrown into the ground in the same place. Nothing grew on that place, it didn&#x2019;t matter what they planted, nothing would grow there. It&#x2019;s still a barren place to this day.</english_publication>

Han fort&#xE6;ller s&#xE5; pr&#xE6;sten det, og pr&#xE6;sten sp&#xF6;rger folk, om der var ingen, der kunde huske, hvem der var bleven begravet der.

Pr&#xE6;sten fik s&#xE5; hovedet bundet i et t&#xF6;rkl&#xE6;de, og s&#xE5; fulgtes han og et par m&#xE6;nd ad derud. Da de kommer ind, siger han til hende, om hun kjendte ikke det hoved. Jo, s&#xE5; bekjendte hun med det samme og gjorde rede for hele tildragelsen, og hvordan hun havde gjort det. S&#xE5; blev hun kj&#xF8;rt til Aalborg og sat ind p&#xE5; r&#xE5;dstuen.

    <english_publication>This happened down in Ferslev, a peddler wound up spending the night. As he was lying there in the bed, with his head resting on one side, the farmer's wife goes and puts a ladle they had on the fire and melts lead in it and pours the lead down in his ear. He dies and is buried, and they keep the things the peddler had. It goes like this for a while, and then the grave is dug up again. The gravedigger puts the head aside, because it was so heavy and he could see the lead in the head. He tells the minister about it, and the minister asks people if anyone could remember who had been buried there. Then there was a really old woman, she says that in such and such a farm, a peddler had gotten lodgings, and he had died suddenly that night. Then the minister asks if anyone from that farm who was there when the peddler had come was still alive. Yes, the woman was still alive, she was a pensioner. The minister wrapped the skull in a scarf and then he followed along with a couple of men out there. When they come in, he asks her if she didn't know that head. Well, she confessed immediately and explained the whole event and how she'd done it. Then she was driven to Aalborg and put in the courthouse. The next morning she was dead, but how she'd died, there were no questions about that.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Lund i Sk&#xE5;ne var der altid sjov og spektakler i kirken, og stolene de l&#xE5; og var v&#xE6;lt. Pr&#xE6;sten han kunde ikke komme ind p&#xE5;, hvordan det kunde v&#xE6;re, og vilde gj&#xE6;rne have det opdaget. Men han turde ikke selv v&#xE6;re i kirken og opdage det. S&#xE5; var der en fattig skomager i byen, ham byder han en stor betaling for at g&#xE5; der op og v&#xE6;re der en nat. Ja, det vilde skomageren ogs&#xE5; godt g&#xE5; ind p&#xE5;, men han vilde have et lys med sig, og s&#xE5; vilde han have pr&#xE6;sten til at skrive Herrens b&#xF6;n i en stor krinds runden om sig, og s&#xE5; m&#xE5;tte han ikke g&#xE5; ud, inden pr&#xE6;sten han kom og sagde: "Kom s&#xE5; i Jesu Kristi navn." Han vilde jo sidde og skomagerere inden i den krinds. Straks da han var kommen i kirken og havde begyndt p&#xE5; arbejdet, s&#xE5; kommer der &#xE9;n, som lignede pr&#xE6;sten. Han siger: "Kom i navn." Nej, han gik ikke, for Guds navn det var jo ikke med. Omsider s&#xE5; kom der s&#xE5; mange i kirke, og der var en pr&#xE6;st, der tr&#xE5;dte op p&#xE5; pr&#xE6;kestolen. Der kom nu flere pr&#xE6;ster til skomageren og sagde: "Kom i navn." Han vilde ikke uden kredsen og blev siddende. Endelig langt om l&#xE6;nge s&#xE5; kom de og vilde s&#xE6;lge ham et skind. Da r&#xE6;kker han hans kj&#xE6;p ud, der skulde de l&#xE6;gge skindet &#xE6;p&#xE5;, og s&#xE5; fik han det ind til sig. Anden dagen s&#xE5; kom pr&#xE6;sten og sagde: "Kom s&#xE5; i Jesu Kristi navn." Nu var han ikke r&#xE6;d for at f&#xF8;lge med. S&#xE5; viste han pr&#xE6;sten det skind, og det var af en d&#xF8;dning. Skindet det blev f&#xE6;st p&#xE5; kirked&#xF6;ren, og s&#xE5; holdt spektaklet op.

    <english_publication>There was always fun and games in the church in Lund in Sk&#xE5;ne, and the chairs lay about, all knocked over. The minister could not figure out what it could be, and wanted to discover what was doing it. But he didn't dare stay in the church himself and discover what it was. Then there was a poor cobbler in the town, he offers him a big payment if he would go up there and stay the night. Well, the cobbler said he was willing to do that, but he wanted a candle with him, and then he wanted the minister to write the Lord's prayer in a big circle around him, and then he wasn't to leave the circle until the minister came and said, "Come now in Jesus Christ's name." He intended to sit inside the circle and cobble. As soon as he'd gotten into the church and started working, someone comes who looks like the minister. He says, "Come in name." No, he wouldn't go, because God's name hadn't been there. A little while later, so many came into the church, and there was a minister who went up to the pulpit. Now more ministers came up to the cobbler and said, "Come in name." He wouldn't leave the circle and stayed sitting there. Finally, they came and wanted to sell him a hide. Then he reaches out with his staff, they were to put the hide on that, and then he pulled it in to where he was. The next day, the minister came and said, "Come now in Jesus Christ's name." Now he wasn't scared of following him. Then he showed the minister the hide and it was that of a corpse. The hide was attached to the church door, and then the haunting stopped. But they couldn't totally rebuild the church anyway, there were some stones they couldn't get to lie correctly.</english_publication>

Then there was a daring farmhand from the town who wanted to go up and give him a sandwich, but then Skaris jumps on his back and rides him down through the town. When they got down to the east, past the town, then Skaris flew off of him and into a house, and then there was a huge row in the house. Skaris disappeared completely in there, there was nothing to see of him in there. After that time, there was haunting in that house. It was later torn down since nobody wanted it, and the garden was later attached to a farm.</english_publication>

Some men from the area once tried to dig it up, and they had also gotten hold of the kettle, which was filled with money, and they had gotten it up to the edge of the hole, which they had dug, but then one of them couldn&#x2019;t stay quiet any longer because of his happiness over the unbelievable amount of money that there had to be in the kettle. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s tremendous how heavy this thing is!&#x201D; he said, and as soon as that was said, the kettle fell away from them and sank far deeper than it had been before, and they had to go home with empty hands. People living now have seen lights burning on the castle courtyard, and since the light probably burns over the treasure, it should be possible to find it even now.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A farmhand who was seriously plagued by nightmares got the hired boy to help him one night. He blocked all the holes into the room except for one because the mare was supposed to come in through it, he thought. Then the boy was to get up when he noticed something was wrong and block that hole too. Then he was to call to the farmhand so he could come to himself again. The boy did this too, and in the morning there was a girl with them in the bed. Nobody knew her and she didn&#x2019;t know where she had come from or anything else for that matter. The farmhand was the son of the farm owner and he married the girl and inherited the farm and they had a lot of kids together. Then one day he wanted to show her the hole that she had come in through and then she scooted back out of it and he never saw her again.</english_publication>

They dug and all sorts of things appeared, first a dog, and he ran and hopped a long time, but they continued to dig. Finally, they got close to the treasure, and then a large red rooster came up. They had gotten hold of the chest and were in the process of heaving it up out of the hole. The rooster ran about and did all sorts of tricks and then it let loose a huge fart. Then one of the men says: &#x201C;That was one helluva fart for a rooster." Then it was over. People dug a bit in some mounds not too far from there, which are called Klovnh&#xF8;je, they thought that the rooster had run off over there with the treasure, and so they started there.

    <danish_publication>Der var en gang en amtmand i Skanderborg, der hed Grabe, han lavede jo og mange kunster, te folk var ikke tjente med. Da han var d&#xF8;d, var de ham derfor ikke ledig i Skanderborg, han drog jo omkring og gjorde dem besv&#xE6;rlighed p&#xE5; sine tider. S&#xE5; skulde de jo til at sagne over om at have ham manet, og de fik fat i Slanter-Lavst fra Blegind, som folk brugte meget i den tid, og da han kom og fik at vide sammenh&#xE6;ngen af det hele, sagde han: "Ja, han er farlig og ikke nem at gj&#xF8;re det ved; men jeg kan jo nok standse ham noget." De kunde da drage ud i Dyrehaven og finde en afkrog, han kunde gjemme ham i. Men da nu pr&#xE6;sten havde udtalt sig om, at han var s&#xE5; farlig, kom nogle Skanderborgere i tanker om, at de var ham vel ikke kvit, n&#xE5;r han var s&#xE5; n&#xE6;r ved dem.

    <english_publication>There was once an old district governor in Skanderborg, who was called Grabe, and he did all sorts of black arts that people weren&#x2019;t too happy about. When he was dead, they weren&#x2019;t free of him in Skanderborg, he wandered about and made difficulties some times. Then they decided to have him conjured, and they got hold of Slanter-Laust from Blegind, people used him a lot in those days, and when he came and found out about how it all hung together, he said: &#x201C;Well, he&#x2019;s dangerous and not easy to deal with; but I can probably stop him a bit.&#x201D; They had to go out into the park and find an out-of-the-way place where they could hide him away. But now, since the minister had declared that he was that dangerous, people realized they hadn&#x2019;t gotten rid of him since he was so close by. Then he asks if there&#x2019;s anybody who knows the area well, where it would be the most difficult for the district governor to ride or however else he&#x2019;d be traveling about. Then there were a couple of guys who&#x2019;d been out here with the royal huntsmen a couple of times on T&#xE5;ning field, and they thought it would be difficult out there and then Grabe was to be put down there. That water hole isn&#x2019;t too far from here and it&#x2019;s an incredibly large depression which at that time was completely inaccessible. Grabe drives out there with four black horses in front of his carriage, back and forth.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Down here to the north there was a smith's wife and their journeyman smith who had become good friends. Then they wanted to get the smith out of the way, and they figured out an easy way to get rid of him: the journeyman made a large nail and said that he'd drive it into the man's head. They did it too, while the smith lay sleeping. She held the nail and he hit with the hammer. The whole thing went quietly and well. Twenty years later, the same gravedigger, who had dug the smith's grave, happened to dig him up again and found his head. Then the head of the nail could be seen, it was sticking out of the skull. He thinks over the affair, and realizes that the smith was buried there. So he goes to the minister and reports what he has discovered. He says, "Bring the head here,"-- the parsonage was in town right next to the church. Then the minister puts the head in his room and sends for the woman. "How long ago is it that your previous husband died?" -- "Oh, well it\s probably twenty years ago."--"Is it that long ago? Would you recognize him if you saw him?"--"Yes, I certainly could." Then the minister took the cloth off the skull and showed it to her. "Yes, that's right enough." she says. "What happened with that nail?" Well, she told him everything and they were punished, and were executed, both the woman and the journeyman.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>An old couple lived many years ago at the farm Torsmark near Br&#xF8;nderslev, and they loved each other so much that they wished that neither should survive the other. They also had their wish fulfilled, since they both died at the same time. But, nevertheless, after they'd died, one saw them walk arm in arm up the road which went from the cemetery to Torsmark, the doors in the farm opened as if by themselves and they strolled in, clothed in long white clothes. In the bedroom they stopped by the door, the same way they came in. The owner of the farm had the minister fetched so they could find out from the revenants what they were looking for and when they appeared one night, the minister addressed them with these words: &#x201C;My soul praises God,&#x201D; at which point they both answered, &#x201C;Mine does too.&#x201D; &#x201C;What are you walking here for then?&#x201D; asked the minister. The wife began to speak and said that she had hidden twenty-four twenty-four shilling coins (576 shillings) in a sock tree which was hidden under the bed. &#x201C;When you lift the big stone which is loose,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;then you&#x2019;ll find the treasure.&#x201D; At which point they both disappeared. The next day they looked under the bed and found the money sure enough, just as the dead woman had said. From that point on, the two old people had peace in the grave, since no one ever saw them walk to the farm to repeat their nightly visit.</english_publication>

Der fort&#xE6;lles om ham, at han var synsk, han kunde se inden i et menneske, hvad der befandt sig, s&#xE5; snart han fik det at se, samt kunde sige, hvad der skulde ske i fremtiden. Han skal selv have fortalt, at han fik sin visdom p&#xE5; f&#xF8;lgende m&#xE5;de. Mens han var en lille dreng, h&#xE6;ndte det sig en dag, at han noget sulten kom hjem fra marken, og da han ingen mennesker fandt i huset, gik han selv ind i spisekammeret for at lave sig en meldmad. Han fik derved &#xF6;je p&#xE5; en krukke, som stod p&#xE5; en af hylderne, hvori der var noget dejlig, velsmagende fedt, som han spiste til et stykke br&#xF8;d. Men da hans moder kom hjem og straks savnede fedtet i krukken, spurgte hun ham, om han havde spist det, hvortil han svarede ja. "Det m&#xE5;tte du ikke have gjort," og nu fortalte hun ham, at fedtet var af en stor, hvid hugorm, der var hugormenes konge. Moderen m&#xE5;tte alts&#xE5; finde sig i, at s&#xF6;nnen kom i besiddelse af den egenskab, hun havde tilt&#xE6;nkt sig selv.

    <english_publication>Not too many years ago, a man lived in Vendsyssel who went by the name &#x201C;Hals minister.&#x201D; It was said about him that he was gifted with foresight, he could see what there was inside a person and, as soon he saw that, he could also say what would happen in the future. He was supposed to have said that he got his wisdom in the following way: When he was a little boy it happened one day that he came home hungry from the field and when he didn&#x2019;t find any people at home, he went into the dining room by himself to make himself a sandwich. A small pot that was standing on one of the shelves caught his eye, in it was some wonderfully tasty fat, and he ate it on a piece of bread. But when his mother came home, she immediately missed the fat in the pot, she asked him if he&#x2019;d eaten it, to which he answered yes. &#x201C;You shouldn&#x2019;t have done that,&#x201D; and now she told him that the fat was from a big white viper, it was the king of the vipers. 
     In the olden days, when there were far more vipers than there are now days, the shepherds who watched the cattle out on the bog often saw viper nests. The vipers sat in there in a moss tussock in an uncountable mass and stuck their heads into the air and in the middle of the nest there was one, much bigger than the others, with a white head and that was the viper king.</english_publication>

They managed with great difficulty to get her home and there she told them that a wonderfully nice man had come to her by the alder swamp and asked her if she would be his lover, and with his speech he&#x2019;d entranced her so she couldn&#x2019;t get away from him. He had also entranced her so she couldn&#x2019;t answer when the other girls called to her. After that, she had to go down to the alder swamp each time they went out, but one time somebody advised her that when the elf king came again she should say to him three times, &#x201C;Turn around so I can see if you're the same in back as in front.&#x201D; She did that the next time and when she now saw that he was hollow in the back, she cried out: &#x201C;No, damn it, you&#x2019;re as hollow as a dough trough!&#x201D; at which point he deserted her and, after that time, she had peace from him.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Der var en pr&#xE6;st ovre i Angel, han havde Cyprianus. S&#xE5; kom der en dreng hen og skulde undervises hos ham, og han hed Jakob. En dag sad pr&#xE6;sten og l&#xE6;ste, da listede drengen sig hen og l&#xE6;ste bag ved ham i bogen. S&#xE5; spurgte pr&#xE6;sten, om han havde lyst til at l&#xE6;re det, der stod. Ja, det vilde han gjerne. S&#xE5; l&#xE6;rte han ham ogs&#xE5;, og det var netop af Cyprianus. En dag pr&#xE6;sten var i kirke, fik han selv fat p&#xE5; den og gav sig til l&#xE6;se p&#xE5; egen h&#xE5;nd. Da kom der en ugle ind i kammeret, og kort efter en anden og s&#xE5; flere, og de fl&#xF6;j omkring i v&#xE6;relset. Han blev ved at l&#xE6;se, og da kom der en tusse hoppende ind, s&#xE5; nok &#xE9;n, og til sidst var der en hel flok. Da de var v&#xE6;k, og han blev ved med l&#xE6;sningen, kom der snoge, og det blev ogs&#xE5; til en hel m&#xE6;ngde. Imens stod pr&#xE6;sten p&#xE5; stolen, men da lagde han m&#xE6;rke til, at der j&#xE6;vnlig kom en ugle flyvende uden for. Han kunde forst&#xE5;, at der m&#xE5;tte v&#xE6;re noget galt p&#xE5; f&#xE6;rde der hjemme, og han skyndte sig det bedste han kunde og kom hjem i studerekammeret, netop som den hele flok snoge kom vrimlende. Drengen havde nu af forskr&#xE6;kkelse lagt bogen og vidste ikke, hvor han skulde gj&#xF8;re af sig selv. Pr&#xE6;sten s&#xE5; jo straks, hvad der var ved det, og begyndte at l&#xE6;se tilbage, s&#xE5; de da atter blev fordrevne. Pr&#xE6;sten sagde nu, at han kunde takke sin Gud for, han var kommen s&#xE5; tidlig, for hvis snogene var forsvundne, s&#xE5; var trolden selv kommen, og s&#xE5; havde der intet r&#xE5;d v&#xE6;ret for ham. Nu vilde han l&#xE6;re ham, hvordan det skulde g&#xE5; til at l&#xE6;se dem tilbage.
     Drengen blev ved at v&#xE6;re ved pr&#xE6;sten og fik bogen efter ham, men &#xE6; kan ikke huske at gj&#xF8;re rede for, hvordan han brugte den.
     Da Jakob han blev gammel, kunde han f&#xE5; Fanden til at vise sig, n&#xE5;r han vilde have det. En dag bad s&#xF6;nnen, om han ikke m&#xE5;tte f&#xE5; ham at se. Da stod de en dag ude ved vejen og grov, og s&#xE5; siger Jakob til ham, at han skulde passe p&#xE5;, for i eftermiddag kom han her forbi. S&#xE5; kom der da forskjellige og gik forbi, og til sidst kom der en fin herre. Da han var lige forbi, sagde den gamle: "S&#xE5; du ham?" &#x2014; "Ja, hvem? &#x2014; "Ham, du vilde have at se." &#x2014; Ja, hvor er han?" &#x2014; "S&#xE5; du ikke, han gik her forbi." S&#xE5; vendte han sig rask om, men da var der ingen at se.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a minister over in Angel, he had a Cyprianus. Then a boy came and was to be instructed by him, and he was called Jakob. One day the minister sat and read, and the boy sneaked up behind him and read behind him in the book. Then the minister asked if he wanted to learn what was written there. Yes, he wanted to. Then he taught him that it was in fact from the Cyprianus. One day when the minister was in the church, Jakob started in on it himself and started to read on his own. Then an owl came into the room and soon after another and then more, and they flew about in the room. He continued to read and then a toad came hopping into the room, then another and finally there was a whole flock. When they were gone and he continued reading, grass snakes came in and that also turned into a huge mass of snakes. In the meantime, the minister stood at the pulpit, but then he noticed that an owl came flying by with regularity outside. He realized that there must be something wrong happening at home and he hurried as best he could to get home and he got home and went into the study, just as the whole nest of grass snakes came slithering in. The boy had, out of fright, put the book down and didn&#x2019;t know what he should do with himself. The minister saw immediately what was going on and started to read back so they were driven away once more. The minister said now that he should thank God that he came early because, if the snakes had disappeared, then the troll himself would have come and then there would have been no helping him. Now he would teach him how one could go about reading them away. 
      The boy continued to live with the minister and got the book after him, but I can&#x2019;t remember how he used it. 
      When Jakob got old, he could get the devil to show himself whenever he wanted to see him. One day his son asked if he couldn&#x2019;t see him. Then they were out one day standing by a road and digging and then Jakob says to him that he should watch out because that afternoon the devil would walk by. Then different people came and walked by and finally a high class gentleman came by. Just when he had passed, the old one said: &#x201C;Did you see him?&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, who?&#x201D; &#x201C;Him, the one you wanted to see.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, where is he?&#x201D; &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you see, he walked past here.&#x201D; Then he turned around quickly, but then there was nobody to see.</english_publication>

Det var, som om kreaturerne vidste, n&#xE5;r den var kommen, for de blev som helt t&#xE5;belige, s&#xE5; snart den havde st&#xF6;dt porten op. H&#xF8;vederne, der stod bundne i stalden, sled i bidslerne og br&#xF6;lede, som de var rent tossede, og kunde nogle af dem rive sig l&#xF8;s, gjorde de det og l&#xF8;b ud af g&#xE5;rden. Efter at det var g&#xE5;et s&#xE5;dan et par n&#xE6;tter, var der ingen, der vilde bo der, og de kreaturer, der ikke blev flyttede, d&#xF8;de i b&#xE5;sene. Manden havde sagt, at den Slemme godt m&#xE5;tte komme og hente ham, og var i det hele s&#xE5; slem til at bande. Derfor mente de, at det var den Slemme, der tumlede der.

    <english_publication>A man in the farm in N&#xF8;rup hanged himself and, after they had gotten him buried, there was nobody who would live in the farm because every night, as soon as the sun had gone down, a black dog came and just touched the door so that it sprung open. Then it ran through the house from one end to the other and knocked the doors open. It was as if the cattle knew when it came because they got restless as soon as it had knocked the door open. The cattle that were tied up in the barn tore at their bits and mooed as if they were completely crazy, and if any of them could tear themselves free, they would and run out of the farm. After a couple of nights like that, there was nobody who would stay there and those animals that weren&#x2019;t moved died in their stalls. The man had said that the Evil One could come and get him; he was really bad about swearing in general. Therefore they believed that it was the Evil One who tumbled about in there. They had to tear the farm down and move it out onto the field, and since then they didn&#x2019;t see anything more of the black dog.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En pr&#xE6;stedatter i Borre skulde have v&#xE6;ret hemmelig forlovet med kusken og bleven med barn ved ham. Da pr&#xE6;sten opdagede dette forhold, tvang han kusken til at kj&#xF8;re hende til Kj&#xF6;benhavn. De kom da s&#xE5; afsted, blev sat over med f&#xE6;rgen fra Koster og kom et godt stykke ind p&#xE5; Sj&#xE6;lland. S&#xE5; blev pigen imidlertid syg og skulde f&#xF8;de, og kusken vilde derfor kj&#xF8;re ind i en g&#xE5;rd ved vejen; men pigens broder, som ogs&#xE5; var med, tog linerne fra ham og kj&#xF8;rte videre trods s&#xF8;sterens ver&#xE5;b, indtil hun d&#xF8;de p&#xE5; vejen. Nu m&#xE5;tte han da vende om og give sig p&#xE5; hjemvejen; men da han og kusken kom hjem, havde pigen allerede l&#xE6;nge v&#xE6;ret hjemme, og siden kunde man i lang tid se hende g&#xE5; omkring i pr&#xE6;steg&#xE5;rden, som mens hun levede, indtil hun endelig blev manet ned i kj&#xE6;lderen, og der blev rammet en p&#xE6;l igjennem hende. En for nylig afd&#xF8;d gammel kone har fortalt mig, at i hendes ungdom havde hun tit set p&#xE6;len, som stod nedrammet i kj&#xE6;ldergulvet, og ingen turde r&#xF8;re den, s&#xE5; den st&#xE5;r der sandsynligvis endnu, hvis folk ikke er blevne mere dristige siden den tid.
     Samme kone fortalte tit, at den gang hun tjente som stuepige i Borre pr&#xE6;steg&#xE5;rd, havde pr&#xE6;sten her en kapellan ved navn Engelsted, som kunde meget mere end pr&#xE6;sterne i vore dage, og den sorte bog havde han da ogs&#xE5;. En s&#xF8;ndag, medens kapellanen var i kirken for at forrette gudstjenesten, og hun kom ind i hans v&#xE6;relse for at gj&#xF8;re rent, gav hun sig til at kikke lidt i en bog, der l&#xE5; p&#xE5; bordet, og da hun f&#xF8;rst havde begyndt, kunde hun ikke holde op igjen, men m&#xE5;tte blive ved at l&#xE6;se med stadig stigende iver og interesse. Hun havde imidlertid ikke l&#xE6;st ret l&#xE6;nge, f&#xF6;rend kapellanen kom farende ind og rev bogen fra hende, idet han gav hende &#xE9;n p&#xE5; &#xF8;ret og sagde: "Hvad vilde du have grebet til, hvis 'den gamle' var kommen!" og derp&#xE5; satte han sig selv til at l&#xE6;se i bogen, rimeligvis for at holde 'den gamle' borte. Men siden fik hun at vide, at kapellanen havde brudt af, sagt amen og var rendt ned af pr&#xE6;dikestolen og hjem, inden han var halvt f&#xE6;rdig med sin pr&#xE6;diken, s&#xE5; han m&#xE5;tte jo p&#xE5; en eller anden m&#xE5;de kunne m&#xE6;rke, at der var noget galt p&#xE5; f&#xE6;rde der hjemme.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A minister&#x2019;s daughter in Borre was secretly engaged with the driver and had gotten pregnant by him. When the minister discovered this relationship, he forced the driver to drive her to Copenhagen. They started off then, were brought over by the ferry from Koster and had gotten a good ways into Sj&#xE6;lland. Then the girl gets sick and is going to give birth, and so the driver wants to drive into a farm along the road; but the girl&#x2019;s brother, who was also along, took the reins from him and continued driving despite his sister&#x2019;s labor screams, and she finally died on the road. Now he had to turn around and start on the road home; but when he and the driver got home, the girl had already been home for a long time, and after that one could see her walking around the parsonage just like when she was alive, until she was finally conjured down in the cellar, and they drove a post through her. An old woman who recently died told me that, in her youth, she had often seen the post, which was driven into the cellar floor and nobody dared to touch it, so it's likely still there unless people have become more daring since that time. 
     The same woman often told that when she was working as a hired girl at Borre parsonage, the minister had a chaplain with the name Engelsted who could do a lot more than the ministers today, and he also had the black book. One Sunday, while the chaplain was in the church saying the service, she went into his room to clean up and she looked a little bit in a book that was lying on the table. When she had first started reading she couldn&#x2019;t stop but had to continue, and did so with increasing interest and zeal. She had not read very long before the chaplain came running in and tore the book away from her and boxed her on the ear and said: &#x201C;What would you have done if &#x2018;the Old One&#x2019; had come!&#x201D; at which point he began reading in the book, most likely to keep &#x2018;the Old One&#x2019; away. But later she found out that the chaplain had stopped preaching, said &#x201C;Amen,&#x201D; gotten down off the pulpit and gone home before he was even half finished with his sermon, so he must have been able to feel somehow or other that there was something wrong at home.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>All of a sudden, a woman in Assendrup, V&#xE6;rslev couldn&#x2019;t get cream from her two cows. She went to a cunning woman and got the advice to buy a new unused pot without bargaining over the price (keeping quiet), fill it with milk and, still keeping quiet, put it over the hearth on a hot glowing fire, put an unused straw broom outside the door and then lock it, because the cows were bewitched, and the guilty one had to appear soon under some pretext. But the guilty person was not to be allowed inside under any circumstances and the pot should be tipped over. All of these instructions were followed precisely and the witch was immediately at the door asking for a pail of milk for her father who had become so ill that she was afraid that he&#x2019;d die before nightfall. But begging and pleading didn't help, the pot was tipped over and, with a scream, she took off home. The next day she lay and was practically scalded to death.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>N&#xE5;r fiskerne p&#xE5; V&#xE6;n&#xF8; om morgenen tidlig fik deres fangst p&#xE5; land, s&#xE5; de i reglen en m&#xE5;ge, der fl&#xF6;j hen og snappede en af de bedste &#xE5;l og forsvandt med den bag ved Fiirbj&#xE6;rg. Siden s&#xE5; man en kone, der ans&#xE5;es for en heks, komme ud fra den anden side af bakken. En anden heks kunde skabe sig om til en hare. N&#xE5;r j&#xE6;geren kom efter den, fik han intet den dag, han kunde s&#xE5; jage s&#xE5; meget han vilde. Pr&#xE6;sten var hos hende en gang for at unders&#xF8;ge den sag, og spurgte hende, om det var sandt, at hun kunde springe som en hare. Hun vilde f&#xF8;rst ikke ind p&#xE5; det, men endelig sagde hun, at dersom han ikke kunde se det p&#xE5; hende, n&#xE5;r hun gik til alters, kaldte hun ham en ringe pr&#xE6;st. Hun kunde jo ikke synke br&#xF8;det.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>When the fishermen on Van&#xF8; brought their catch in early in the morning, they usually saw a gull which flew over and snapped up one of the best eels and disappeared with it over behind Fiirbj&#xE6;rg. Later they saw a woman, who was suspected of being a witch, come out from the other side of the hill. Another witch could turn herself into a hare. When the hunter came after it, he&#x2019;d catch nothing that day, he could hunt as much as he wanted. The minister went to visit her once to investigate this case, and asked her if it was true that she could run like a hare. She at first wouldn&#x2019;t talk about it, but finally she said that if he couldn&#x2019;t see it on her when she went to to communion, then he was a bad minister. She couldn&#x2019;t swallow the bread, you see.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Om en fru Ida p&#xE5; Langes&#xF8; fort&#xE6;lles, at hun sp&#xF8;gede s&#xE5; slemt, da hun var d&#xF8;d. Hun kj&#xF8;rte om natten fra Vigerslev kirkeg&#xE5;rd, hvor hun var begravet, og hjem til Langes&#xF8; med fire sorte heste, og gloende tunger h&#xE6;ngte dem ud af halsen. Hun skulde igjennem Rue, men her boede en mand i spr&#xF8;jtehuset, og han holdt ikke af den sp&#xF8;gen og kj&#xF6;rsel forbi sit hus ved nattetid. Han str&#xF8;ede derfor h&#xF8;rfr&#xF8; p&#xE5; vejen uden for sit hus, ti s&#xE5; kunde hun ikke kj&#xF8;re der over. Hun kunde s&#xE5; heller ikke komme over, men s&#xE5; blev der s&#xE5;dan en bryden og tumlen i huset, at der n&#xE6;ppe var til at v&#xE6;re, ti hun m&#xE5;tte s&#xE5; der igjennem. S&#xE5; str&#xF8;ede manden ikke h&#xF8;rfr&#xF8; tiere, ti det var da v&#xE6;rre, n&#xE5;r hun skulde igjennem huset, end som n&#xE5;r hun kj&#xF8;rte forbi. Hun blev alts&#xE5; ved med sin natlige f&#xE6;rd; men til sidst blev det dem for str&#xE6;ngt p&#xE5; Langes&#xF8;, ti hun holdt s&#xE5;dant et styr der p&#xE5; g&#xE5;rden om natten, s&#xE5; hun var n&#xE6;r ved at s&#xE6;tte alt p&#xE5; den anden ende. Men s&#xE5; var der pr&#xE6;sten Balslev i H&#xE5;rslev, han var s&#xE5; klog, at han kunde mane. De fik da ham til at mane fru Ida. Han manede hende i Sortemose ved Langes&#xF8;. Han havde sine b&#xF8;ger med, men da han tog den f&#xF8;rste og vilde begynde at l&#xE6;se, s&#xE5; slog hun den fra ham, lige s&#xE5; den n&#xE6;ste, han tog, men den tredje m&#xE5;tte hun lade ham beholde. Der blev s&#xE5; rammet en p&#xE6;l igjennem hende, og den sidder i mosen endnu. Dersom nogen kommer hen at r&#xF8;re ved den p&#xE6;l og rokker med den, s&#xE5; h&#xF8;res en stemme nede fra, som siger: "Rok h&#xE5;rdt."
     Om fru Ida fort&#xE6;lles, at da talen i et selskab var om arbejdsfolkene, og der var nogen, der ligesom tog lidt til orde for dem og sagde, at de var lige s&#xE5; godt mennesker som dem, s&#xE5; sagde fru Ida: "Om ogs&#xE5; hele gejstligheden tillader, at arbejdsfolkene kommer til Himmerig, s&#xE5; gj&#xF6;r jeg og min s&#xF6;n Jakob det ikke."</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>They say that Lady Ida at Langes&#xF8; haunted so bad after she'd died. She drove at night from Vigerslev cemetery, where she was buried, home to Langes&#xF8; on a carriage pulled by four black horses with glowing tongues hanging out of their mouths. She had to go through Rue, but there was a man who lived there in the pump house who didn't like all this haunting and driving past his house at night. He spread linseed on the road in front of his house so she couldn't drive over it. She couldn't get past it either, and then there was a huge tumult in the house so that they almost couldn't stay there, because she had to go through the house instead. Then the man didn't spread any linseed anymore, since it was worse when she had to go through the house than when she drove past. She continued with her nightly journey; but finally it got to be too bad there at Langes&#xF8;, since she made such a commotion at the farm there at night that she was about to turn everything upside down. But then there was a minister Balslev in H&#xE5;rslev, he was so wise (cunning) that he could conjure. They got him to conjure Lady Ida. He conjured her in Sortemose near Langes&#xF8;. He had his books with him, but when he took the first one and wanted to start reading, she knocked it away from him, and the same thing happened with the next one he took, but she had to let him keep the third one. A post was then rammed down through her, and it is still out in the swamp to this day. If someone happens to knock into the post or rock it, then one hears a voice from below that says, "Rock hard." 
     They say that if there was a party and someone started talking about the workers and said that they were just as good people as them, then Lady Ida would say, "Even if all the ecclesiastics allow the workers to go to Heaven, my son Jakob and I will not allow that."</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Der fortaltes om pastor Trap i T&#xE5;rs, at han var frimurer, hvorfor han ogs&#xE5; vidste, hvad dag og stund han skulde d&#xF8;. En dag bad han kusken om at sp&#xE6;nde for vognen, og han satte sig da op og bad ham om at kj&#xF8;re til hovedg&#xE5;rden Boller. N&#xE5;r han s&#xE5; kom ind i borgg&#xE5;rden, skulde han efter gammel skik kj&#xF8;re i ottetal om de store lindetr&#xE6;er og derp&#xE5; vende hestene og kj&#xF8;re tilbage den vej, han var kommen, uden at &#xE6;ndse p&#xE5; nogen ting. Men hvor forbavsedes man ikke p&#xE5; Boller, ti just som de stod med de allergladeste ansigter for at tage imod pr&#xE6;sten, vender kusken hestene og kj&#xF8;rer tilbage til T&#xE5;rs pr&#xE6;steg&#xE5;rd, alt hvad remmer og t&#xF6;j kan holde; pr&#xE6;sten bad nemlig kusken om at lade hestene l&#xF8;be, da det havde hastv&#xE6;rk. S&#xE5; snart han atter var kommen hjem, gik han ind og lagde sig i sengen og var d&#xF8;d. Han vilde blot p&#xE5; den m&#xE5;de tage afsked med sine venner i Boller, eftersom det var den sidste dag, han havde at leve i. Fort&#xE6;llersken har selv som barn kjendt den omtalte pr&#xE6;st.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>It was told about pastor Trap in T&#xE5;rs that he was a Freemason, and that is why he knew when he was going to die. One day, he asked his driver to hitch up the wagon, and he climbed up and asked him to drive over to Boller manor farm. When he got into the farm he was supposed to drive a figure eight around the large linden trees according to old custom, and thus turn the horses around and then drive back the way that he had come, without paying attention to anything. But imagine their surprise at Boller when, just as they stood there with happy faces ready to greet the minister, the driver turned the horses around and drove off as fast as the horses could go; the minister had asked the driver to let the horses run since they were in a hurry. As soon as they had gotten home, the minister went in and lay down on his bed and was dead. He just wanted to say goodbye to his friends in Boller that way, since it was his last day alive. The person who told this story had, as a child, known the minister.</english_publication>

I sat and watched it as I drove home along the highway, I saw the plow animals well enough, and they went as clearly as when our animals go and plow, but people, I didn&#x2019;t see any. The couplings clinked, just like when oxen go with a chain up to the coupling of a plow. When it got to the woods, it turned and came back again.

    <danish_publication>P&#xE5; herreg&#xE5;rden Skovsbo boede en herremand, der stod i ledtog med Fanden. En s&#xF8;ndag morgen, mens fruen var i kirke, b&#xF8;d han sin tjener g&#xE5; ud og se, om der ikke n&#xE6;rmede sig en lille sort sky p&#xE5; himlen. Tjeneren gik, men kom tilbage og m&#xE6;ldte, at der slet ingen skyer var at se. Kort efter b&#xF8;d herremanden ham g&#xE5; igjen, og denne gang m&#xE6;ldte tjeneren, at der steg en underlig sort sky op over herreg&#xE5;rden. "Vel!" sagde herremanden, "g&#xE5; s&#xE5; op p&#xE5; dit kammer og bliv d&#xE9;r, til fruen kommer fra kirke." Tjeneren gik, men et &#xF6;jeblik efter h&#xF8;rte han tummel og jamren fra herrens kammer. Nysgjerrig listede han sig ud p&#xE5; gangen til herrens d&#xF6;r.

    <english_publication>A manor lord lived at the manor Skovsbo, and he was in league with the devil. One Sunday morning, while the lady was at church, he asked his servant to go out and look and see if a small black cloud wasn't approaching on the horizon. The servant went out, but came back and said there weren't any clouds to see. A little later, the manor lord asked him to go out again, and this time the servant reported that there was a strange black cloud rising over the manor. "Well," said the manor lord, "go up to your room and stay there until the lady returns from church." The servant went, but a moment later he heard a commotion from the manor lord's chamber. Curious, he tiptoed out to the hall and the master's door. It was locked, and when he wanted to bend down and look through the keyhole, he got his eye poked out. Horrified, he ran down the stairs to yell for help, but he became even more horrified when he saw his master's right hand lying on the stairs. The people who came streaming to the house broke open the door to the fateful room. It was empty, but on the floor were large puddles of the manor lord's blood, and the walls and the ceiling were covered with bright blood red splashes. The manor lord was gone, but the devil couldn't take his right hand, since that had been given away at the altar.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Nede ved B&#xE6;kgr&#xE9;n mellem Borup og Blans kom der en aften en hel flok kartepiger og vilde over &#xE5;en. Denne var svulmet op, s&#xE5; broen var overskyllet, og nu vidste de slet ikke, hvorledes de skulde komme over. Da udbr&#xF8;d &#xE9;n af pigerne: "Havde vi bare et helmis, s&#xE5; kunde vi ride over." I det samme kom der en gr&#xE5; hest og stod ved siden af dem. En af pigerne satte sig straks op p&#xE5; den, og det viste sig, at der var god plads til &#xE9;n mere. S&#xE5; satte &#xE9;n til sig op, men pladsen var lige god derfor. Nu satte flere piger sig op, og alt imens voksede b&#xE6;stet, og blev l&#xE6;ngere og l&#xE6;ngere, s&#xE5; efterh&#xE5;nden fik alle kartepigerne plads p&#xE5; ryggen af det. Da alle var komne op, gik hesten ud i &#xE5;en med dem. Hid indtil havde pigerne ikke sagt et ord af bare forundring, men midt i &#xE5;en udbrod &#xE9;n:      
"J&#xF6;ssus Kristus kors,
sikken et langt hors."
Ved disse ord forsvandt b&#xE6;stet under dem, og alle pigerne l&#xE5; og plaskede midt i vandet. De fleste mener, at det var "e trold", som de red p&#xE5;, og som m&#xE5;tte vige, da korset blev n&#xE6;vnt.</danish_publication>

Then one of the girls exclaimed, &#x201C;If only we had a horse, then we could ride over.&#x201D; Immediately a gray horse appeared and stood next to them. One of the girls immediately got up on it and it turned out that there was plenty of room for more. So another one sat up on the horse, but there was just as much room as before. Now more girls got up, and all the while the animal grew, and got longer and longer so, after a while, all the carding girls had found a place on its back. When they were all up, the horse went out into the river with them. Until now, the girls hadn&#x2019;t said a word out of shear amazement, but right in the middle of the river one of them exclaimed: 
&#x201C;Jesus Christ&#x2019;s cross, 
what a long horse!&#x201D; 
At these words the beast disappeared out from under them, and all the girls lay in the middle of the water. Most people believe that it was &#x201C;a troll&#x201D; which they had ridden on and it had to yield when the cross was named.</english_publication>

S&#xF8;steren blev ved at v&#xE6;re ugift og var i fattige omst&#xE6;ndigheder, men n&#xE5;r hun var i forlegenhed for penge, og de sad og spillede kort i &#xD6;ster-L&#xF8;gum kro, gik hun hen til dem og sagde: "&#xC6; mangler nogle penge." &#x2014; "Ja, hvad gj&#xE6;r det os an, vor s&#xF8;ster," svarede de. "Jo," siger hun, "tigge om dem vil &#xE6; it, og vil I it med det gode, s&#xE5; v&#xE9;d &#xE6; et andet rai. I v&#xE9;d vel nok, hvad I har v&#xE6;ret med til." S&#xE5; greb de hver i lommen og gav hende nogle penge. "Du har altidens en s&#xE6;r maner at komme og ville have penge p&#xE5;," sagde de. "Ja, &#xE6; er n&#xF8;dt til at bruge de midler, der st&#xE5;r i min magt, for med det gode vil I jo ikke." &#x2014; "G&#xE5; kun nu." &#x2014; "Ja, det vil sige, &#xE6; g&#xE5;r til en anden gang." Da den ene af br&#xF6;drene var d&#xF8;d og skulde begraves, sagde pr&#xE6;sten: "Vorherre bevare mig fra at sige, hvad denne mand i sit sidste &#xF6;jeblik har &#xE5;benbaret, da der st&#xE5;r s&#xE5; meget af hans familie her ved graven, men vi vil h&#xE5;be, han bliver salig." 1867 blev der fundet noget nede i mosen i en kobberkjeddel neden for F&#xE5;rehus, knoger og gr&#xF6;nt t&#xF6;j, og al sandsynlighed talte for, at det var her, de to J&#xF8;der var kastet ned. Fysikus fra &#xC5;benr&#xE5; erkl&#xE6;rede, at det var menneskeben, og hovedskallerne havde ogs&#xE5; lighed med J&#xF8;dernes.
     M&#xE6;rkeligt nok var det, at det havde varslet s&#xE5; st&#xE6;rkt der i forvejen. Det havde skreget og jamret, og i min drengetid turde der ingen g&#xE5; forbi den mose. Men da de ting blev gravet op, s&#xE5; h&#xF8;rte varslerne op.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>It was in 1812 when the Cossacks were here, that two Jews came to F&#xE5;rhus Inn late one night. They had come by wagon and had all their wares with them. The inn was owned by two brothers and a sister, and they soon paid off their large debt, just as two good horses were sold by the innkeepers at Flensborg market three days after the Jews had arrived. Three years later, they sold the inn and settled in &#xD8;ster-L&#xF8;gum, where each of the brothers bought a farm. The sister stayed married and was still poor, but when she needed money, and they sat playing cards in &#xD8;ster-L&#xF8;gum Inn, she would go to them and say, "I need some money." -- "Well, it doesn't matter to us that you're our sister," they answered. "Well," she says, "I don't want to beg for it, and if you won't do it, then I know something else I can do. You know darn well what you were party to." Then they each reached into their pockets and gave her some money. "You always have such a strange way about coming for money," they said. "Well, I need to use the methods that I can, since you won't do it by yourselves." -- "Just go." -- "Sure, I'll go for now." When one of the brothers had died and was to be buried, the minister said, "Lord save me from saying what this man confessed in his last moment, as many of his family is here by the graveside, but we hope that he will be blessed." In 1867 something was found in a copper kettle down in the swamp near F&#xE5;rehus, bones and green clothes, and everything pointed toward it being here that the two Jews had been dumped. The physician from &#xC5;benr&#xE5; declared that they were human bones and the skulls looked like the Jews' heads too.
     Strange enough, there had been strong omens there ahead of time. There had been screaming and moaning and in my youth no one dared go past that swamp. But when the things were dug up, the omens stopped.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I den sorte d&#xF8;d var alle folkene i &#xD6;ster-L&#xF8;gum sogn udd&#xF8;de s&#xE5; n&#xE6;r som tre karle, der havde muret sig inde i en hv&#xE6;lvet port i den g&#xE5;rd, som nu ejes af Nis Madsen i Havslund. De havde taget levnetsmidler med for 6 m&#xE5;neder. Men hver ottende dag gik de udenfor huset og hejsede et stykke frisk kj&#xF6;d op p&#xE5; en lang stang. Det h&#xE6;ngte der, til de kom n&#xE6;ste gang, og blev s&#xE5; nedtaget. I lange tider var det helt ford&#xE6;rvet og sort, n&#xE5;r det kom ned, og det var tegn p&#xE5;, at pesten endnu var i luften. S&#xE5;dan blev det ved, indtil kj&#xF8;det var frisk, n&#xE5;r de atter tog det ned, for da var der ikke l&#xE6;ngere nogen fare. S&#xE5; sagde de til hverandre: "Nu vil vi hen at se til vor nabo." Der var den gang 12 g&#xE5;rde ligesom nu. Men de gik fra hus til hus og fandt blot d&#xF8;de folk og kreaturer. S&#xE5;dan vandrede de fra by til by i hele sognet. Folk l&#xE5; d&#xF8;de p&#xE5; marken ved plove og led, og intet andet levende var der end &#xF6;rne og rovdyr. Der stod huse og g&#xE5;rde tomme i 25 til 30 &#xE5;r efter den tid. Der blev hentet en pr&#xE6;st fra &#xC5;benr&#xE5; ud til kirken, og han foranstaltede en takkeb&#xF6;n for pestens oph&#xF8;r.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>During the black death, all the people in &#xD8;ster-L&#xF8;gum parish died except for three young men who had walled themselves into a vaulted door in the farm which is now owned by Nis Madsen in Havslund. They had brought food and water along for six months. But every eight days they went outside the house and raised a piece of fresh meat up on a long pole. It hung there until they came again and then it was taken down. For a long time, it was completely rotten and black when it came down, and that was a sign that the plague was still in the air. It continued like that until the meat was fresh when they took it down again because then there was no longer any danger. Then they said to one another: "Now we&#x2019;ll go and see to our neighbors." At that time there were twelve farms just like now. But they went from house to house and found only dead people and animals. They wandered from village to village like this in the whole parish. People lay dead in the fields by plows and gates, and there was nothing else alive except for eagles and beasts of prey. Houses stood empty for twenty-five to thirty years after that. A minister was brought out from &#xC5;benr&#xE5; to the church, and he said a prayer of thanksgiving for the end of the plague.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>It was so overgrown with woods in N&#xF8;rre-Hjarup that when there was going to be a wedding, two young men had to go ahead and cut down branches so that they wouldn&#x2019;t take the bride&#x2019;s crown off, and when they came to a clearing, which is still today called Skovende (end of the woods), they had to stop and wait for the bride to come. &#xD8;ster-L&#xF8;gum town wasn&#x2019;t as pretty then as it is now. One time, at a wedding in Hjarup, one of the young men who was supposed to go ahead like that had been previously engaged to the bride and, when the newlywed couple were driving back from the church, the two young men jumped up on the back of the wedding carriage and drove with them home to the wedding farm. When the guests were done eating, the dancing as usual began upstairs. Then the bridegroom came forward and said, &#x201C;Each and everyone from the whole town is welcome in my house and gets free food and drink except for Tagef&#xE6;l, he can&#x2019;t come along.&#x201D; The bridegroom had just said these words when the young man who had been the previous lover of the bride comes running in with an axe in his hand and cleaves the bridegroom&#x2019;s forehead, and at the same time grabs the bride and runs with her down to Hjarup river to the pool, which is still called Semph&#xF8;l after the murderer, he was an immigrant German and was called Semptafel. The pool is twenty-four feet deep and they both drowned there.</english_publication>

Then the man says to the woman, that he needed to get off for a bit, and she would have to hold the horses. But before he got down, he took a home knit, yellow woolen scarf from his throat and tossed it to her, and said that if anything came, she should hit at it as hard as she could with it. Then he jumps off the wagon to the left and goes into the woods; shortly afterwards, a werewolf comes back and puts its forelegs up on the near front wheel and makes like it wants to get into the wagon. She hits at it as well hard as she can with the scarf for several minutes. All of a sudden, the animal turns around and disappears into the bushes. A little later, the man comes back, gets into the wagon and drives home. When they come into the living room, and the woman got a lamp lit, she saw that there was a yellow woolen thread in the man's teeth. Then she says, "But Per, you are a werewolf." -- "Well, not any more, because now I am saved Maren!"</english_publication>

Men nissen vil ogs&#xE5; have sin l&#xF6;n derfor, han vil have et fad s&#xF8;dgr&#xF8;d med sm&#xF6;r i, og tr&#xE6;ffer det sig, at der er lovlig lidt, s&#xE5; h&#xE6;vner han sig meget.

Han gik s&#xE5; ned i stalden og tog fat p&#xE5; den st&#xF6;rste og bedste ko, der fandtes, tog den ved hornene og vred halsen om p&#xE5; den.

Da han nu havde f&#xE5;et den ind i stalden og bundet, klagede han sig slemt i sin ryg: "&#xC5;&#xE5; h&#xE5;&#xE5;, mi ryg, Skr&#xE5;lles hie wa l&#xE5;ng, &#xE5; den r&#xF8;&#xF8; kow wa t&#xE5;ng, &#xE5;&#xE5; h&#xE5;&#xE5;, mi ryg."

    <english_publication>Between B&#xF8;rglum town over to Vollerup town there is a big heath called Skrolles heath. Places are built around it, and in one of the places there is a nisse who watches the man&#x2019;s cows in the winter, so that those cows are much better off than those of the other farmers. But the nisse also wants his pay for that, he wants a bowl of sweet porridge with butter in it, and if it happens that there is too little, then he takes a little revenge. One night when he came as usual to get his porridge, he didn&#x2019;t find any butter in it and naturally got quite upset, and immediately decided to avenge himself. He went down into the barn and got hold of the biggest and best cow there was, took it by the horns and wrung its neck. After he&#x2019;d sat and gloated over this a while, he decided he&#x2019;d better eat all of the porridge after all. Then he found the butter at the bottom of the bowl, because it had been hidden by one of the girls to trick him a little bit. Then he really regretted what he&#x2019;d done and decided to make it right again. He took the dead cow on his shoulders and walked with it across the heath to another big farm where he knew that there was a cow of the same size and just as good, and he took the live cow on his shoulders and carried it back. Then, after he&#x2019;d gotten it into the barn and had tied it up, he complained bitterly about his back: &#x201C;Owww my back, Skrolles heath was long, and the red cow was so heavy, oww my back.&#x201D; He said it so loud that the people down in the farm could hear it.</english_publication>

And so he wanted to go out and find other people, but he didn&#x2019;t think that it would be worth it to go north, since he knew that the plague had come from the north. So he thought that he&#x2019;d better search to the east or to the south. So he set out, but it took many days and he didn&#x2019;t meet any people. Finally one day he noticed that there was smoke coming from a little house. So he went there and it was there that this widow and her daughter lived. They had stayed inside since they didn&#x2019;t dare go outside as long as the plague lasted. He comes to them and settles down with them and the two young ones get married.

Endskj&#xF6;ndt m&#xF8;lleren betalte sine afgifter bestemt hver termin, s&#xE5; herremanden dog med onde &#xF6;jne til ham n&#xE6;rmest p&#xE5; grund af hans rigdom.

M&#xF8;lleren klagede til herremanden, som jo var hans husbond, endskj&#xF6;ndt han havde mistanke til, at herren selv stod bag ved, og som han formodede, gjorde herren ingen ting ved sagen. Men en del &#xE5;r efter blev en r&#xF6;verbande fanget i Fjeld skov, og de blev halshuggede ved Skindvad oppe i N&#xF6;rre herred. Inden de kom af med livet, bekjendte de, at de havde &#xF8;vet indbrud i Ramten m&#xF8;lle efter samr&#xE5;d med herremanden, og han havde betalt dem noget for at &#xF8;ve den gjerning.

    <english_publication>Ramten mill is in Nimtoft where a lot of rich people used to live. Many years ago there was a miller who also had ships at sea. The mill belonged at that time to Mejlg&#xE5;rd, and the manor lord there was accused of both robbing people on the highways himself and being connected to a robber band that lodged in N&#xF8;rre province. Even though the miller paid his debts promptly each due date, the manor lord always looked at him with an evil eye, probably because of the miller&#x2019;s wealth. Then it happened one night that the robbers attacked the mill, beat up the man and his wife and, after they had plundered everything that there was, they set fire to the farm. The miller complained to the manor lord, who was his master, even though he suspected that the manor lord was behind it and, as he anticipated, the manor lord did nothing about the case. But several years later, a robber band was caught in Fjeld forest, and they were decapitated near Skindvad up in N&#xF8;rre province. Before they were executed, they admitted that they had committed the break-in at Ramten mill after consultation with the manor lord, and he had paid them something to commit the crime. 
     The mill doesn&#x2019;t exist any more, but the mill pond is there. For many years, it was just a little farm, but now it has been made into a stamping mill.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Imellem Varde og &#xD6;llevad ligger nogle h&#xF6;je og hulveje, hvor der i gammel tid har v&#xE6;ret r&#xF8;vere, og stedet kaldes endnu R&#xF6;verkj&#xE6;lder. Herremanden fra Endrupholm kom en aften ridende der forbi. De havde snor over vejen og klokker, der ringede nede i hulen, s&#xE5; de kunde h&#xF8;re, han kom, og de sprang ud og vilde gribe ham, men fik kun fat i hestens hale. Da tr&#xE6;kker manden sin sabel og hugger bag ud efter den, der holdt fast, rammer den ogs&#xE5; og hugger h&#xE5;nden af. Derefter rider han, hvad hesten kan springe, for at ville ind til Varde. Men da han kommer i n&#xE6;rheden, er vasen helt overflydt med vand. Han vender s&#xE5; hesten, rider til Gjellerup og sp&#xF6;rger i en g&#xE5;rd, om han kan f&#xE5; hesten ind og selv blive der. En lille dreng og hans moder kommer ud og siger, at det kan han godt. Men i det samme siger drengen: "Moder, moder! der h&#xE6;nger min faders h&#xE5;nd i hestens hale." Han kunde kjende den p&#xE5; en ring. &#xD6;jeblikkelig springer herremanden p&#xE5; hesten og rider igjen til Varde. Han beder til Gud og lover, at hvis han kan komme godt over vandet, s&#xE5; vil han bygge et kor til Varde kirke. Koret skal virkelig v&#xE6;re bygget af ham.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Between Varde and &#xD8;llevad there are some mounds and some sunken roads where in the olden days there used to be robbers and the place is still called R&#xF8;verkj&#xE6;lder (Robber Cellar). The manor lord from Endrupholm came riding by there one night. They had a rope over the road, and bells which rang down in the den so they could hear that he was coming and they jumped out and wanted to grab him but only got hold of the horse&#x2019;s tail. Then the man takes out his saber and slashes back out at the one who was holding onto the tail and chops his hand off. Afterward, he rides as fast as the horse can run since he wants to get to Varde. But when he gets close, the road is completely flooded with water. He turns the horse around and rides to Gjellerup and asks at a farm if he can bring his horse in and stay there. A little boy and his mother come out and say that he can do that. But at the same time the boy says: &#x201C;Mother, mother! My father&#x2019;s hand is hanging there in the horse&#x2019;s tail.&#x201D; He recognized it by a ring. In the blink of an eye, the manor lord jumps back up on the horse and rides again to Varde. He prays to God and promises that if he makes it safely over the water that he&#x2019;ll build a choir box for Varde church. The choir box is really supposed to have been built by him.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Once a mill near D&#xF8;rup burned and a girl got burned in there and they said that she walked again. Every night there was a huge commotion in the outlying farm buildings and noises in the farm, and then a big black dog ran through the barn. A joiner who was sleeping in one of the rooms saw the dog come along a thin plank and wondered quite a bit about that. People had also seen the miller come out with a lantern in his hand. In the end, he wound up selling the farm because of the dog. They said that the miller had burned the mill himself and it was his fault that the girl was burned in.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Henne p&#xE5; Lundbj&#xE6;rg mark er tre h&#xF6;je. En aften for mange &#xE5;r siden kom der to herrer fra Kj&#xF6;benhavn til et skovfogedsted om aftenen og sagde til de gamle skovfogedfolk: "Kan I vise os den h&#xF6;j, der ligger &#xF6;sten for V&#xE6;rum &#xD8;led, for den skal v&#xE6;re rigere end kongens skatkammer". Det havde de nemlig l&#xE6;st i nogle gamle b&#xF8;ger ovre i Kj&#xF6;benhavn. S&#xE5; t&#xE6;nkte de gamle folk: "Hilled&#xF8;d, det m&#xE5; vi drage os nytte af". De bev&#xE6;rtede de rejsende herrer godt og viste dem n&#xE6;ste dag en af de andre to h&#xF6;je, og alts&#xE5; ikke den rigtige. De fremmede gravede s&#xE5; i h&#xF6;jen i flere dage, men fandt ingen ting og rejste da til Kj&#xF6;benhavn igjen. Da de var s&#xE5; vel afrejste, s&#xE5; gravede de gamle skovfogedfolk i den rigtige h&#xF6;j, som rigdommen var i, og s&#xE5; fandt de en masse guld og s&#xF8;lv samt et stort rustent riddersv&#xE6;rd. De bar hele herligheden hjem i deres lille hus og var meget henrykt over deres velstand. Men da natten kom, blev der en rumsteren og en anstalt, s&#xE5; de kunde ikke v&#xE6;re i hytten, og de m&#xE5;tte v&#xE5;ge den ganske nat. Den p&#xE5;f&#xF8;lgende dag var der ingen ting i vejen, men s&#xE5; snart det blev m&#xF8;rkt, begyndte den samme rumsteren. Det varede i den m&#xE5;de i tre n&#xE6;tter, s&#xE5; rejste manden hen og r&#xE5;df&#xF8;rte sig med en klog mand. Han sagde, at de skulde tage sv&#xE6;rdet og b&#xE6;re det derop igjen og grave det ned, det skulde nok hj&#xE6;lpe. S&#xE5; gjorde de det, og det hjalp, da de f&#xF8;rst blev af med sv&#xE6;rdet, og nu var de blevne til rige folk.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Out on Lundbj&#xE6;rg field there are three mounds. One night many years ago two men from Copenhagen came to the house of a forest ranger and said to the old forest ranger and his people: &#x201C;Can you show us that mound which lies east of V&#xE6;rum &#xD8;led, since it is supposed to have more riches in it than the king&#x2019;s treasure room." They had read about this in some old books over in Copenhagen. Then the old people thought: &#x201C;My lord, we could get something out of this." They served the traveling gentlemen well, and showed them one of the other two mounds the next day, and not the right one. The strangers dug in the mound for many days, but didn&#x2019;t find a thing and went back to Copenhagen again. When they were good and gone, the old forest ranger dug in the right mound where the treasure was, and they found a bunch of gold and silver as well as a large, rusty knight&#x2019;s sword. They carried all of it home to their little house, and were delighted with their wealth. But when night came, there was such a rummaging about and commotion, that they couldn&#x2019;t stay in the cottage, and they had to stay up the whole night. The next day, there was nothing wrong, but as soon as it got dark, the same rummaging about began. It lasted like that for three nights, then the man went off and asked the advice of a cunning man. He told them that they should take the sword and carry it back up there and bury it, that would probably help. So they did that and it helped as soon as they got rid of the sword, and now they had become rich.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I begyndelsen af dette &#xE5;rhundrede, da jorderne blev udskiftede, kom der til Stistrup i Fovlum en avtoriseret landm&#xE5;ler, som kaldtes Holm (Skov, Foss?), og han begik bedrageri ved udskiftningen. En mand og hans to s&#xF6;nner var blevne uenige med deres nabo om retningen af skjellet. Det var i Stistrup udmark. Manden og s&#xF6;nnerne var med der ude og gjorde sig s&#xE5; br&#xF8;sige, at det til sidst blev, som han vilde have det. Men da s&#xE5; landm&#xE5;leren kom ned i Fovlum Korre, gjorde han ogs&#xE5; der bedrageri, og ved nordre enden af korren kan enhver se den dag i dag, at det ikke er, som det skal v&#xE6;re. Der var et gammelt digeh&#xE6;v rundt om korren, og jeg er f&#xF8;dt lige ved det dige, s&#xE5; jeg kjender god besked om sagen. I udmarken er det ogs&#xE5; let at se, at der er fejl. Den landm&#xE5;ler g&#xE5;r igjen p&#xE5; Stistrup-vejen ad Fovlum til, og hvem der kommer ad det str&#xF8;g ved den tid, han g&#xE5;r der, bliver vildfarende. Man h&#xF8;rer en ynkelig stemme, der siger: "Ryk i kj&#xE6;den og hold i stangen. Stistrup udmark og Fovlum K&#xE5;rrr!"</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>At the beginning of this century, when the fields were partitioned, an authorized surveyor came to Stistrup in Fovlum. His name was Holm (Skov, Foss?) and he engaged in a swindle with the partitioning. A man and his two sons had gotten into a disagreement with a neighbor about the proper boundary. That was on Stistrup outer field. The man and his sons were out there and were so gruff that they finally got it the way they wanted it. But when the surveyor got down to the town pond in Fovlum, he also did a little swindle there too, and at the northern end of the pond, everyone can see, even to this day, that it isn't the way it should be. There was an old embankment around the pond, and I was born right near it, so I know quite a bit about the affair. It is easy to see in the outer field that there's also been a mistake. That land surveyor walks again on Stistrup road toward Fovlum, and anyone who goes on that stretch of road while he is out walking loses their way. One hears a pathetic voice that says, "Pull the chain and hold the post. Stistrup outer field and Fovlum town pond!"</english_publication>

Puslingen sagde intet, da han kom, og svarede heller ikke, da han blev spurgt, og det undrede folkene sig meget over. Nogle af dem antog ham for en lille hjeml&#xF8;s dreng, andre for en nisse, men de lod ham sidde, da det var synd at jage ham ud, hvis han var en fattig dreng, og ikke r&#xE5;deligt at forn&#xE6;rme ham, hvis han var en nisse. Da nu konen kom b&#xE6;rende med grisen ind p&#xE5; bordet, udbr&#xF8;d han: "Vidt har jeg rejst, og meget har jeg set; jeg har set Rold skov opbr&#xE6;nde, opbr&#xE6;nde, opbr&#xE6;nde tre gange, men jeg har aldrig f&#xF6;r set en p&#xF8;lse med fire ben og en tryne."</danish_publication>

Some thought that he was a little homeless boy, others a nisse, but they let him sit since it was a shame to chase him out if he were a poor boy and not too smart to offend him if he were a nisse. Now when the wife came in carrying the pig to the table, he burst out: &#x201C;Widely I&#x2019;ve traveled and much have I seen; I've seen Rold forest burn up, burn up, burn up three times, but I&#x2019;ve never before seen a sausage with four legs and a snout.&#x201D;</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>P&#xE5; Bramstrup, en mil fra Odense, var der for mange &#xE5;r siden en forvalter, som hed Maes eller Markus Kalv, der bestyrede g&#xE5;rden for en gammel enkefrue, som den gang var ejerinde af den. Denne forvalter var en grusom tyran mod f&#xE6;steb&#xF8;nderne, han gik altid ud p&#xE5; at gnie og plage dem og fratage dem deres ejendom. Der er en skov, som den gang tilh&#xF8;rte de Volderslev b&#xF8;nder og kaldtes Lunden, hvilken gr&#xE6;nsede til Langholm, en skov, som h&#xF8;rte til Bramstrup. Denne lund kunde Markus Kalv ikke t&#xE5;le, at b&#xF8;nderne skulde beholde, men s&#xF6;gte ved uretf&#xE6;rdighed at frar&#xF8;ve dem den. Tog jord fra g&#xE5;rdens mark i st&#xF8;vlerne o. s. v. og svor ved den hellige treenighed, at den jord, hvorp&#xE5; han stod samt de grene, der hang over hans hoved, tilh&#xF8;rte fruen p&#xE5; Bramstrup. Da han havde gjort dette, gik han hjem til fruen p&#xE5; Bramstrup og sagde: "Nu er Lund og Langholm dit." Men den gamle frue blev forskr&#xE6;kket og svarede: "Er Lund og Langholm mit, s&#xE5; er helvedes pine dit." Han d&#xF8;de nogle &#xE5;r efter, men fik ingen ro i graven, han g&#xE5;r endnu den dag i dag i Langholm og lader sig h&#xF8;re om natten p&#xE5; adskillige tider af &#xE5;ret med en forf&#xE6;rdelig stemme, som hverken ligner menneskers eller dyrs. At Markus Kalv endnu findes i Langholm, kan bekr&#xE6;ftes af flere gamle folk fra omegnen.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Many years ago, there was a foreman at Bramstrup, a mile from Odense, who was called Maes or Markus Kalv, and he ran the farm for an old widow who at that time was the owner of it. That foreman was a horrible tyrant toward the lease holders, he always went out to harass and punish them and confiscate their possessions. There was a forest that, at the time, belonged to the peasants in Volderslev, and it was called Lunden, and it bordered on Langholm, a forest that belonged to Bramstrup. Markus Kalv couldn't bear that the peasants had this forest, and he tried to steal it from them unjustly. He took dirt from the farm's field and put it in his boots, etc. and then swore to the holy trinity that the earth on which he stood as well as the branches that hung over his head belonged to the lady at Bramstrup. When he'd done this, he went home to the lady at Bramstrup and said, "Lund and Langholm are now yours." But the old lady became frightened and answered, "If Lund and Langholm are mine, then the pains of hell are yours." He died some years later, but had no peace in the grave, he still walks to this very day in Langholm and lets himself be heard at night at different times of year with a terrible voice that resembles neither that of a human nor an animal. Many older people from the area will confirm that Markus Kalv is still to be found in Langholm .</english_publication>

I can't remember how many thousand rooster steps it is from the farm but every year, just before Christmas, there's a horrible noise and then it takes a step toward the farm. 
     There were three like that who followed along with each other one evening before Christmas, and then there's a horrible wail. They ask each other what it could possibly be, they couldn't understand it, and they ran as fast as they could. Then they come to a place and they go in and tell them about it, they couldn't figure out what it could possibly be. "You were lucky you didn't get in its way; it's a horrible thing, and many people have had real problems with it." Then one of the farmhands asks what it is. That was the nightraven, he says. 
     Another one was knocked out cold so many times because he'd encountered it; he was the cowhand at the farm, and he'd told this old man about it.</english_publication>

Her boede en gang en bj&#xE6;rgmand, og han hentede en kone i nabolaget ind i Gammelh&#xF6;j for at sv&#xF8;be b&#xF6;rn. Da konen var f&#xE6;rdig dermed og skulde hjem, gav bj&#xE6;rgmanden hende et forkl&#xE6;defuldt kul. Konen mente ikke, det var umagen v&#xE6;rd at b&#xE6;re dem hjem, og kastede dem derfor fra sig udenfor. Men da hun kom hjem, s&#xE5; hun til sin forundring og &#xE6;rgrelse, at det var guld, bj&#xE6;rgmanden havde givet hende for ulejligheden, ti der hang endnu en del guldst&#xF8;v i forkl&#xE6;det.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Just to the east of H&#xF8;je town in Lunde parish there's a large gravel mound they call Gammelh&#xF8;j (Old Mound). A mound man lived there once and he brought a woman in the neighborhood into the mound to swaddle children. When the woman was finished and was to go home, the mound man gave her an apron full of coal. The woman didn't think it was worth the trouble to carry it home, and so she threw it away outside. But when she got home, much to her surprise and disappointment, she saw that it was gold that the mound man had given her for her inconvenience, since there was still a little gold dust clinging to her apron.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Lamdrup Kohave, Svindinge, som for hundrede &#xE5;r siden var et stort overdrev til f&#xE6;llesgr&#xE6;sning for Lamdrup bym&#xE6;nd, er nu dels skov, dels agerland; men i den tid pigerne gik herud for at malke, var der en gang en pige, som flere gange traf en fremmed mand derude, som hun snakkede med. Det faldt hende dog omsider underligt, og s&#xE5; fortalte hun om ham hjemme. Der var da nogen, som sagde til hende, at n&#xE5;r han nu kom n&#xE6;ste gang igjen, s&#xE5; skulde hun sige til ham, at han skulde vende sig om. Dette gjorde hun ogs&#xE5; n&#xE6;ste dag, og da hun derved fik ham at se p&#xE5; ryggen, opdagede hun, at han bagtil lignede en elletrumpe. Det var alts&#xE5; en ellemand, hun var kommen i lag med.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Lamdrup cow pasture, Svindinge, was a big surplus area for common grazing for the Lamdrup townsmen one hundred years ago. Now it is partly wooded and partly cultivated. Back when the maids used to go out there to milk, there was a girl who once met a foreign man out there several times with whom she talked. It seemed odd to her and so she told the people at home about him. There was somebody who told her that the next time he came she should tell him to turn around. She did that, too, the next day and when she got to see his back, she discovered that his back looked like an alder stump. It was an elf whom she had come into contact with.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>For mange &#xE5;r siden skulde kirkeklokkerne i Kv&#xE6;rndrup gj&#xF8;res i stand, da de ikke var rigtig vellydende. En hr. Essi blev antaget hertil og fik udleveret en del s&#xF8;lv og messing til at lappe med. Han stak imidlertid disse gode sager i sin egen lomme og lempede dem med kobber og bly. Da man s&#xE5; skulde til at ringe med klokkerne, var de alt for d&#xF8;de i klangen, og man trak derfor st&#xE6;rkere og st&#xE6;rkere i rebet, og til sidst blev det s&#xE5; voldsomt, at den ene klokke slog sig l&#xF8;s og foer ud af lydhullerne, helt hen over byen, og faldt f&#xF8;rst ned i "Dybe Mae", en eng vesten for Kv&#xE6;rndrup h&#xF8;rende under Egeskovg&#xE5;rd. Det s&#xE6;re af det var imidlertid, at klokken p&#xE5; vejen hen over byen sang f&#xF8;lgende vers, der r&#xF8;bede Essings bedragerier:
"S&#xF8;lv og messing det gjemte hr. Essi,
kobber og bli det satte han i."
Der blev nu sendt en tre, fire karle ud for at lede om klokken, og de fandt ogs&#xE5; godt nok hullet, hvori den sad, og fik lagt et reb om den. De havde allerede f&#xE5;et den op til overfladen, da en af karlene bandte en stor ed, at nu var de den da vis; men aldrig s&#xE5; snart havde han sagt dette, f&#xF6;r klokken igjen gik til bunds, og siden efter er der ingen, der har h&#xF8;rt eller set noget til den.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Many years ago, the church bells in Kv&#xE6;rndrup were to be repaired, since they weren&#x2019;t really ringing properly. They contracted with a Mr. Essi to do the repairs and he was given some silver and brass to patch the bells with. In the meantime, he pocketed this good stuff and patched them with copper and lead instead. When they went to ring the bells, they were far too dead in their sound, and so they pulled harder and harder in the ropes and finally the pulling was so violent that one of the bells knocked itself loose and flew out of the sound holes, and flew all the way over the town and finally down into &#x201C;Dybe M&#xE6;,&#x201D; a marsh west of Kv&#xE6;ndrup which belongs to Egeskov farm. The weird thing about it was that while the bell was flying over the town, it sang the following verse, which revealed Essing's swindel: 
&#x201C;Silver and brass has Mr. Essi hidden, 
Copper and lead, that&#x2019;s what he put in!&#x201D; 
Now three or four young men were sent out to look for the bell, and they found the hole where it was and got a rope put around it. They had already gotten it up to the surface when one of the young men swore that now they had it; but as soon as he said that, the bell went down to the bottom, and since then nobody has seen or heard from it.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Fra Trunderup by, Kv&#xE6;rndrup sogn, og vesterud mod Svendborg - Odense landevejen g&#xE5;r Rokkergyden (Rakkergyden.) T&#xE6;t ved gyden nord for byen ligger Rokkerkj&#xE6;ret, der nu er en eng, og umiddelbart op til denne ned mod Stervbog&#xE5;rden findes en dam, hvor der i lange tider har ligget et menneskeligt kranium. Det har v&#xE6;ret for dagens lys flere gange, n&#xE5;r dammen har v&#xE6;ret ryddet, men man har altid kastet det ud igjen, n&#xE5;r arbejdet var f&#xE6;rdigt. Gamle folk v&#xE9;d at fort&#xE6;lle om, at der ogs&#xE5; har v&#xE6;ret andre skeletdele i dammen f. eks. brystkassen, og alt dette skal stamme fra en J&#xF8;de &#x2014; bissekr&#xE6;mmer &#x2014; som er bleven dr&#xE6;bt og ber&#xF8;vet sin kramkiste. Nogle siger, at det var bym&#xE6;ndene, som for&#xF8;vede dette r&#xF6;veri og da havde kastet den d&#xF8;de krop i Rokkerkj&#xE6;ret.
      I mellem denne dam og Rokkergyden g&#xE5;r der en hovedl&#xF8;s mand, som da skulde v&#xE6;re gjenf&#xE6;rdet af den dr&#xE6;bte J&#xF8;de, men dette sidste synes at v&#xE6;re et yngre till&#xE6;g.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Rokkergyden (Rakkergyden; Rakker alley) stretches from Trunderup town in Kv&#xE6;rndrup parish west toward the Svendborg-Odense road. Close to the alley north of town is Rokker swamp, which is now a meadow, and right up next to that, down toward Stervbo farm, is a pond where a human skull has lain for a long time. It has come to light several times when the pond has been cleaned, but they've always tossed it back again when the work was done. Old people say that there have been other skeleton parts in the pond, for example a rib cage, and all of that is supposed to have come from a Jew--a wandering peddler--who had been killed and his chest of wares stolen. Some say that it was the townsfolk who robbed him and threw the dead body into Rakker swamp. 
      A headless man walks between the pond and Rakker alley, and that's supposed to be the revenant of the murdered Jew, but that seems to be a later addition.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There was a man and a farmhand who were out on the heath and digging peat besides the swamp. Then the man says to the farmhand: &#x201C;Let's take a real nap today, because peat diggers are allowed that.&#x201D; This man had become enemies with his neighbor. That guy had an old mare nag which stood with her foal nearby. So now after they&#x2019;ve lain down to sleep, the man gets up and walks away, but the farmhand notices that the man has gone. He thought that he&#x2019;d gone off to work, but then he sees that one hell of a big wolf is coming, and it jumps up on the foal. Then the farmhand thought: &#x201C;That would be a real shame, if it&#x2019;s going to go and tear the man&#x2019;s foal apart.&#x201D; With that he grabs his scythe and wants to go and save the foal, but as soon as he gets there, the wolf rips the throat out of the foal, and he chases the wolf away, but the foal was dead. The farmhand was really sad about this and went and looked about and the man was gone and there was nobody to see. He thought about going over to the other man to tell him that the foal was dead. But in the meantime he sees that the man he&#x2019;d been digging peat with comes up from the left side of the hill, where they had lain down. &#x201C;Where&#x2019;ve you been?&#x201D; says the farmhand. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been alone on the other side by myself.&#x201D; &#x201C;No you haven&#x2019;t&#x201D; says the farmhand, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a lie, and you&#x2019;re a werewolf and a devil and I&#x2019;m a witness that you tore the man&#x2019;s foal apart.&#x201D; Just as soon as it's revealed, then they can&#x2019;t become it anymore, says the legend.</english_publication>

Han bad dem, om de ikke vilde l&#xF8;se ham, indtil han fik slugt det, han havde i lommen. Da var det et barnehj&#xE6;rte.

Finally, Daniel was tied up, but then they wouldn't let him go again. He asked them to untie him until he finished swallowing what he had in his pocket. It was a child's heart. He'd already swallowed two and he believed that if he could eat three unborn boy baby's hearts, then no one would be able to defeat him. But they wouldn't untie him. He was executed and, according to what they say, buried in the cemetery where his grave is in the southeast corner. There was a little round mound there they called Daniel's grave.</english_publication>

A little after the minister left, the coachman hears an incredible noise, and since it continues for a long time, he thinks that the minister is probably having difficulties, so he takes the wagon whip in hand and rushes off to help the minister. But when he gets almost up to the minister, he [the minister] yells at him to stay away, because otherwise he can&#x2019;t get power over the ghost. Finally the minister is finished and he comes over to the farmhand; he then says to him: &#x201C;If you ever in the future drive on this road where we&#x2019;re stopped, it will cost you your life.&#x201D; The farmhand remembered the warning for a while but then one night when he was coming home from market in Skive, he thinks that it&#x2019;s quite a way to go just to avoid the forbidden road, he drives in on it but then tips over and breaks his neck.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There was a minister who was to conjure a man, and on the way home, the horses stood still, so he couldn't drive away from the spot. Then he took one of the back wheels...

He couldn't control himself, but looked out, and then the roof of the house picked up right there, and the wagon tipped over.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Den sorte smed i N&#xF6;rre-Tranders kunde stille et par l&#xF8;bske heste. Han gjorde det en gang her oppe ved m&#xF8;llen. Et par m&#xE6;nd var agende med en mand fra Klarup, og s&#xE5; var de ogs&#xE5; inde i m&#xF8;lleg&#xE5;rden. Hestene stod imidlertid foran vognen, og s&#xE5; blev de l&#xF8;bske. Manden, der ejede dem, sad jo inde og blev helt elendig, men s&#xE5; sagde smeden, som ogs&#xE5; sad der inde: "Det har ingen n&#xF8;d, lad mig komme ud." Han kom ud i en fart, og s&#xE5; blev hestene st&#xE5;ende ved den f&#xF8;rste g&#xE5;rd &#xF8;sten for m&#xF8;llen. "Nu kan vi godt g&#xE5; ind og tage os en dram til", sagde smeden, og hestene blev ogs&#xE5; st&#xE5;ende, til de kom ned til dem. En anden gang var det smedens kone, der gjorde det, for hun kunde det samme, han kunde. Det var et par b&#xE6;ster for et l&#xE6;s kj&#xE6;rve. Hun sagde: "T&#xF6;v lidt, det er ikke den vej, I skal", og s&#xE5; stod de nede p&#xE5; Utrupvejen ved Jens Rytters. Den sorte smed var for resten ogs&#xE5; en dygtig dyrl&#xE6;ge.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>The Black Smith in N&#xF8;rre-Tranders could stop a pair of run away horses. He did that once up here by the mill. A couple of guys were driving with a man from Klarup and then they also stopped in at the mill. The horses were standing in front of the wagon at the time, and then they stampeded. The man who owned them was sitting inside and got very upset, but then the smith, who was also sitting inside there said, "It won't help, let me go outside." He went outside quickly, and then the horses stopped at the first farm to the east of the mill. "Now we can go in and have us another dram," said the smith, and the horses kept standing there too until they came for them. Another time, it was the smith's wife who did it, since she could do it too, she could. It was a couple of horses pulling a load of hay. She said, "Wait a bit, you aren't supposed to go that way," and then they stood there down on Utrup road by Jens Rytter's place. The Black Smith was also a good animal doctor too.</english_publication>

Pr&#xE6;sten kom fra marken og s&#xE5; det. "Hvad er det, du sidder og bestiller her, min pige?" siger han, "hvem har bedt dig det?" Det havde hendes moder, men nu vilde koen ikke give mere m&#xE6;lk, for nu kom der blod. Ja, hun skulde blive ved, s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge der kom noget, enten det s&#xE5; var blod eller m&#xE6;lk. S&#xE5; blev hun ved, og s&#xE5; d&#xF8;de koen. Det skal have v&#xE6;ret en g&#xE5;rdmands ko her oppe i byen. Han bliver s&#xE5; elendig over det, te han mistede hans helsen og d&#xF8;de omsider.

    <english_publication>A minister who was very poor once lived here in Glenstrup. His wife had complained for a long time that they had too little milk, they had a hard time getting butter and other such things. But then one day the minister comes out into the farm and his daughter is sitting by an elder bush and is milking milk out of the elder. Naturally, the minister&#x2019;s wife was a witch, and she had sent her out to milk, but the minister knew nothing about this. The minister came from the field and saw this. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s that you&#x2019;re sitting and doing here, my girl?&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;Who asked you to do this?&#x201D; Her mother had, but now the cow couldn&#x2019;t give any more milk, because now there came blood. Yes, she should continue as long as something came, if it was either blood or milk. Then she continued and then the cow died. It was supposedly a farmer&#x2019;s cow here in the town. The minister got so upset about it, that he lost his health and died a little later. The elder stands in the parsonage even now, it stands a little apart in the western corner of the cabbage patch.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A troll lived in a mound on Horns field, and he had a black cow which grazed along with the cows of the farmer who lived near the mound. The hired boy who took care of the cows also had to take care of the troll&#x2019;s cow but he also got paid for that because every day near the mound there would be a plate of pancakes with a two shilling piece on top. Then one year the farmer hired a boy who was really nasty. The first day he went out with the cows, the troll&#x2019;s black cow also came along. The boy now went over to the mound to see if it was true what he&#x2019;d heard that there was supposed to be a plate of pancakes with a two shilling piece on top there. Well, sure enough, it was true and the boy ate the pancakes and put the two shilling piece in his pocket. But then he unbuttoned his pants and did what he had to on the plate. From that day on, neither pancakes nor the two shilling piece appeared, but the black cow continued to appear, so the boy had to take care of the troll&#x2019;s cow without any pay.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Kristen S&#xF8; i Voldby pr&#xF8;vede engang styrke med Englands st&#xE6;rkeste mand. Greven p&#xE5; Frisenborg var i Kj&#xF6;benhavn og var da ogs&#xE5; oppe hos kongen. Her traf han en engelsk general, med hvem han kom i samtale. Generalen fortalte da blandt andet, at i England havde man s&#xE5; st&#xE6;rk en mand, at ingen kunde overvinde ham, de kaldte ham derfor "Kj&#xE6;mpebryderen". Da siger greven, at i hans grevskab var en mand, ham troede han ikke, Kj&#xE6;mpebryderen kunde sl&#xE5;, men det, mente generalen, var en let sag. Enden blev da, at greven sendte bud til Frisenborg, og generalen til England, de to st&#xE6;rke m&#xE6;nd skulde da m&#xF8;des i Kj&#xF6;benhavn og pr&#xF8;ve kr&#xE6;fter. Dagen kom, og de fik fat i hinanden. F&#xF6;rst sank Kristen S&#xF8; i kn&#xE6;erne, men s&#xE5; siger han: "Hov, hov! De skal huske p&#xE5;, jeg er en gammel mand, lad os f&#xE5; rigtig ved hinanden!" men denne gang strakte Kristen S&#xF8; Engelskmanden hen ad gulvet, og s&#xE5; sagde han: "Lad os pr&#xF8;ve det en gang endnu."

    <english_publication>One time, Kristen S&#xF8; from Voldby tried his strength against England&#x2019;s strongest man. The count at Frisenborg was in Copenhagen and was also up to visit the king. Here he met an English general with whom he fell into conversation. The general told him that he had a man who was so strong that nobody could beat him, and so they called him the &#x201C;Giant Wrestler.&#x201D; Then the count says that on his estate there was a man he didn&#x2019;t think the Giant Wrestler could beat, but the general thought it would be easy. The end of it was that the count sent a message to Frisenborg, and the general sent a message to England, that the two strong men were to meet in Copenhagen and try their strength. The day arrived, and they take hold of one another. First, Kristen S&#xF8; sank to his knees, but then he says, &#x201C;Hold on! You have to remember that I&#x2019;m an old man, let&#x2019;s get a good grip on each other!&#x201D; but that time Kristen S&#xF8; laid the Englishman flat out on the ground, and then he said: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s try that again.&#x201D; The Englishman had to take one more trip to the ground. For that piece of work, Kristen S&#xF8; got two hundred rixdollars from the count.</english_publication>

Det gjaldt da om at f&#xE5; den sl&#xE5;et ihjel. Men der var ingen, som turde binde sig ved den. S&#xE5; kom de i tanker om at l&#xE6;gge en tyrekalv til, og opfostre den med nymalket m&#xE6;lk i tre &#xE5;r. Folkene i Hvidbj&#xE6;rg sogn leverede m&#xE6;lk i f&#xE6;llesskab dertil, og i denne tid turde ingen mennesker komme i kirken. Da tiden nu var omme, var tyren bleven stor og st&#xE6;rk og skulde nu sl&#xE5;s med uhyret. S&#xE5; blev tyren lukket ind i kirken, og folkene stod udenfor i massevis for at f&#xE5; enden at vide. Nu blev der et forf&#xE6;rdeligt spektakel, og tyren br&#xF8;lte, s&#xE5; kirken rystede, men efter en tids forl&#xF8;b blev alt stille derinde, og nogle af de modigste kravlede op i vinduerne for at se, om uhyret var blevet dr&#xE6;bt.

Then it was important to get it killed. But there was nobody who dared go up against it. Then they decided to use a bull calf, and raise it on newly milked milk for three years. The people in Hvidbj&#xE6;rg provided the milk for that communally and during that time nobody dared go into the church. Now when the time was up, the bull had become big and strong and was to fight the monster. Then the bull was let into the church and the people stood in a crowd outside to find out the end. There was an incredible row and the bull snorted so loud that the church shook but after a while everything grew quiet in there and some of the bravest crawled up to the windows to see if the monster had been killed. Then they saw that both the lindorm and the bull lay dead and swam in their own blood. Then they opened the church door in a rush and dragged the dead bodies out. They got the lindorm down to the fjord and into a boat and they sailed with it to a little island, and buried it there and that island has been called Lind&#xF8; ever since.</english_publication>

Uden videre kom der bud efter Kristen S&#xF8;, og han kom strags. Greven spurgte, om han vilde tjene hans rest (restance med landgilde) i dag. Ja, den kunde han vel ikke tjene i dag, for han var omtrent en 70 daler &#xE6;bag. Jo, s&#xE5;dan og s&#xE5;dan var det, og kunde han l&#xE6;gge kusken til jorden, var hans rest ham eftergivet, men hvis ikke, skulde han betale om en m&#xE5;ned. Ja, s&#xE5; vilde han se, hvad han kunde. De kommer nu ud i borgg&#xE5;rden, og der f&#xE5;r de tag p&#xE5; hinanden. Der var ikke stenpikket, og det f&#xF6;rste tag, de tog, der bryder Kj&#xF6;benhavneren ham p&#xE5; det ene kn&#xE6;. Men s&#xE5; stod han op med det samme og kylte kusken fra sig, ligesom n&#xE5;r de kyler en dreng. S&#xE5; sp&#xF6;rger han, om de skulde pr&#xF8;ve igjen. Nej, kusken br&#xF8;d sig ikke om det mere. S&#xE5; sp&#xF6;rger greven ham om, hvordan det var, han lod sig bryde &#xE5; det ene kn&#xE6;. Det skulde han sige dem. Han havde haft fat i mange, men han var aldrig vant til at bruge uden det halve af hans styrke, siden s&#xE5; det hele. Men her var den bedste, han havde haft ved l&#xE6;nge, og s&#xE5; matte han til at tage ved det hele. Greven han vandt jo v&#xE6;ddem&#xE5;let, og Kristen S&#xF8; blev hans restancer givet efter.
Greven havde en ridehest, de ikke kunde f&#xE5; bagskoet, og der skulde s&#xE5; bud, du v&#xE9;d, efter denher Kristen S&#xF8;. S&#xE5; siger greven, om han kunde holde den hest op, mens smeden skoede den. Jo, men han vilde ikke svare til, om hesten tog nogen skade. Det gjorde ikke noget, sagde greven, den var betalt, han kom selv til at tage tabet. N&#xE5;, han holder, og smeden lagde skoen under, men da han slap, var l&#xE5;ret rykket af, hesten kunde hverken st&#xF8;de eller st&#xE5;.
     Hovfolkene de havde jo s&#xE5;dan sl&#xE6;tgilder, og de skulde have deres visse t&#xF8;nder &#xF8;l at drikke. S&#xE5; havde de bud oppe, om de kunde f&#xE5; mere. Ja, de kunde f&#xE5; det, en mand kunde b&#xE6;re. S&#xE5; var de jo lige s&#xE5; kloge som s&#xE5;, de f&#xE5;r Kristen S&#xF8; af sted.

    <english_publication>A person from Copenhagen had driven over to visit the count at Frisenborg. Then he tells him about his coachman, that he was so strong that no one could knock him to the ground. Then the count says that there was someone on his manor that he believed could do it. Now they made a big bet about it. Kristen S&#xF8; was sent for without delay and he came immediately. The count asked if he wanted to earn his outstanding debt today. Well, he didn&#x2019;t think he could earn it today because he was about seventy rixdollars in arrears. Well, it was like this and that, and if he could lay the driver to the ground, his debt was forgiven but, if not, he had to pay within the month. Well, he&#x2019;d see what he could do. They go out into the castle courtyard, and they grab hold of one another. It wasn&#x2019;t cobblestone there, and with the first grasp, the one from Copenhagen gets Kristen down on one knee. But then Kristen stood up and immediately tossed the coachman away, just as when you toss a boy. Then he asked him if wanted to try again. No, the coachman didn&#x2019;t want to do that any more. Then the count asks Kristen how it was that he let him force him down on one knee. He&#x2019;d tell him. He&#x2019;d gotten into it with a lot of others, but he had never had to use more than half of his strength, and certainly never all of it. But here was the best one he&#x2019;d encountered in a long time, and so he had to use all his strength. The count won the bet, and Kristen&#x2019;s debt was forgiven. The count had a riding horse, they couldn&#x2019;t shoe it, and so they sent for, you know, this guy Kristen S&#xF8;. The count asks him if he can hold the horse up while the smith shod it. Sure, but he couldn&#x2019;t be responsible if the horse got hurt. That didn't matter, said the count, it was paid for, he&#x2019;d take the loss himself. Well, he holds and the smith shod it, but when he let go, the horse's one thigh had gone out of joint, and the horse could neither kick nor stand.
     The villeinage folk they had their parties out on the fields, and they were supposed to have a certain number of kegs of beer to drink. They sent a message up and asked if they could have more. Yes, they could have as much as a man could carry. Well, they were pretty smart, so they send Kristen S&#xF8; off to get it. He takes a cask under each arm, and a half barrel in each hand, and then they had plenty for their party. 
     Kristen S&#xF8; had a couple of cows, and one day he had someone drive his dung out to the fields. This man said that he shouldn&#x2019;t put too much on the wagon, because his horses couldn&#x2019;t pull it all out of the dung pool&#x2014;it was apparently a very deep hole. Well, if there was nothing else to do about that, then Kristen said that he could pull it out himself. And he did that too each time, and the man would harness his horses up at the top of the hole.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Br&#xE6;sten og i Skibet var der ikke mere end et enkelt menneske levende efter pesten i hvert sogn, og det var en karl og en lille pige. Der var n&#xE6;sten skov over det hele, og de havde vanskeligt ved at finde hinanden. S&#xE5; ringede de med kirkeklokken, han i Br&#xE6;sten og hun i Skibet, og s&#xE5; gik de efter lyden. Han traf hende p&#xE5; en h&#xF6;j banke, hvor hun sad og gr&#xE6;d, og den banke hedder endnu Gr&#xE6;debj&#xE6;rg.

    <english_publication>In Br&#xE6;sten and Skibet there was not more than a single person alive after the plague in each parish, and it was a young man and a little girl. There was forest over practically the entire area, and they had a hard time finding each other. So they rang the church bells, he the one in Br&#xE6;sten and she the one in Skibet and they went after the sound. He found her on top of a high hill where she sat crying, and that hill is still called Crying hill (Gr&#xE6;debj&#xE6;rg). Others say that they met each other on a hill between Vilstrup and Ruu which is called Glass mountain (Glasbj&#xE6;rg). They got married and it is said that the area&#x2019;s population descends from them.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Jebj&#xE6;rg var en provst, der hed Nielsen. Han var kj&#xF8;rende til Hjerk pr&#xE6;steg&#xE5;rd i bes&#xF8;g, og da han kj&#xF8;rte tilbage over Tingg&#xE5;rds bro i Vium, kunde det ene baghjul ikke g&#xE5; rundt, for Fanden holdt det. S&#xE5; sagde provsten til hans karl, at han skulde st&#xE5; af og tage hjulet af og l&#xE6;gge i vognen, og s&#xE5;dan kj&#xF8;rte de hjem. S&#xE5; vilde provsten pr&#xF8;ve at mane Fanden, men han kunde ikke f&#xE5; ham til at g&#xE5; ned. Han tog nu 14 dages henstand, og s&#xE5; fik han bud til en nabopr&#xE6;st, at han skulde komme og hj&#xE6;lpe ham. Den gang dagen kom, lod provsten sin karl kj&#xF8;re hen og hente pr&#xE6;sten. Denne sagde nu til karlen, da han kj&#xF8;rte, at han ikke m&#xE5;tte tale med ham, og da de kom til Vium Tingg&#xE5;rds (?) bro, befalede han karlen at kj&#xF8;re alt hvad han kunde, for Fanden var foran dem. Da de kom til et lille hus uden for Jebj&#xE6;rg, sloges provsten der med den Slemme. Pr&#xE6;sten kom ham nu til hj&#xE6;lp, og de gjente Fanden over til provstens havedige, hvor han blev manet ned, og der blev lagt en stor sten over ham. Den sten er f&#xF8;rst bleven tagen op for nogle &#xE5;r siden, og det var Fandens mindesten. Der var skrevet en del romerskrift p&#xE5; den.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>In Jebj&#xE6;rg there was a curate who was called Nielsen. He was driving over to Hjerk parsonage to visit, and when he drove back over Tingg&#xE5;rds bridge in Vium, the back wheel wouldn't turn because the devil was holding onto it. Then the curate said to his farmhand that he should get off and take the wheel and put it up in the wagon, and that's how they drove home. Then the curate wanted to try to conjure the devil, but he couldn't get him to go down. He took fourteen days off, and sent a message to a neighboring minister that he should come and help him. When the day came, the curate had his farmhand drive over and get the minister. When he got up in the wagon, the minister said to the farmhand  that he mustn't speak to him, and when they got to Vium Tingg&#xE5;rds bridge, he ordered the farmhand to drive as fast as he could because the devil was ahead of them. When they got to a little house outside of Jebj&#xE6;rg, the curate was already fighting the Evil One there. The minister went to his aid and they chased the devil over to the curate's garden wall where he was conjured down, and a big stone was placed over him. That stone was moved away just a few years ago, and that was a monument to the devil. There were a bunch of Roman numerals on it.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>My mother's father and another man went down to the sea one morning and wanted to fish. Some more people were supposed to come, and since they'd gotten there too early, they lay down on the beach near the boats. Then two women come running along the beach from the east, and they turned and looked behind themselves. Now, they didn't see these two who were lying there, and then they said to each other: "He can't catch us, because he's lousy (has lice)" Not too much later someone comes riding along and he asked the men if they hadn't seen something. They say yes, they'd seen these two women, and they had said to each other that he couldn't catch them because he was lousy. Then he gets off the horse, pisses in his hands, and wipes himself with the water, and then he rides off again. It doesn't take too long before he comes back, and he had them with him on the back of his horse. They hung each to one side and were tied together by their hair.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A man, who lived south of Nibe, he told about how his parents had a field which went all the way up to Nibe field, and he had worked there as a shepherd out on the heath and had seen that there were seven graves in which seven robbers were buried. Those robbers had gone into a farmer one Christmas eve, and he quickly realized what kind of people they were, since they each had a rifle. So then they sat down at the table, and it was set for them, and they got both food and drink. But in the meantime the farmer sent his wife out the back way and she went over to a manor farm, which is called Lundb&#xE6;k. There were soldiers stationed there at that time, but there were only six, and those six didn&#x2019;t dare take on such a task. So they sent a messenger over to &#xD8;land, they also had six. It happened rather luckily that the fjord was frozen so they could get across it on the ice. While his wife was away, the man went and poured well for his guests. They had put down their flintlock rifles, and so he filled the glasses all the way up so that they spilled over and with that opportunity he spilled some on the rifles. When the other soldiers came from &#xD8;land, they were eleven all together and they stood outside and yelled hurrah! Then the robbers grabbed their rifles and wanted to shoot but they couldn&#x2019;t because the man had spilled moonshine on the gunpowder. All seven of them were caught and then they were executed and buried out on the heath.</english_publication>

En aften traf det sig da hverken v&#xE6;rre eller bedre, end at de m&#xF6;dtes hver med en god ladning korn. Nu sloges de, til det stod efter, men enden blev, at nissen fra Nebbe m&#xE5;tte give sig, og han blev dr&#xE6;bt. Nu tumlede den &#xD8;dsted nisse sig s&#xE5;dan ovre p&#xE5; Nebbe, at de m&#xE5;tte flytte g&#xE5;rden lidt bort, da nissen s&#xE5; ingen magt havde.

    <english_publication>Nebbeg&#xE5;rd no longer stands where it used to, and the reason for that is the following: Nebbeg&#xE5;rd and &#xD8;sterg&#xE5;rd both had a nisse. These two did not have good relations with each other because, to enrich their masters, they stole grain from each other. One night they wound up meeting each other, and each one had a giant cargo of stolen grain. Now they fought for a long time, but the end result was that the nisse from Nebbe had to give in and he was killed. Then the &#xD8;dsted nisse trounced all over Nebbe, so they were forced to move the farm a little ways away so the nisse wouldn&#x2019;t have any power. They did that, and since then there was peace.</english_publication>

They didn't like him, because they could never relax since he often was two places at the same time. The mill often ran in the middle of the night, and when people got up to investigate, it was nothing.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There's a story about a minister on Bornholm who, one night, when he was driving home past the cemetery, noticed that things weren't quite right in there. He told his coachman to stop while he went in there, and he said that if he didn't come back before the lantern they had with them burned out, he should drive, since he wouldn't be coming back ever again. The coachman did as he was asked, but he saw a terrible sight there in the cemetery. He could see the minister standing there conjuring someone down, who was standing on the bottom of a barrel, and fire was all around them. Later, when the lantern was just about to go out, the minister came running with his tongue hanging out and they drove home. The same story is told about another minister with the one difference that he put a candle in his room and said that if he didn't come back before it burned out then he'd never come back again.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Sometimes, early in the spring, one can see a whole lot of grass snakes hanging along the fences, there can be several hundred. They are seeking advice, the king grass snake sits right in the middle of them, but it isn't too easy to see him. But whoever could kill the king snake and eat the fat, he would become very rich and wise. A boy by the name of Anders went around asking for a little bit of food, and came through the forest where a king grass snake lived. He didn't think about it, but cut himself a hazel switch to support himself, and went on his way. One day he came to a wise minister who asked where he'd gotten the switch. He told him. The minister offered that he could stay there and get good food and a warm bed to sleep in at night if he'd show him the place. The boy promised he would, and the next day they went there. The minister told him that he should go home now, because now he could handle it alone. After that, he led the king snake up, and he carried it home and cooked it in a big pot. The next day, the boy came out to the kitchen where the pot stood, and he wasn't hungry, but since there was a bread crust on the table, he took it and dipped it in the fat that was floating on top, and ate it. At that moment the minister came and chased him out the door. "Things were good for you," he said, "but now you took what I wanted, so now you can get lost, now you've also become far wiser than me." The boy became so incredibly wise (cunning) and rich as well, so he traveled up to the forest's edge and bought himself a farm that was called Br&#xF8;dg&#xE5;rd [Bread farm], and there was a lot of talk about this Anders Br&#xF8;dg&#xE5;rd.</english_publication>

Finally he came up with the idea of covering his entire room with down comforters. Now when his time had run out, the Devil came sure enough and it only helped a little bit that the soft comforters could cushion the sinner, because now he danced around the room with him so that soon there wasn&#x2019;t a stump left of neither the comforters nor the manor lord. The blood, which splattered about on the walls, can never be cleaned off and can even be seen now.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There was a farmer who lived in Dybb&#xF8;l, who every evening would leave a bowl of porridge out on the mill stone for a little nisse who lived there at the farm. One evening, the girl had put the porridge on top and the butter on the bottom... Nothing else to do than to find a cow that was exactly like the one he'd killed. But it wasn't that easy to find one, and he first found one way up in Als. Nonetheless, he managed to have everything arranged by the next morning. When the girl was to water the cows, the cow couldn't find its stall. She got mad about that and hit it. Then the little nis came and said, "You mustn't hit it, because it isn't used to this," and with that he had to tell the girl everything.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En g&#xE5;rdmand i Dybb&#xF8;l stod i et meget venligt forhold til nogle sm&#xE5; nisser, som boede der i n&#xE6;rheden, og disse bragte bestandig s&#xE5; meget til g&#xE5;rde, at der var stor rigdom d&#xE9;r. Da manden s&#xE5; d&#xF8;de, kom en dag en lille nisse til s&#xF8;nnen og spurgte, om han vilde st&#xE5; i det samme forhold til dem, som hans fader. Det vilde s&#xF6;nnen ikke svare p&#xE5;, uden nissen kunde sige ham, hvor hans fader var. Det kunde nissen nok, ti hans fader var hos dem. "Nej," sagde s&#xF6;nnen, "s&#xE5; vil jeg ikke have noget med jer at bestille." Men nu sagde nissen: Ja, hvis han ikke vilde det, s&#xE5; m&#xE5;tte han ogs&#xE5; finde sig i, at de bar alt det bort igjen, som de havde b&#xE5;ret til i hans faders tid. S&#xF6;nnen bad da om, at det ikke m&#xE5;tte ske p&#xE5; &#xE9;n gang, men lidt efter lidt, Dette lovede nissen ham ogs&#xE5; for hans faders skyld. Efter den tid blev der stor fattigdom p&#xE5; g&#xE5;rden, og det har der v&#xE6;ret bestandig siden.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A farmer in Dybb&#xF8;l was really friendly with a group of small nisser, who lived nearby, and they constantly brought so much to the farm that there was great wealth there. When the man died, a little nisse came one day to the son and asked if he wanted to have the same arrangement that his father had had. The son wouldn&#x2019;t answer that unless the nisse could tell him where his father was. The nisse could answer that well enough, his father was with them. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; said the son, &#x201C;then I don&#x2019;t want to have anything to do with you.&#x201D; But now the nisse said: Well, if you don&#x2019;t want that, then he&#x2019;d also have to accept that they took everything away again which they had brought to his father in his time. The son asked them not to do it all at once, but little by little. The nisse promised to do this for his father&#x2019;s sake. After that time, there was great poverty at the farm, and it has been like that ever since.</english_publication>

She had to leave by the door, and when she got out, she looked through all the windows, but he hid behind a post until he saw her. She kept looking through the windows, but the moment he saw her, then he stood out in the open and said that she could see him now. After that time, she could never come to the farm except by the church road, and then through the gate and then the main door. She tried to come in all sorts of other places but couldn't. No one found out what kind of tricks the cunning man had done, but since then nothing died at the farm.</english_publication>

He had certainly seemed strange to her on the trip, but she answered, "Why should I be afraid when I am with you?"

But if you say the wrong name, it is very dangerous, because then they can bewitch you and turn you into a monster.

Now they could pretty much see who it was that they were dealing with and so they secretly sent the hired girl off to get the minister, but continued to play just like there was nothing wrong. A little later the minister came in through the door with the bible under his arm and said, &#x201C;Good evening everybody except for one!&#x201D; Then the strange man asked who it was and the minister said: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s you, you wretch!&#x201D; The stranger began to beg that he had to go now, if he couldn&#x2019;t be allowed to leave up through the chimney. &#x201C;No&#x201D; says the minister, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s way too big a place for you to go through.&#x201D; And then he cut a little hole in the window putty near the glass and said that now he had to go out that way. The devil, because that&#x2019;s who it was, turned into smoke and traveled out through the hole, but then there was such a stink after he left, that they couldn&#x2019;t bear to stay in the room. After that time the farmhands stopped playing cards and swearing, and the inn got the name, &#x201C;The Ace of Clubs Inn&#x201D;.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Poul Lyne in S&#xF8;nderskov had sworn himself to the devil. One time he was supposed to go to a birthing over in Ty and it was during the winter. When they drove off, there was a dog lying in the back of the wagon. Then when they were going to go home, they wanted to drive over the ice. But then they came to a big crack, and the driver didn&#x2019;t dare drive over it. &#x201C;Drive ahead, damn you! [lit.: for the devil]" yelled Paul. &#x201C;No, I will not drive in his name, I will drive in Jesus&#x2019;s name.&#x201D; Then he drove, but everything sank under the ice. The farmhand came up and came ashore alive. He said he could hear the horses breathing down there. After that time, Paul Lyne walked again and they could hear him coming in his high boots. He was conjured down by a curate in Gudum.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Syd for landevejen mellem Ringe og Nyborg i Jens Andersens mark overfor "B&#xE6;ksmedens" hus findes en lille mose, som kaldes Klokkemose eller Klokkelong. Om oprindelsen til dette navn fort&#xE6;lles f&#xF8;lgende: Medens klokket&#xE5;rnet endnu stod over den vestlige kirkehv&#xE6;lving, skete det en dag, da der ringedes over et lig, at klokkerebet blev revet ud af h&#xE6;nderne p&#xE5; den mand, der ringede, og klokken fl&#xF6;j ud af lydhullet og sank ned i n&#xE6;vnte mose, hvor den siges at ringe de h&#xF6;jtidsaftener.

    <english_publication>South of the highway between Nyborg and Ringe in Jens Andersen's field across the way from B&#xE6;ksmeden&#x2019;s house there is a small swamp, which is called Bell swamp or Bell sump. The following is told concerning the origin of that name: During the time when the bell tower was above the western church arch, one day while they were ringing for a corpse, the bell rope was torn out of the hands of the man who was ringing, and the bell flew out of the sound holes and sank down in the named swamp, where it is said to ring on the high holy days. During the time that they were moving the tower, they often heard a sound from the swamp as if they were ringing a bell in the distance.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A smith and his wife lived well together and were hardworking folks, but then he fell ill and lay in bed for two years. They had a journeyman, and he could take care of the work, so the customers continued to come there. The woman felt that it cost too much with her husband lying about and finally became nasty toward him. At the same time, she became closer to the journeyman, and they decided to kill the man. The journeyman was to make a long nail for her, and she convinced him that she was going to bang it in some place so she could hang something on it. After he'd made it, she talked to him about banging it into the smith's head, and then they would have each other. She held the nail and he hit it, and then they got married and lived together for thirty years. Then one day, the gravedigger was digging at the cemetery, as he so often did, and he dug up the skull with the nail in it, and he realized that something had been covered up here. He carried the skull down to the minister, and the gravedigger was so old that he could remember who was buried there. The minister sends for the woman and asks if she could recognize her husband. No, there was no reason to talk about that since he'd been dead for thirty years. Then he came with the skull and showed it to her, and then she could recognize him. They both got to suffer their punishment here in this life, both the journeyman and the wife.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A woman lived in Bjerge, Bjerge district, she could witch, and many people had seen that she could milk using two forks. Sometimes when she was to have milk she'd let her black milk can, which she was going to put the milk in, walk along in front of her. Then she didn't have to carry it, and then she could walk and knit stockings in the meantime. But not everything she did was good. There was a farm called Easter farm where a number of cows died without them knowing what was going on. Then the man started to think that there must be some witch or another who was causing this misfortune with his cattle. Well, what does he do, he goes and gets in touch with a cunning man and asks his advice. The cunning man knew right away what to do, and told the man that he should take nine different types of wood and burn them in a bonfire. Then the one who was at fault in the cows' death would come, but they had to be careful that she didn't see the fire. They did as the cunning man had advised them to, and then the witch from Bjerge quickly came over there. She complained and howled and wanted to come inside, but they had to be careful that she didn't come in and see the fire, because then her pain would be gone immediately. The witch had to stay outside, and she was tormented and got so hot that she jumped into the dung heap to cool herself down. Finally, the nine kinds of wood were burned up, and then the witch could run home again; but she could never hurt Easter farm again.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There was supposed to have been robbers in R&#xF8;rb&#xE6;k forest in Vester parish. It is said that they had a rope tied across the road that went through the forest. When somebody touched it, a bell rang down in their den, at which point they&#x2019;d fly up and attack the traveler. One time a man came driving down the road with his wife and children. The robbers noticed this, so they attacked them and killed them all except for the little child, whom they didn't have the heart to kill. But a little bit later a robber, who had been away, and who was called J&#xF8;rgen, came home. When he saw the child he said: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s this youngster; I&#x2019;ll soon nick him!&#x201D; at which point he grabbed the child and killed it. After that time, all the other robbers called him &#x201C;J&#xF8;rgen Nick.&#x201D;</english_publication>

A little bit away from the church, he saw something walking towards him in the middle of the road, and he thought it was a big dog, but when he got closer to it, it looked a lot like a gray sheep. He moved to the side of the road and it walked quickly down the middle of the street right past him, and he could clearly see that it had red eyes which were glowing. He got a little hot around the ears, even though it didn&#x2019;t do anything to him, but he continued along the way to Hindskov. Others are also supposed to have seen that figure like a sheep.</english_publication>

The other farmhands wondered where he was, and so they went home to get pry bars and other tools to get him out. He was down in the cellar and could answer them. So they began to dig out the cobblestones outside. Speitzer and the manager noticed that and so they went and released the farmhand voluntarily. That same night, all the farmhands fled the parish, because they knew that they&#x2019;d all be punished as a group the next day, and they were never heard from again.</english_publication>

They began to grab and take what there was, but they they should have realized that there was something wrong, since the entire crew was dead, and it wasn&#x2019;t too long before they all got sick and the disease drifted in over the entire country.

S&#xE5; paste min morbroder Jens Mikkelsen f&#xE5;r p&#xE5; den samme mark. En dag finder han et hul ned i jorden, og da han nu r&#xE6;kker hans kj&#xE6;p ned, s&#xE5; er der noget, der klingrer, ligesom det kunde v&#xE6;re s&#xF8;lvpenge.

Da han nu kom tilbage, var ingen af delene at finde. Den jord, hvorp&#xE5; det skete, kaldes Korsbakken. P&#xE5; den samme mark l&#xE5; en flad sten, der var omtrent 5 kvarter p&#xE5; hver m&#xE5;de, og der var vel et par tommer muld over den. A kunde lige skrufle over den med ploven. A s&#xE5; egentlig ikke p&#xE5; den, men det var let at se, hvor det var, for om sommeren, n&#xE5;r den indt&#xE6;gt l&#xE5; i gr&#xE6;smark, gik gr&#xE6;sset p&#xE5; den ud.

    <english_publication>My mother wanted to go from Vole to Flensted in foggy weather. Then she got lost, and then she came to a stone with red letters on it, but she couldn&#x2019;t read them. Then my mother&#x2019;s brother Jens Mikkelsen was watching sheep on the same field. One day he finds a hole down into the ground, and when he stretches his staff down into the hole, there is something that jingles, just like it could be silver coins. So now he wants to check it out, but first he wanted to make sure that the sheep didn&#x2019;t wander into harm, and when he saw that he&#x2019;d have to go out and get them, he left his staff in the hole, and his clogs next to it. When he got back, he couldn&#x2019;t find any of his things. The ground where this happened is called Korsbakken. In the same field there was a flat stone, which was about thirty inches on each side, and there was a couple of inches of sod on top of it. I could just scrape over it with the plow. I never looked at it, but it was easy to see where it was, because during the summer when everything was covered with grass, the grass on it died. Finally I came to think about that, at that time I'd heard a lot of talk about a treasure, and so I wanted to check the stone out, but then we couldn&#x2019;t find it. It had sunk down. I&#x2019;ve dug for it later but I&#x2019;ve never been able to find it. It&#x2019;ll probably come to light at some point, but it's possible that the person who is supposed to find it hasn&#x2019;t been born yet.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Den kloge pr&#xE6;st i Snoldelev havde en gammel kusk, der somme tider holdt og bedede i Damhuskroen, hvor omkring dem fra Br&#xF8;ndbyvester havde et vejstykke at holde i stand.

S&#xE5; siger pr&#xE6;sten til ham: "Tag fat p&#xE5; t&#xF6;mmen med h&#xF6;jre h&#xE5;nd, s&#xE5; langt ude, du kan n&#xE5;." Det gjorde kusken, men det hjalp ikke. "St&#xE5; s&#xE5; af og tag hovedt&#xF6;jet af den fjermer hest." Det gjorde han. "Kan du nu ikke se noget bag p&#xE5; vognen?" sagde pr&#xE6;sten igjen.

Da de n&#xE5;ede hjem til pr&#xE6;steg&#xE5;rden, sagde pr&#xE6;sten: "Nu kan du g&#xE5;, for nu har du f&#xE5;et noget for din ulejlighed."

    <english_publication>The wise minister in Snoldelev had an old driver who sometimes stopped and rested in Damhus Inn, near where the people from Br&#xF8;ndbyvester had a piece of road they were responsible for repairing. He told a story that one time when they had been out on a trip (probably to see about some sort of witchcraft), the horses all of a sudden became stubborn, reared, and wouldn't go anywhere. Then the minister says to him, "Grab hold of the reins with your right hand as far out as you can." The driver did that, but it didn't help. "Get down and take the harness off the far horse." He did that. "Can't you see anything on the back of the wagon?" the minister said again. Well, now the driver could clearly see that there was a devil sitting in the back there. "Take off the right back wheel and put it up in the wagon, and then drive as fast as you can home." When they got home to the parsonage, the minister said, "Now, can you leave, because now you've gotten something for your difficulties." That was to the devil, he said that, because it was him who had to be the fourth wheel for the wagon after the wheel had been taken off. Since then, nothing ever went wrong when they were out driving. 
Hr. Andr. Tamdrup Rachlou was the minister here from 1769-1789 and again from 1802-1811.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A werewolf looked like a normal wolf except that it only had three legs. It was a cursed man, who during the day was like everyone else, but on certain nights became a werewolf and wandered widely about. A person could be freed from this unfortunate condition by eating a child's heart. Pregnant women therefore would only under great duress walk alone at night, but even if they had but a little boy with them, then the werewolf had no power. In the same way, a werewolf could be freed if someone said to it when it attacked a pregnant woman, "You're a werewolf!"</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Min gamle bedstefader fortalte mig i min barndom, at da sognefolkene en s&#xF8;ndag morgen kom til Toksv&#xE6;rd kirke p&#xE5; Sj&#xE6;lland, da l&#xE5; der uden for d&#xF6;ren et frygteligt uhyre, som kaldtes en lindorm. Ingen turde n&#xE6;rme sig den, s&#xE5; man den dag med sorg m&#xE5;tte g&#xE5; hjem uden at kunne komme i kirke. Kun &#xE9;n af m&#xE6;ndene gik op i t&#xE5;rnet og sk&#xF8;d med kraft p&#xE5; uhyret, men alt prellede af p&#xE5; dets tykke skind. Man fik da en tyrekalv til pr&#xE6;steg&#xE5;rden, og sognets folk bragte m&#xE6;lk og blod til den at drikke. I f&#xE5; m&#xE5;neder voksede den s&#xE5; st&#xE6;rkt, at den blev helt uvane og spr&#xE6;ngte til sidst staldd&#xF8;ren, sprang over p&#xE5; kirkeg&#xE5;rden og rev uhyret ihjel. I den tid, da kalven voksede, gik man dog i kirke, idet man fik lavet en d&#xF6;r i den nordre side, og den anden blev s&#xE5; muret efter. Nu er indgangen i den vestre ende.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>My old grandfather told me when I was a child that the parish people came one Sunday to Toksv&#xE6;rd church on Sj&#xE6;lland, and there they found a frightening monster, which was called a lindorm, lying outside the door. Nobody dared get near it, so that day they had to go home with great sorrow without being able to go to church. Only one of the men went up in the tower and took a hard shot at the monster, but everything bounced off its thick skin. They got a bull calf brought over to the parsonage and the parish people brought milk and blood for it to drink. Over the course of a few months it grew so strong that it became completely uncontrollable and finally smashed the stall door, then it jumped the cemetery wall and tore the monster to death. During the time that the calf was growing, they went to church by making a door in the north side and the other one was walled up. Now the entrance is on the west end.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>One day we couldn&#x2019;t get butter and churned for two or three days. The cream was viscous and good for nothing so we couldn&#x2019;t even use it for pancakes, but had to throw it away. Then an old Norwegian who went about with beehives comes by and he wants to beg for something to eat. My mother gave him some sour milk to spoon up and a bite of bread as well. &#x201C;This is some fine milk,&#x201D; he says now as he&#x2019;s sitting there. Yes, the milk was good enough, she says snappishly. He says it one more time. &#x201C;But we get nothing out of it,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;no matter how good it is.&#x201D; Yes, he could see that well enough. But now he&#x2019;d give them some advice. They should get a piece of iron forged with three holes in it. Then they should take some sulfur and drip it into each barrel they had. After that, they should get the iron glowing hot and pour the milk over the iron into each barrel. &#x201C;Then I think that the person who did this will get their nose warmed. If that doesn&#x2019;t help, I&#x2019;ll make it so it does help, but I don&#x2019;t really want to do that.&#x201D; It helped too.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>In a farm up in Sj&#xE6;llands odde, about forty years ago, there was really bad haunting. Once the people had a little foal which stood in a little barn and it was exactly there that the haunting was the worst. They noticed now that in the barn there was a little nook that both the mare and the foal avoided quite precisely, and it was also impossible for people to chase the animals into it. The people thought that something must be hidden in that nook because of things that weren&#x2019;t quite right there. So they broke up the floor and dug down in the ground where they found a human skeleton. They gathered the bones together and carried them up to the cemetery and buried them there and since that time there has never been a haunting in the farm.</english_publication>

When the minister got outside of the gate, he met the hired girl with the books, which he then took under his arm and went down to the meadow and said to J&#xF8;rgen, who was standing there with the calf: &#x201C;Now you can go home and, with God&#x2019;s help, I&#x2019;ll be back in the parsonage just as soon as you.&#x201D; When J&#xF8;rgen had made it a ways down the road, he stood still and listened, and he heard the minister say: &#x201C;Now you have knocked two books away from me, and if you can knock the third away from me, then you&#x2019;re more than a match for me.&#x201D; J&#xF8;rgen got scared now and hurried along, but soon afterward he heard a strange loud noise and, a moment later, the minister caught up with him so they accompanied each other back to the farm. J&#xF8;rgen saw then that he had a book under his arm and it was the bible. Since then, there has never been haunting in the parsonage.

Another man listened to the fisherman&#x2019;s story with indifference. &#x201C;Hmm...&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;it probably was nothing more than a big stone or the like.&#x201D; In the meantime, he researched exactly where the place was. The teller, who regretted his indiscretion, set out to get the chest up the next day, but everything had happened the night before. They were all from Brede, and they found out that the old coins that were found had been exchanged in Copenhagen. One could trace wealth in that family since then.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Da herredsfogden (Himmark?) i Harris d&#xF8;de, var der nogen snak om, at han gik igjen, og man fort&#xE6;ller, at han p&#xE5; begravelsesdagen var f&#xF6;r hjemme i sin g&#xE5;rd end ligf&#xF8;lget. Samme dags aften blev der banket h&#xE5;rdt p&#xE5; pr&#xE6;steg&#xE5;rdens d&#xF6;r i Brede, og pigen lukkede op, men der var ingen. Det bankede anden gang og endnu st&#xE6;rkere, og der var endnu ingen. Da sagde pr&#xE6;sten til pigen: "Banker det tredje gang, vil jeg selv g&#xE5; ud". Snart bankede det st&#xE6;rkere end f&#xF6;r, og pr&#xE6;sten gik da selv ud for at lukke op, og pigen, som lyttede, kjendte herredsfogdens r&#xF6;st, som sagde: "Min sag er tabt". Hans solgte ridehest fandtes n&#xE6;sten altid skumbed&#xE6;kket om morgenen af det natlige ridt, som den brugtes til af sin forrige ejer.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>When the district bailiff from Harris died, there was some talk about him walking again and they say that on the day of his funeral he arrived back at his house before the funeral procession. That same night, there was a loud knock at the door of the parsonage in Brede, and the serving girl opened the door, but nobody was there. There was a second knock, even louder than the first but, once again, there was nobody there. Then the minister said to the girl: &#x201C;If there is a third knock, I&#x2019;ll go out myself.&#x201D; Soon there was a louder knock than before, and the minister went to open the door himself, and the girl, who was listening, recognized the bailiff&#x2019;s voice who said: &#x201C;My case has been lost.&#x201D; The bailiff's riding horse, which had been sold after his death, was found almost every morning covered with foam from the nightly ride its previous owner (the bailiff) used it for.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Visby ved Tr&#xF6;jborg var der en kone, som mange ans&#xE5; for en heks. Vor nabo p&#xE5;stod, at han havde f&#xE5;et troen i h&#xE6;nde ved at pr&#xF8;ve et spil med hende. Hun kom der en gang, og da hun vilde g&#xE5;, sagde han: "Gud v&#xE6;re med jer!" S&#xE5; kom hun tilbage igjen og kunde ikke komme bort. Nu talte de om ligegyldige ting, og hun gik igjen, men han gjentog ordene fra f&#xF8;rste gang, og der stod hun atter og m&#xE5;tte vende om igjen. Det gjorde han tre gange, og tre gange kom hun tilbage, men s&#xE5; blev han n&#xE6;sten bange og sagde fjerde gang kun farvel, s&#xE5; kunde hun g&#xE5;. Det samme siges to korslagte syn&#xE5;le eller halmstr&#xE5; p&#xE5; d&#xF6;rtr&#xE6;et at kunne bevirke, og ingen heks kan overskride d&#xF6;rt&#xE6;rskelen, f&#xF6;r de borttages. Da bem&#xE6;ldte kone var d&#xF8;d, kom en person og puttede liget en tolvskilling i den &#xE5;bent st&#xE5;ende mund, som p&#xE5; begravelsesdagen &#xE5;rle blev afhentet for at l&#xE6;gges, gr&#xF6;n og &#xE6;kel som den var, i br&#xE6;ndevin, som en drukkenbolt skulde drikke, for at han kunde f&#xE5; lede til br&#xE6;ndevin.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>In Visby near Tr&#xF8;jborg there was a woman who many suspected of being a witch. Our neighbor claimed that he had proved this allegation by playing a little game with her. She came once, and when she was leaving, he said, &#x201C;God be with you!&#x201D; Then she came back again and couldn&#x2019;t leave. Now they talked about inconsequential things and she left again, but he repeated the words from the first time and then she stood there again and had to turn around again. He did that three times, and three times she came back, but then he got sort of scared and the fourth time he said only goodbye so she could leave. They also say that two needles or pieces of straw, placed in the shape of a cross on the threshold, has an effect so that no witch can cross the threshold until they&#x2019;re taken away. When this woman was dead, a person came and put a twelve shilling coin in the open mouth of her corpse which, on the day of burial, was retrieved early and, green and horrid as the coin was, was to be put into some moonshine, which a drunk was supposed to drink so he&#x2019;d become disgusted with moonshine.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Den gamle Blicher i Spentrup var en gang kj&#xF8;rt til en g&#xE5;rd i Gassum, hvor folkene hverken kunde spinde eller udrette huslig gjerning uden at blive forstyrret. Det trak ogs&#xE5; dynen af dem om natten. Derfor anmodede de pastor Blicher om at mane sp&#xF8;gelset, og han lovede det, men sagde, at de skulde ingen ting bryde dem om, f&#xF6;r han kom. Hans karl, Kristen, skulde kj&#xF8;re for ham, og han sagde til ham, at han ikke m&#xE5;tte kj&#xF8;re tilbage, f&#xF6;r han kom og slog ham p&#xE5; skulderen med de ord: Kj&#xF8;r nu i Jesu navn. Kusken sad p&#xE5; vognen og h&#xF8;rte noget, der hylede i g&#xE5;rden. S&#xE5; kom der noget og satte sig op og sagde: "Kj&#xF8;r nu, Kristen". Men han kj&#xF8;rte ikke. Anden gang og tredje gang. Da kom pr&#xE6;sten og sagde de rette ord. Da de nu kj&#xF8;rte hjem, kom de forbi Kjellerup m&#xF8;lle, og der er en stor bakke. "Du pisker s&#xE5; st&#xE6;rkt p&#xE5; hestene," siger pr&#xE6;sten. Ja, de kunde ikke tr&#xE6;kke vognen. "Tag s&#xE5; det frah&#xE5;nds hjul af." Da de kom ind i g&#xE5;rden, siger pr&#xE6;sten igjen: "V&#xE6;r mig nu tro, bitte Kristen. Sp&#xE6;nd du nu fra og g&#xE5; s&#xE5; ind og i din seng." Men da Kristen kom i seng, vilde han op og se efter, for der blev s&#xE5;dan en hylen og spektakel der ude. Da tog det ovret af laden og satte nok s&#xE5; p&#xE6;nt ned ved siden af. N&#xE6;ste morgen sagde pr&#xE6;sten: "Det kunde vi have v&#xE6;ret fri for, Kristen, n&#xE5;r du havde lyd mig."</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Old Blicher from Spentrup had driven to a farm in Gassum once where the people could neither spin nor take care of household work without being disturbed by a ghost. It also pulled the comforters off of them at night. Therefore they asked pastor Blicher to conjure the ghost, and he promised he&#x2019;d do that, but he said that they shouldn&#x2019;t worry about anything before he came. His farmhand, Kristen, was supposed to drive for him, and he said to him that he couldn&#x2019;t drive back until he came and hit him on the shoulder with the words: &#x201C;Drive now in Jesus&#x2019;s name.&#x201D; The driver sat on the wagon and heard something that howled in the farm. Then something came and sat in the wagon and said: &#x201C;Drive now, Kristen.&#x201D; But he didn&#x2019;t drive. A second time and a third time. Then the minister came and said the right words. Now while they drove home, they came past Kjellerup mill and there is a big hill there. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re whipping the horses so hard,&#x201D; says the minister. Well, they couldn&#x2019;t pull the wagon. &#x201C;Take the back wheel off then.&#x201D; When they got into the parsonage, the minister says again: &#x201C;Be faithful to me now, little Kristen. Uncouple the horses and then go in and go to bed.&#x201D; But when Kristen got into bed, he wanted to get up and see, since there was a great howling and row out there. Then it took the roof off of the barn and set it down squarely beside it. The next morning the minister said: &#x201C;We could have avoided that, Kristen, if you had listened to me.&#x201D;</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Det var den gang markerne blev udskift, da boede der &#xE9;n i Skindbj&#xE6;rg, der hed Knud, og han giver hans karl en rigsdaler for at flytte skjellet ned p&#xE5; hans nabo. Karlen skulde flytte skjellet seks alen, det var jo en ager, og naboen kaldte de Mads S&#xF6;rensen. Han flyttede s&#xE5; der fra Knud om November og flyttede til Horsens, og om sommeren efter fik han tyfus og d&#xF8;de deraf. Den gang han var s&#xE5; begravet, s&#xE5; s&#xF6;gte han tilbage til Knuds. Da Knud kom ud om aftenen, da stod han lige s&#xE5; kridhvid der uden til d&#xF6;ren. Knud vidste, hvad det bet&#xF8;d, og han lukkede d&#xF6;ren igjen. Men siden den tid hver gang de vandede &#xF8;g om aftenen, s&#xE5; de, han kom der op igjen lige s&#xE5; kridhvid, og folkene blev jo r&#xE6;dde for ham. Knud m&#xE5;tte nu op til pr&#xE6;sten og have ham derned. Degnen kaldte de Grejs Gr&#xE5;, og han var kusk for pr&#xE6;sten der til Skindbj&#xE6;rg. Den gang de havde v&#xE6;ret der nede lidt, s&#xE5; m&#xF8;der sp&#xF8;gelset. Denher Mads S&#xF6;rensen var ordret til at m&#xF8;de med en sparre, for han skulde v&#xE6;re til stede ved at flytte skjellet tilbage. Den gang s&#xE5; gjengangeren var m&#xF6;dt, s&#xE5; siger degnen til pr&#xE6;sten, om han vilde nu g&#xE5; ud til ham. Ja, han var ikke allermest want ved det. Ja, s&#xE5; vilde han, siger degnen, og s&#xE5; gik han ud til ham. Den gang de fik s&#xE5; talt sammen, siger degnen til Mads S&#xF6;rensen og Knud, at nu kunde de komme. Degnen f&#xF8;lger derp&#xE5; med d&#xF8;dningen hen til det sted, hvor han havde gravet hullet, og s&#xE5; dertil, hvor han havde flyttet skjellet fra. S&#xE5;dan blev de ved, til de kom skjellinien igjennem. S&#xE5; siger sp&#xF8;gelset, da de kom linien til ende: "Vil du tilgive mig, s&#xE5; vil Gud og tilgive dig." Mads sagde ja, og s&#xE5; lige med det samme var den anden forsvunden. Den gang de skulde til at hjem, s&#xE5; siger pr&#xE6;sten til degnen: Nu kunde han s&#xE6;tte sig op i hans s&#xE6;de, for han var hans mester. Han sagde f&#xF6;r du til ham, men nu sagde han I.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>It was at the time when the fields were partitioned, there was one who lived in Skindbj&#xE6;rg and he gives his farmhand a rixdollar to move the marker into his neighbor&#x2019;s field. The farmhand was supposed to move the marker twelve feet, that was an acre, and the neighbor was called Mads S&#xF8;rensen. The farmhand moved there from Knud in November and moved to Horsens, and the next summer he got typhus and died. Then when he was buried he sought his way back to Knud&#x2019;s place. When Knud came out at night, the farmhand stood right there, chalk white, outside the door. Knud knew what it meant and he closed the door again. But after that, every time he watered the jades in the evening, they saw that he came up again, just as chalk white, and the people were scared of him. Knud had to go up to the minister now and get him down there. They called the parish clerk Grejs Gr&#xE5; and he was the driver for the minister from Skindbj&#xE6;rg. When they had been down there a little bit, the ghost appears. This here Mads S&#xF8;rensen had been told to come along with a chevron, since he was supposed to be there to move the marker back again. Then when the revenant had come, the parish clerk says to the minister, that he should go out to him. Well, he really didn&#x2019;t want to. Then he&#x2019;ll do it, says the parish clerk, and then he went out to him. Then after they&#x2019;d talked together, the parish clerk says to Mads S&#xF8;rensen and Knud that they could come now. The parish clerk follows the dead farmhand now to the place where he had dug the hole and then to where he had moved the marker from. They continued that way until they had done the entire dividing line. Then the ghost says when they get to the end of the line: &#x201C;If you will forgive me, God will forgive you.&#x201D; Mads said yes, and then immediately the other one disappeared. Then when they were going to go home, the minister says to the parish clerk: Now he could get up in his seat, because he was his master. The minister used to say &#x201C;du&#x201D; (a less formal form of the second person pronoun) to him, now he said &#x201C;I&#x201D; (a more formal form of the second person pronoun).</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There was also a minister who was good at conjuring in Spentrup. One night he had driven out to a house where he was supposed to conjure a ghost. He drove as fast as he could until the wagon became so heavy that the horses couldn&#x2019;t pull it. He got out according to the minister&#x2019;s orders and put one of the wheels into the wagon. Now it went well until they got quite close to home, but then the farm hand went and put the wheel on again. It was too soon, since when they got into the parsonage, the minister noticed that something was wrong, and said to the farm hand that he should hurry and get the horses into the barn and to not come out of there until he called for him. But the farm hand was curious and looked out and then there was some evilness (haunting) which tipped the barn over before it went away, but it didn&#x2019;t get any power over the minister.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>P&#xE5; den sorte d&#xF8;ds tid strandede et fremmed skib p&#xE5; vestsiden af Ty. Af mandskabet var de fleste d&#xF8;de, men nogle kom dog levende i land, der iblandt en biskop fra England, som trak sig tilbage for strandboerne, der n&#xE6;rmede sig, og i frastand lod dem forst&#xE5;, at pesten havde raset om bord p&#xE5; deres skib, samt at han selv og de &#xF8;vrige skibsfolk, der var komne i land, var syge og uundg&#xE5;elig m&#xE5;tte d&#xF8;, hvorfor han advarede dem fra at komme n&#xE6;rmere.

    <english_publication>During the time of the black death, a foreign ship stranded on the west side of Thy. Most of the crew was dead, but some came ashore alive, among them a bishop from England, who held back from the people who lived there by the shore when they approached. He let it be known from a distance that the plague had raged aboard their ship and that he and the others who had made it ashore were sick and inevitably would die and so he warned them from coming any nearer. The people paid no attention to the warning and the result was that they were infected and then the plague spread even wider and also here in this country it resulted in great destruction. The legend tells lastly that the dead bishop was buried here in the cemetery. One can find another reminder of that sorrowful time there in the cemetery in a depression immediately to the south west of the church, which is still called the plague hole, where there are no traces of old graves even when their closest relatives have their graves at the cemetery.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There was an old woman who had sold her soul to the devil. Then her time was up, and the devil had gotten so far that he was combing her hair with a glowing comb, and it didn't help if she whined or sang, now she was to go with him. At that moment, a student came in who had gone to the black school and asked on her behalf if she couldn't be given an extension until the stump of candle that was burning on the table had burned out. The Evil One agreed to that, but then the student took the candle, put it out, and hid it, and then the devil had to leave without having finished his business.</english_publication>

Nevertheless he came with the hare, it had been felled by the shot. 
     That same man also liked to fish. Then he fished one time in M&#xF8;rk Lake, a little deep lake out on Vest heath, some people believe it is bottomless. But then it went wrong for him. Because that time he got a red spotted calf in his net and it tore it to pieces for him, and he had to go home that day with unfinished business.

    <english_publication>There was an old town herdsman in the town As&#xE5; who got his pay as long as he lived. There where he'd stayed, that's where he visited after he died, and he stood and scraped at a post in the barn. A careless lad got work there. Then the others told him that he shouldn't go out at such and such a time because that was when the herdsman came. "Well, I really want to talk to him," said this here lad. He goes out and the herdsman was there. "What are you doing here?" the lad said quite freely to him. "I'm looking for a twenty-four shilling piece." Then he went off and sat down on a rock way out on the heath. The boy followed behind him. "What are you sitting here for?" -- "Here is where my pay is." The boy went home now, and the next day he went out to the post in the barn. There was a split in it, and a twenty-four shilling piece tumbled out of that. "Well, then there must also be something to look for out by that stone," he thought. He had made a note of where the stone was, and then he went out to it one day and wanted to look around. He digs a bit underneath it and finds a sock and inside it was a whole lot of silver coins, several ten shilling pieces, that were used and considered as marks and stamped as twelve shilling pieces, and rigsorter (royal pieces) and two mark pieces and six shilling pieces, and some small change, but there was a lot. He took the sock with him and hid the money, and when he was free he bought himself a farm and became a rich man from the As&#xE5; herdsman's money. And since then they didn't see the revenant.</english_publication>

Konen lukkede op og gav ham en potte &#xF6;l (andre siger kj&#xE6;rnem&#xE6;lk) at drikke. P&#xE5; sine rejser undlod Fynshovedmanden ikke at betale for, hvad han modtog, s&#xE5;ledes ogs&#xE5; her. Da han ingen sm&#xE5;penge havde hos sig, sagde han til konen:
"V&#xE6;k, var dig, min pfert (hest) slar dig!"

    <english_publication>It is told that Valdemar Atterdag, under the name of Fynshoved man, made some hunting expeditions through the northern part of Fyn. He went through a farm in Egense on Hindsholm where there were two doors opposite each other, and at the time when people expected him, they left the doors open. When he came through the northernmost town, Norskov, on the trip to Fynshoved, he had gotten thirsty and he knocked on the door of a house to get something to drink. The woman opened the door and gave him a pitcher of beer (others say it was buttermilk) to drink. On his trips, Fynshoved man didn't forget to pay for what he received, and it was no different here. Since he didn't have any change, he said to the woman: "Go away with you, my horse will hit you!" The woman ran frightened inside, and at the same time there was a smack on the door. The next day the woman found a silver horseshoe embedded in the door.

    <english_publication>A woman from Nedre-Hornb&#xE6;k had gone to Randers with her two sons. When they were on their way home again, and just as they stepped out of Videm&#xF8;lle vold and had come back on the Hornb&#xE6;k property, she heard that it was ringing underneath them in the ground. So one of the boys ran home to get a shovel and he dug where it was ringing, and now it began to chime, and it chimed for three hours. Not too long after, the black plague broke out.

Hendes h&#xE5;r h&#xE6;ngte lige ned om hovedet af hende. "Hvad Fanden er dether?" siger karlen. Da rejser hun sig lige op og kommer l&#xF8;bende hen og springer op p&#xE5; det ene &#xF8;g, og s&#xE5; kj&#xF8;rer han l&#xF8;bsk. Anden dagen gik de hen ogs&#xE5; efter det, og da fandt de et barn, som var druknet. Det kvindfolk havde vel put barnet i &#xE5;en og m&#xE5;ske druknet sig selv bag efter.

    <english_publication>There was a farmhand who worked for a farmer, but if it was in Hvilsh&#xF8;j or in Kraghede, I can&#x2019;t say. The farmer was a bad one to drink. One day he wanted to go to Sundby with grain, and the farmhand was supposed to come along. Then he drank too much and the farmhand had to drive the wagon home, but the man lay in the back and was drunk. When they got to Jerslev bridge near Hvilsh&#xF8;j and the farmhand looks down into the river, there is a woman who stood swirling about in the water with her arms. &#x201C;What the devil is this?&#x201D; says the farmhand. Then she gets up and runs over and jumps up on one of the jades, and then it&#x2019;s a runaway horse. The next day they went out and then they found a child that had been drowned in the river. That woman had probably drowned the child and then drowned herself afterward. But there is nothing told about that. I think it was a portent that the child was to be found. It&#x2019;s supposed to be a true story.</english_publication>

Then the mouse runs over. On the other side, there was a big ant hill with horse ants, and the mouse runs into the ant hill. A little later it comes out and runs back into the mouth of the first farmhand. The second farmhand doesn't say a thing. "I had such a bad dream, and was in great danger," says the first farmhand. "What happened?" says the second one. "I had to get over a large body of water, and I couldn't, but then something came and laid a bridge, and I went over it, and over on the other side there was so much money, it was incredible the amount of money there was." The second farmhand still kept quiet and didn't say anything and they went home. Later, the second farmhand went back and dug the ant hill aside, and there he finds a pot filled with money. He took that and kept it for himself.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>When the mound dwellers got hold of a little girl from the human world through "changing," and she later became a mound man's wife, then she could not give birth to her children unless a Christian woman came and delivered her. That's how a little creature came riding to Vejvad in Vinding near Holstebro and wanted the woman there to come with him to his wife. The farmwife wasn't too excited about the trip, but the mound man said that she didn't need to be afraid as long as she sat on the horse differently than he did. She did that, and before she knew it, they were down at the mound man's place. She delivered the woman, and the man was so happy about that that he gave her a handful of wood shavings, she should save them so she could light the fire with them the next morning, he figured. The woman didn't understand what he meant, but she kept the shavings and when the mound man had pulled the horse up, sat up on it and asked her to get up as well, she did that, but she didn't forget to sit backwards since the mound man had sat down properly on the horse, and before she knew it, she was home again. When she looked at the shavings the next morning, they'd turned into heavy lumps of gold.</english_publication>

Alts&#xE5; skar de et par gode knipper og bandt dem sammen med en tynd hessel, lagde s&#xE5; hver sin foran sig p&#xE5; hesten og red tilbage. De havde af deher l&#xE5;dne kabudser p&#xE5; med stivt udst&#xE5;ende skygger og messingkant om b&#xE5;de kabuds og skygge. Som de nu bedst rider, siger Niels: "Der er ild i din kabuds, Per." &#x2014; "Det kan a int forst&#xE5;," siger han og ser sig om. "Men der er jo ogs&#xE5; ild i dit skj&#xE6;g og h&#xE5;r." S&#xE5; siger Niels: "Der er jo ogs&#xE5; ild i dine kj&#xE6;ppe." &#x2014; "Ja, det er nu det samme, a slipper dem ikke, f&#xF6;r a er n&#xF8;dt til. Lad os bede vort Fadervor." Det gjorde de, men det hjalp ikke, og nu red de stiltiende videre i stor frygt, De betragtede jo dette her som en straf, for det de havde stj&#xE5;let kj&#xE6;ppene. Endelig kom de ind til N&#xF6;rager. Der er en lille b&#xE6;k, som de skulde over, og som de nu rider over den, ser Niels sig tilbage, og da ser han et gloende hjul, der render tilbage fra b&#xE6;kken og ad den vej, de var komne. Dermed var alt forbi, og de kom godt hjem til Tustrup. Niels vilde ikke ind og gik straks i seng i karlekammeret. Men Per vilde ind og have noget at &#xE6;de. Han blev syg og sov ikke den hele nat, men Niels sov godt.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Maren Plovmand from Tustrupmark tells the following story: My brother Niels and another farmhand, who was called Per, were supposed to drive swine out to the beechnuts in L&#xF8;venholms forest in the fall. They were riding and when they had gotten the swine out to their place, they wanted to get some hazel switches to take home to use to make baskets. So they cut a good many switches and bound them together with a thin piece of hazel, lay one across each one of the horses and rode back. They had these shaggy caps on with stiff shades that stuck out and a copper rim on both the hat and the brim. As they are riding along, Niels says: "Your hat is on fire, Per." -- "I don't get that." he says and looks around. "But your beard and hair are also on fire." Then Niels says, "Your whip is on fire too." -- "No matter. I am not letting them go until I have to. Let us say the Lord's Prayer." They did that, but it didn't help, and now they rode silently along, quite afraid. They saw this as a punishment for having stolen the switches. Finally they came to N&#xF6;rager. There is a little stream there that they had to cross, and as they ride over it, Niels looks back and he sees a glowing wheel, spinning away from the stream and along the road they had come on. After that, everything was over, and they got home to Tustrup safe and sound. Niels didn't want to go in to the house and went immediately to bed in the farmhands' room. But Per wanted to go in and get something to eat. He got sick and didn't sleep at all that night, but Niels slept well.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>On my father&#x2019;s field in Skiffard there was a big dale, Dybdal, and on each side there were big hills. To the east is Bj&#xE6;rgbakken (Mountain hill), and when the farmhand plowed near there one day, he found a peel board which he repaired while he ate his sandwich. When he came back, a cake lay there and he ate a little bit of it and he also gave some to the girl who was spreading manure. But she got silly stupid because of it and when she got home, she said: &#x201C;Can you hear how they&#x2019;re playing out in the mound? I&#x2019;ve got to go out to them.&#x201D; She absolutely wanted to leave and the old man now saw that she ran out to the mound. There the mound dwellers tumbled about with her the entire night. She came back well enough the next morning but they had to keep her locked up after that to keep her from going out to the mound.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A man rode out on the heath one night outside of Kj&#xE6;rb&#xF8;lling along with his horses to put them out to graze. When he was on his way home, he saw someone walking in front of him and he thought it was a neighbor so he called out to him; but the other one continued to walk and the man said then: &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t you wait, damn you (literally: for the devil!)&#x201D; Now the other man waited; but when the other man got there, he discovered that it was the devil, who he now had to accompany. The next night he was supposed to go out to him again, but his wife and children wouldn&#x2019;t let him go. Then there was such a row that they thought that the barn had tipped over, so the man had to go out. The next day, he went over to minister Bang in Vilstrup in Skibet parish and asked him to help him get rid of the Evil One&#x2019;s company. Then the minister taught him a verse that he was to read for the Evil One the next time he went out to him. In addition, he told him to carry a plowshare in his hand and when the devil asked him to give him his hand, he was to give him the plowshare instead. The man did this, too, when he went out to him the next night, and the devil grabbed it so hard that he kept a piece of the plowshare in his hand. Ever since then he didn&#x2019;t have to go out to the Evil One at night, but he got sick and wasn&#x2019;t fit for anything ever again.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>In another farm there were also a lot of elves who caused a great deal of commotion. Then one night the man came home and said that now he knew that they&#x2019;d have peace in the farm, he had seen that the elves were moving over to his neighbor&#x2019;s farm. From that day on, they were free of them too. Then there was a woman who couldn&#x2019;t hear at all where they now were. But at night when the others slept she could hear that the elves tumbled about with the beer kegs because they were brewing at the time. Then, when they&#x2019;d lived in that farm for a long time, one night the ferryman rowed back and forth over the sound without stop without knowing what he&#x2019;d been rowing over and without being allowed to go ashore. He could feel that there was something in the boat each time, but he didn&#x2019;t see anything. Finally, when he was at the other side yet again, one came up to him and put another hat on his head, and then he could see an enormous crowd standing on the beach. Not until then did he understand what he&#x2019;d been sailing with. Then one of them came and gave him a full money bag, so the ferryman was from that day on a rich man. Since that night there haven&#x2019;t been any elves on the island.</english_publication>

Then there was a grocer from Hj&#xF8;rring, they called him Niels Gryt, and the cunning man accused his wife of being a witch. That's enough, it goes bad, the grocer gets angry, and the district bailiff and lots of other important people are brought together, and Anders Alleh&#xE5;nde is to be sentenced to lose his right hand and his fingers. Now when they were done with all that, and he was sentenced to this, then a large dog comes to the door with big clear eyes, and scratches at it. "If you won't let the dog in," he says, "then I will." Then he called the grocer's wife by name and when he did that, she was standing there buck naked in there with them, and the grocer took his cloak and threw it over her. Now Anders Alleh&#xE5;nde was saved, because they could see what kind of a wife the grocer had. After that time, Anders couldn't remember anything.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Der var en mand p&#xE5; Harbo&#xF8;re, som plyndrede og ihjelslog &#xE9;n, der var strandet. Inden mennesket d&#xF8;de, skal han have udtalt den forbandelse, at det vilde komme over hans b&#xF6;rn, de vilde komme til at d&#xF8; pludselig ligesom nu han. Den mand havde tre s&#xF6;nner, og de druknede i et stormvejr p&#xE5; havet. Den tredje boede i Vrist og omkom p&#xE5; en s&#xE6;regen m&#xE5;de. Det var i en stormnat, havet gik s&#xE5; h&#xF6;jt, at der var fare for, at b&#xE5;dene, der var trukne meget h&#xF6;jt op p&#xE5; stranden, skulde blive revne v&#xE6;k. Folkene vilde da tr&#xE6;kke dem over de lave klitter og m&#xE5;tte til den ende fylde dem med sand, idet vinden ellers vilde have taget dem, n&#xE5;r de kom helt op. Den mand, her er tale om, hjalp ved den ene b&#xE5;d, men idet den kom op, tog vinden dog s&#xE5;dan i den, at han kom under den og blev knust. Der gik straks bud til hans g&#xE5;rd, og konen kom i m&#xF8;de med dem, der bar ham hjem, omtrent midtvejs. Der var endnu liv i ham, men han d&#xF8;de straks efter.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a man in the Harbo islands, who plundered and killed a person who was stranded. Just before the person died, he uttered a curse that would affect his children, they would die suddenly just like he was dying now. That man had three sons, and they drowned in a storm at sea. The third one lived in Vrist and died in a similar manner. It was a stormy night, the sea was so high that there was a danger that the boats that had been dragged far up on the beach would be torn away. People wanted to pull them over the low cliffs and for that reason had to fill them with sand, because otherwise the wind would have taken them when they got them totally up. The man who we&#x2019;re talking about helped with one of the boats, but before it came up, the wind took it in such a way that he wound up under it and was crushed. A messenger was immediately sent to his farm and his wife came out and met the people who were carrying him home almost halfway. He was still alive but died shortly after.</english_publication>

S&#xE5; en vinter havde de f&#xE5;et tidlig optorsken og havde ikke videre noget at bestille. S&#xF6;nnen i g&#xE5;rden sagde da til karlen: "Kan du g&#xE5; hen og gj&#xF8;re havediget op." Han tog s&#xE5; en spade og gik hen og begyndte at grave t&#xF6;rv neden for diget. I det han nu grov en t&#xF6;rv og lagde op, s&#xE5; v&#xE6;ltede der nogle store skillinger ud af t&#xF6;rven. Han s&#xE5; n&#xF6;jere efter og fandt nogle og tredive. S&#xE5; gik han ind og fortalte enken det. "N&#xE5;", siger hun, "nu er det opdaget. Min mand tabte en gang en l&#xE6;derpung med 60 daler i, og han kunde aldrig finde den. Han ledte i foderloen og i m&#xF8;ngen og i udhusene, for han troede jo, han havde tabt den der &#xE9;t steder." Men siden s&#xE5; karlen aldrig lyset.

    <english_publication>A farmhand worked at a farm in Dronninglund, and he was there for three years. Every time he was out and came home at night, he saw a light out on their garden wall. So one winter, when they'd finished threshing early and didn&#x2019;t have anything to do, the son in the farm said to the farmhand: &#x201C;Can you go out and dig up the garden wall." So he took a shovel and went out there and began to dig peat at the foot of the wall. Just when he dug up a peat divot, some big shillings tumbled out of the peat. He looked a bit closer and found some thirty and something. Then he went in and told the widow that. &#x201C;Ahh,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;now it&#x2019;s been discovered. My husband lost a leather purse with sixty daler in it, and he was never able to find it. He looked in the feed bins, in the compost heap, in the outhouses, since he thought he had lost it in one of those places." But the farmhand never saw the light again. It was odd that they never found any more of the money. They have no idea how the money came to lie out there by the garden wall but the man most likely was out there on a call of nature.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Det kan undertiden h&#xE6;nde i en bondeg&#xE5;rd, at enhver sp&#xE6;dekalv, som s&#xE6;ttes ind i en vis bestemt b&#xF8;vl for sig selv, d&#xF8;er, inden den kan bindes i b&#xE5;s. Det bedste middel derimod er en gang at f&#xE5; &#xE9;n til at for&#xE6;re sig en kalv. Men slige uheld kan ogs&#xE5; skyldes visse &#xE5;rsager og afhj&#xE6;lpes ved at fjerne disse. S&#xE5;ledes s&#xF6;gte en gang en mand til en klog kone og fortalte hende, at alle hans kalve d&#xF8;de, som kom til at st&#xE5; i den og den sti, og han bad hende da om et r&#xE5;d derfor. Ja, det havde sine gode grunde, svarede konen, nu skulde han bare gj&#xF8;re rent i kalvestien, s&#xE5; fandt de nok en tilhuggen s&#xE6;ttesten (kantsten), den skulde tages bort, ti s&#xE5; l&#xE6;nge den var der, kunde ingen kalv leve i stien, men han m&#xE5;tte ikke give tabt, f&#xF6;r han fandt stenen, da det var ganske bestemt, at den fandtes der. Manden tog nu hjem med den besked og gav sig straks til at rydde op i kalvestien, men han gravede og gravede og fandt ingen sten. Endelig langt om l&#xE6;nge, da han var kommen to alen ned i jorden, fandt han ganske rigtig en lang, smal tilhuggen sten. Den blev nu tagen bort, og siden d&#xF8;de aldrig nogen kalv i stien.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Sometimes it happens at farms that a newborn calf that is put in a manger alone dies before it can be put into a stall. The best defense against that is to get someone to give you a calf. But this kind of misfortune can also be due to certain things, and the situation can be improved by getting rid of these things. That's how a man once went and sought help from a cunning woman and he told her that his calves died if they stood in such and such a stall, and he asked her for advice. Yes, there were reasons for that, he should go ahead and clean the calf stall, they would likely find a carved runner stone, they should take that away, because as long as it was there, no calf would be able to live in the stall, but he must not stop until he found the stone, because it was quite certain it was there. The man went home with this message and immediately began cleaning the calf stall, but he dug and dug and didn't find a stone. Finally, after a long while, when he had gotten down four feet, he sure enough found a long, thin, carved stone. That was now taken away and after that not a single calf died in the stall.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Det er ikke s&#xE5; forskr&#xE6;kkelig l&#xE6;nge siden, at der boede en herremand p&#xE5; &#xD6;rndrup, de kaldte Speitzer. Han var s&#xE5; grusselig h&#xE5;rd ved b&#xF8;nderne, at det n&#xE6;sten ikke var til at holde ud. S&#xE5; var der da ogs&#xE5; nogle af hans folk, der blev enige om at undlive ham eller i det mindste sl&#xE5; ham ford&#xE6;rvet, og en dag stimlede de sammen om ham ude i marken, og to karle sprang p&#xE5; ham. De fik det ligevel ikke gjort af med ham, men hans h&#xE6;nder fik han nok rent smadrede. Gjerningsm&#xE6;ndene r&#xF6;mmede s&#xE5; til Hamborg &#x2014; den ene kom for resten siden tilbage igjen.
     Den samme Speitzer ejede ogs&#xE5; V&#xE5;r og Aggersborgg&#xE5;rd. Han blev ved at v&#xE6;re lige h&#xE5;rd ved b&#xF8;nderne, og en gang tugtede han nogle folk s&#xE5; helt forf&#xE6;rdelig. Men s&#xE5; et st&#xF8;d efter s&#xE5; folkene p&#xE5; V&#xE5;r en dag, at der gik en fremmed mand og fulgtes med Speitzer i g&#xE5;rden. Den fremmede s&#xE5; noget s&#xE6;r ud, men det t&#xE6;nkte folkene nu ikke videre ved, de hattede jo og hilste, som det h&#xF8;rte til. Speitzer og denher fremmede mand g&#xE5;r nu og snakker sammen, men ingen kunde blive klog p&#xE5;, hvad det var om. Folkene h&#xF8;rte blot, at Speitzer til sidst sagde: "Det t&#xE6;nkte jeg &#x2014; s&#xE5; bandte han &#x2014; nok." I det samme gik han og den fremmede op ad en h&#xF6;j stentrappe, og vilde da som til at ind i slottet. Men lige idet de kom til det &#xF8;verste trin, h&#xF8;rer folkene et skrig og ser, Speitzer stejler bagl&#xE6;nds ned, og s&#xE5; var han ene &#x2014; den fremmede var v&#xE6;k som et stj&#xE6;rneskud. Der l&#xE5; nu Speitzer og var d&#xF8;d, men om han blev helt henne den gang, skal jeg ligevel ikke sige til sikkerhed; jeg tror det nok. Men efter hans d&#xF8;d blev han ellers ved at f&#xE6;rdes rundt omkring i egnen, is&#xE6;r imellem V&#xE5;r og Aggersborgg&#xE5;rd. Han skulde jo s&#xE5; over fjorden, og fiskerne, som l&#xE5; der ude sommer og efter&#xE5;r og fiskede om natten, b&#xE5;de h&#xF8;rte og s&#xE5; ham ikke &#xE9;n men mange gange. Han s&#xE5; ud som en grim, stor, sort fugl, og s&#xE5; r&#xE5;bte og skreg han, te det var nok skr&#xE6;kkeligt at h&#xF8;re, men "skarnen" var vel ogs&#xE5; efter ham. En gang var der et par unge fiskere, der talte ham noget slemt til en nat, de h&#xF8;rte ham; men s&#xE5; havde de ham strags, og dette her skidteri tumlede nok s&#xE5;dan med b&#xE5;den, at fiskerne n&#xE6;r havde g&#xE5;et neden om og hjem.
     Der er jo, som vi v&#xE9;d nok, en grumme hoben eng langs med s&#xF8;ndre side af fjorden, fra Aggersund og helt til Nibe. Alle de enge vilde Speitzer gj&#xE6;rne have fingre i, og han skrev til kongen, at dersom han m&#xE5;tte f&#xE5; dem, vilde han bel&#xE6;gge dem med st&#xE5;l og lade sine svende dandse hen over dem. Kongen studerer jo noget p&#xE5; den her skrivelse, og han vilde ogs&#xE5; nok lade Speitzer f&#xE5; engene. Men s&#xE5; havde kongen en nar, som de jo plejede i gammel tid; han skulde nu ogs&#xE5; have sin snak med om dette her, og han var ikke s&#xE5; gal som kongen. Han sagde, at st&#xE5;let, engene skulde bel&#xE6;gges med, var h&#xF8;leer, og svendene, der skulde dandse over dem, var Speitzers hovfolk, og da kongen fik den forklaring, vilde han ikke lade Speitzer f&#xE5; engene.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>It isn&#x2019;t terribly long ago that there was a manor lord who lived at &#xD6;rndrup whom they called Speitzer. He was so terribly hard on his peasants, that they could barely stand it. So there was a group of his people who agreed to kill him or, at the very least, beat him badly, and one day they surrounded him out in the field and two farmhands jumped on him. They didn&#x2019;t manage to kill him, but he did get his hands smashed badly. The perpetrators fled to Hamburg&#x2014;one of them later came back again. 
     The same Speitzer owned V&#xE5;r and Aggersborgg&#xE5;rd. He continued to be just as hard on his peasants, and one day he punished some people quite terribly. But a little later, the people at V&#xE5;r saw one day that there was a stranger following along with Speitzer at the farm. The stranger looked kind of odd, but the people didn&#x2019;t pay him much mind, they doffed their hats and greeted him, as one did. Speitzer and this stranger now go and talk together, but no one could figure out what it was all about. The people only heard that Speitzer finally said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s what I &#x2013; then he swore &#x2013; thought.&#x201D; At the same time, he and the stranger were climbing a steep stone staircase, and made as if they were going to go into the castle. But just as they get to the top stair, they hear a scream and they see Speitzer fall backwards down the stairs, and then he was alone &#x2013; the stranger had disappeared like a shooting star. Now Speitzer lay there and was dead, but if he was completely gone then I can&#x2019;t say for sure; I think so. After his death he continued to wander around the district, especially between V&#xE5;r and Aggersborgg&#xE5;rd. He wanted to cross the fjord, and the fishermen who were out there during the summer and fall and fished at night, both heard and saw him not once but many times. He looked like a big, black, ugly bird, and he shouted and yelled, and it was terrifying to hear, but the &#x201C;beast&#x201D; was after him. One time there were a couple of young fishermen who talked badly about him one night; but then he was there immediately, and this devilry tumbled the boat so hard that the fishermen nearly went down and home. 
     There were, as we know, a  whole group of meadows down along the southern side of the fjord, from Aggersund and all the way to Nibe. Speitzer wanted his fingers in all those meadows, and he wrote to the king that, if he were allowed to have them, he would cover them with steel and let his lads dance over them. The King studies this letter a bit and he was about to let Speitzer have the meadows. But the king had a fool as was the custom in the old days; he was also to have a word about this, and he wasn&#x2019;t as crazy as the king. He said that the steel that the meadows were to be covered with were hay scythes, and the lads who were going to dance over them were Speitzer&#x2019;s villeinage peasants, and when the king got that explanation, he wouldn&#x2019;t let Speitzer have the meadows.</english_publication>

I gamle dage skal der have v&#xE6;ret en stor lindorm i denne mose, og den beskrives som et frygteligt uhyre. Af st&#xF6;rrelse var den som et l&#xE6;ssetr&#xE6; eller bindestang, og ingen turde komme i n&#xE6;rheden af dens opholdssted. En mand, som en gang kom mosen for n&#xE6;r, blev forfulgt af den frygtelige orm lige til Ryslinge, som ligger en fjerdingvej derfra. Her kr&#xF8;b manden i sin n&#xF8;d op i kirket&#xE5;rnet, og der kunde lindormen ikke f&#xF8;lge efter ham. Den fors&#xF6;gte vel at sl&#xE5; kirken omkuld med sin hale, men det kunde den heller ikke. Manden, der med stor skr&#xE6;k havde set, at lindormen slog til kirken, og at den med sin hale rakte n&#xE6;sten op til lydhullerne, slap da derfra med livet. Til sidst skal en skytte fra Ravnholt dog have skudt lindormen og derved befriet egnen fra den.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Lindkj&#xE6;r is the name of a large peat swamp that belongs to the Ravnholt estate. In the old days there was supposed to have been a lindorm in that swamp, and it is described as a horrible monster. It was as big as a log used to hold down a hayload, or a roof timber, and no one dared go near where it lived. A man who once got too close to the swamp was chased by the serpent all the way to Ryslinge, several kilometers away. There, out of need, the man crawled up into the church tower and the lindorm couldn't follow him up there. It tried to knock the church over with its tail, but it couldn't do that either. The man who'd fearfully seen the serpent lashing at the church and seen the tail reach nearly to the sound holes, got away with his life. Finally, a sharpshooter from Ravnholt shot the serpent and freed the district from it.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En gang, da jeg kjorte fra Kalundborg, var jeg da n&#xE6;sten kommen til broen ved &#xC5;gerup m&#xF8;lle, og det var s&#xE5; m&#xF8;rkt som en b&#xE6;lg. S&#xE5; s&#xE5; jeg nede ved broen, at der var noget, som gnistrede. "Det var ogs&#xE5; godt" t&#xE6;nkte jeg, "nu kan du f&#xE5; t&#xE6;ndt din pibe". Jeg troede begribeligvis, at det var et menneske, der r&#xF8;g tobak. S&#xE5; gav jeg da pillekerne et rap og n&#xE5;ede snart broen. Ja, det var rigtig nok nogen, der r&#xF8;g tobak, men mennesker var det ikke. Det var bare sm&#xE5; puslinger med m&#xF8;rke tr&#xF6;jer og hvide bukser, og hver af dem havde en s&#xF8;lvpibe (pibe med s&#xF8;lvbeslag). De bakkede godt, og n&#xE5;r ilden gnistrede, s&#xE5; kunde jeg s&#xE5; rivelig se dem. De gik p&#xE5; kanten af vejen, &#xE9;n for &#xE9;n, og de skulde formodentlig til gilde i en h&#xF6;j der omkring. Jeg sagde god-aften, men de svarede ikke, og jeg turde nok ikke vove at bede om ild p&#xE5; min pibe, b&#xE6;sterne de fnyste og skabede sig, og jeg lod dem jo l&#xF8;be, s&#xE5; det varede ikke ret l&#xE6;nge, inden jeg kom fra dj&#xE6;velskabet. Men det kan nok h&#xE6;nde sig, at jeg var ikke rigtig glad, f&#xF6;rend jeg kom hjem til vor mo'r.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Once when I was driving from Kalundborg, I'd almost gotten to bridge at &#xC5;gerup mill, and it was dark as pitch. Then I noticed that something was sparkling down by the bridge. "That's good," I thought, "now I can get my pipe lit." I thought that maybe it was some people smoking. So I gave the horses a whack and soon reached the bridge. Well, it was  someone smoking, sure enough, but it wasn't people. They were small little ones with dark sweaters and white pants, and each one of them had a silver plated pipe. They were puffing away and when the fire sparked I could see them well. They were walking along the side of the road, one behind the other, and they were presumably going to a party in a mound near there. I said good evening, but they didn't answer, and I didn't dare ask them for a light for my pipe, the horses were snorting and restless, and I let them run, so it didn't take long before I got away from that devilishness. But I wasn't really happy until I got home to mom.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Det traf sig en gang, at en vejfarende karl kom ind i en bondeg&#xE5;rd i n&#xE6;rheden af Kolding. Da det var imod aften, bad han om nattely, som han ogs&#xE5; fik. Imidlertid havde bonden en kj&#xF6;n datter, som karlen fik lyst til, og han fik da gjort s&#xE5;dan aftale med hende, at han besov hende den samme nat. Da nu ulykken var sket, begyndte pigen at jamre og klage sig, som hun nok ogs&#xE5; kunde have &#xE5;rsag til, men karlen tr&#xF8;stede hende og sagde: "&#xC5;, du skal ikke tage dig det s&#xE5; n&#xE6;r, jeg rejser rigtig nok, n&#xE5;r vi har f&#xE5;et davre, men dersom du bliver med barn, s&#xE5; kan du bare g&#xE5; op p&#xE5; Koldinghus og sp&#xF6;rge efter Hans med den lange n&#xE6;se, for der er jeg for det meste". N&#xE5;, karlen han tog jo afsked med hende og gik sin vej. En tre fjerding&#xE5;r efter f&#xF8;dte pigen en stor dreng, og det var jo s&#xF6;rgeligt, mente for&#xE6;ldrene, da de ikke kjendte nogen fader til ham, men datteren var tr&#xF8;stig og mente, at hun nok skulde finde ham. Da hun s&#xE5; var bleven rask, og drengen var bleven d&#xF6;bt, stod hun en dag tidlig op, tog sin dreng i forkl&#xE6;det og gik til Koldinghus. Da hun kom til porten og s&#xE5; skildvagterne, havde hun jo n&#xE6;r mistet sit liv af skr&#xE6;k, men da hun sagde, hvem hun skulde til, grinede de s&#xE5; sm&#xF6;rret ad hende og lod hende passere. Nu gik hun da ind i borgg&#xE5;rden, og der var jo s&#xE5; mange fine folk, s&#xE5; hun ikke vidste, hvem hun skulde vende sig til. Endelig kom der en pudsig lille fyr hen til hende og vilde se, hvad hun havde i sit forkl&#xE6;de. "Ej, ej", sagde han leende, "hvem skal have den kn&#xE6;gt?" &#x2014; "Det skal Hans med den lange n&#xE6;se". &#x2014; "N&#xE5;, har han nu v&#xE6;ret der igjen, ja, drengen ligner ham godt nok. F&#xF8;lg nu med mig, min pige, s&#xE5; skal vi nok finde ham". De fulgtes nu ad ind i en stor sal. Her spurgte den lille mand en skildvagt, om kongen var i sin stue. Nu begyndte pigen at blive hed om &#xF8;rene, men inden hun vidste af det, stod hun i en pr&#xE6;gtig stue ud for en mand, som hun straks t&#xE6;nkte m&#xE5;tte v&#xE6;re kongen. "Nu, Hans", sagde hofnarren, som havde vist pigen vej, "her kommer en af dine mange kj&#xE6;rester, og hun har et helt forkl&#xE6;de fuldt af drenge med lange n&#xE6;ser". Da pigen havde fattet sig lidt, s&#xE5; hun, at kongen var den samme vejfarende karl, som havde ligget natten over hos dem. Da nu kongen havde set rigtig b&#xE5;de p&#xE5; pigen og drengen, var han villig til at tage sig skylden p&#xE5;. Han for&#xE6;rede hende da en bondeg&#xE5;rd til arv og eje, som l&#xE5; i n&#xE6;rheden af hendes hjem. Siden efter blev hun gift, og efter sigelsen ejes g&#xE5;rden endnu af hendes efterkommere.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>It happened once that a farmhand who was traveling along a road came into a farm somewhere near Kolding. It was on toward nightfall, so he asked for lodgings and he got them. In the meantime, the farmer had a pretty daughter, whom the farmhand decided he wanted, and he made an agreement with her, so he got to sleep with her that night. Once the thing had happened, the girl began to complain, which she had a reason to, but the farmhand comforted her and said, "Oh, don't take it so hard, sure I'm going to leave after breakfast, but if you get pregnant, you can always go up to Koldinghus fort and ask for Hans with the long nose, that's where I usually am." Well, the farmhand said goodbye and went on his way. Three quarters of a year later, the girl gave birth to a big boy, and the parents felt that it was sad that they didn't know anything about the father, but the daughter was cheerful and felt that she'd be able to find him. When she'd gotten better, and the boy had been baptized, she got up early one morning, took her boy in her apron, and went to Koldinghus fort. When she got to the gate and saw the guards, she almost died of fright, but when she told them who she wanted to see, they smiled buttery smiles and let her pass.  She went into the courtyard of the fort and there were so many fine people, that she didn't know who to turn to. Finally, a funny little fellow came up to her and wanted to see what she had in her apron. "Ah, ah," he said, laughing, "who is to have that lad?" -- "Hans with the long nose."-- "Oh, has he been there again? The boy sure looks like him. Come with me my girl, we'll find him." She followed him into a large room. The little man asked a guard there if the king was in his room. Now the girl started to get hot around the ears, but before she knew it, she was in a magnificent room in front of a man she immediately figured was the king. "Now Hans," said the court fool, who'd shown the girl the way, "here comes one of your many lovers, and she has a whole apron full of boys with long noses." When the girl had composed herself a bit, she saw that the king was the same man who had slept at their place. When the king had gotten a good look at the girl and the boy, he was willing to take responsibility for them. He gave her a farm to own and to pass down that was right near her home. Later, she got married and according to what is said, the farm is still owned by her descendants.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Skj&#xF6;rping sogn inde i Buderupholms skov er en plads, der kaldes Skj&#xF6;rping holme og er omgivet af volde og grave. Her skal der i dronning Margretes tid have v&#xE6;ret en r&#xF8;verbande, der drev sit uv&#xE6;sen fra en velbef&#xE6;stet borg. Om s&#xF8;ndagen s&#xF6;gte de til en af de omliggende kirker, hvor de lod, som om de var meget gudfrygtige; men p&#xE5; hjemvejen r&#xF8;vede og plyndrede de vidt og bredt. Ingen kunde s&#xE6;tte sig til modv&#xE6;rge, ti r&#xF8;verne var for mandst&#xE6;rke over for de d&#xE5;rligt bev&#xE6;bnede b&#xF8;nder.

For at disse nu ikke skulde ane ur&#xE5;d, lod Margrete skoene p&#xE5; sine f&#xF8;lgesvendes heste vende om, s&#xE5;ledes at hagerne kom til at vende frem ad, og p&#xE5; denne m&#xE5;de red de ind i r&#xF8;verborgen. R&#xF8;verne kunde ved deres hjemkomst ikke se andet end spor af udadg&#xE5;ende heste, og da de troede, at det var af deres egne, red de ubekymrede ind i g&#xE5;rden. Men her blev de modtagne s&#xE5; varmt af dronningens ryttere, at de ikke kom til at gj&#xF8;re flere udflugter; og medens dette stod p&#xE5;, sad dronning Margrete p&#xE5; en h&#xF6;j udenfor borgen, hvorfra hun kunde overse det hele. Borgen blev &#xF8;delagt, men tomten og voldresterne p&#xE5;vises endnu, s&#xE5;vel som den h&#xF6;j, hvorfra dronningen overs&#xE5; tildragelsen, og som siden den tid b&#xE6;rer navnet Dronningens h&#xF6;j. </danish_publication>
    <english_publication>In Sk&#xF8;rping parish, in Buderupholm forest, there's a place called Sk&#xF8;rping holme, and it is surrounded by moats and walls. During Queen Margrete's time, there was supposed to have been a robber band that worked out of a well-fortified fort. On Sunday, they would go to one of the nearby churches where they pretended to be very pious; but on the way home they would rob and plunder widely. No one could take them on since they were too strong for the poorly armed peasants. In their need, the local peasantry sent a call for help to Queen Margrete. She came with a well-armed group one Sunday when the robbers were at church. So they wouldn't realize something was up, she had her troops put their horseshoes on backwards so that the heel faced forward, and they rode into the robbers' fort that way. When they got back, the robbers couldn't see anything other than horse tracks going out of the fort, so they thought they were their own, and they rode into the fort without worry. But here they got such a warm reception from the Queen's knights that they never went on any more expeditions; and while this was going on, Margrete sat on a mound outside of the fort where she could observe everything. The fort was destroyed, but the field and the ruins of the walls can still be seen, as well as the mound where the Queen watched the events, and to this day it still carries the name the Queen's Mound.</english_publication>

First, he got all of the witch fat together, and after he had closed and stopped up all the doors and windows, he threw the fat on the fire, but if the witch managed to see the flames, then all his efforts would have been wasted. While this was going on in the house, the same witch was out in the swamp gathering hay. All of a sudden, she began screaming and running as fast as she could; but because she couldn't see the flames, her face got terribly burned.</english_publication>

Jeg skubbede til farbroder og sagde sagte: "Hvad er det?" Han sagde: "Ti stille, den skikkelse ser jeg hver aften, jeg g&#xE5;r her, men s&#xE5;dan noget gj&#xF6;r ikke noget, n&#xE5;r vi passer os selv."

    <english_publication>A woman in Holev in Fyn tells the following story: &#x201C;When I was a child, I was driving one time at dusk with my father&#x2019;s brother on the road between Rynkeby and Revninge. Just as we&#x2019;re driving along, the horses stopped dead in their tracks and wouldn&#x2019;t take another step; my uncle whipped them but that didn&#x2019;t help, we didn&#x2019;t move, we stopped there for about half an hour. Then uncle jumped quickly off the wagon, went around to the horses and made a spark, then he got back up into the wagon and then the horse could go and ever since then nothing has ever gone wrong whenever we drive past that place. One night, me and uncle came walking along the same road and when we came to the place where the horses had stopped, I saw that there was a tall shape without a head in a grayish white cape right in front of us on the road. I nudged uncle and said to him quietly: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D; He said: &#x201C;Be quiet, I see that shape every night I walk here, but that kind of thing doesn&#x2019;t do anything when we mind our own business.&#x201D; It was that shape that had met the horses so they couldn&#x2019;t go forward but we couldn&#x2019;t see it so early at night.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>In Bedsted there's Tofth&#xF8;j, and the owner started digging in it. Then he lost a nag and the next day a cow and then a short while later another cow. Then he came to think that maybe it was the mound's fault. He went up to dean Bentzon here and told him about it and asked him if he thought that it was punishment for that. He answered that since he thought that himself he should leave the mound alone, but if he didn't think that, then he wouldn't say anything. He went home and covered up the hole. Then the bad luck stopped. He instructed his son to preserve the mound and he did the same later for his son-in-law. Now it has been given to the state.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>A person who was mute came into a grocer's house who was lying on his deathbed, it was just at the moment that the spirit was going to leave him. Then the mute begins to howl and complain and make noises and shout. A little later, he goes into a market town, and at the same moment a soldier comes riding by quickly. Then his horse trips and he broke his neck. When the mute saw that, he claps his hands and is so happy and pleased that it is alarming. When people saw how he was enjoying himself, they wanted to know why. Then a prayer was said at the pulpit asking the Lord to open the mute's mouth so he could talk. The prayer was answered and then he said, "When I got to the grocer, the devil was sitting at the head of his bed and took his soul, because he had cheated people in all sorts of ways with his weights and measures. But the soldier, when he fell from his horse and slammed into the ground, he gave a deep sigh to our Lord, and then an angel came from heaven and took his soul and went off to heaven with it."</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Ovre i Jylland boede en mand, som kunde uddrive rotter og mus, og da Samsingerne var meget plagede af s&#xE5;danne, blev der sendt bud over til ham, om han ikke vilde komme for at &#xF8;ve sin kunst. Det vilde han nok, men for at sikre sig mod en lindorm, hvis en s&#xE5;dan skulde findes herovre, forlangte han, at de skulde t&#xE6;nde og vedligeholde et stort b&#xE5;l, samt holde en kraftig hest opsadlet. Manden begyndte nu sin idr&#xE6;t; men s&#xE5; kom der en lindorm ovre fra Lindholm hen imod ham. Han steg da til hest, og da lindormen var t&#xE6;t ved ham, red han igjennem ilden. S&#xE5; snart ormen s&#xE5; dette, satte den bag efter. Det gjentog sig s&#xE5; tit, at ormen til sidst forbr&#xE6;ndte sig og d&#xF8;de deraf. &#xC5;ret efter efter kom manden herover igjen, og han vilde da hen at se stedet, hvor han havde f&#xE6;ldet lindormen; men i det han gik og sparkede til levningerne af den, fik han et ben i foden, og deraf d&#xF8;de han.

Sure enough he&#x2019;d do that, but to protect himself against a lindorm, if one was to be found over there, he requested that a big bonfire be lit and kept burning as well as a strong horse be kept saddled and ready. The man now began his sport; but then a lindorm came at him from over in Lindholm. He got up on the horse and when the lindorm was close to him he rode right through the fire. As soon as the lindorm saw that, it followed in quick pursuit. He repeated this so many times that finally the lindorm got burned and died from that. The next year the man came over here again and he wanted to go and see the place where he&#x2019;d defeated the lindorm; but while he went and kicked at the pieces of it, he got a bone splinter in his foot, and died from that. 
     There is an old saying that the person who kills a lindorm may not come back to the place where the killing took place because that will cost him his life.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Et steds p&#xE5; Salling i n&#xE6;rheden af et markskjel havde de vejfarende ofte h&#xF8;rt &#xE9;n r&#xE5;be: "Hvor m&#xE5; jeg s&#xE6;tte den?" men ingen turde svare ham. En aften, da en lille dreng fulgtes med sin fader over marken der i n&#xE6;rheden, og de ogs&#xE5; fik r&#xF8;sten at h&#xF8;re, bad drengen om faderens minde til at m&#xE5;tte svare, n&#xE5;r der atter blev r&#xE5;bt. Faderen skyndte sig at i rette s&#xE6;tte drengen ved at love ham en ordentlig dragt prygl, hvis han indlod sig p&#xE5; sligt, "ti", lagde han til, "ingen kan vide, om du ikke nok, hvis du svarer, kan f&#xE5; mere med den gamle gjenganger at bestille, end du sk&#xF8;tter om." Lidt efter h&#xF8;rte de atter: "Hvor m&#xE5; jeg s&#xE6;tte den?" og uden at bet&#xE6;nke sig svarede drengen: "S&#xE6;t den, hvor du st&#xE5;r!" &#x2014; "Tak," blev der svaret, og siden h&#xF8;rte man aldrig til noget. Folk der p&#xE5; egnen mente, at den, der havde r&#xE5;bt, m&#xE5;tte i levende live have flyttet et markskjel, hvorfor han ikke kunde finde ro i sin grav, f&#xF6;rend den sag var bragt i rigtighed.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>In a place in Salling near a field marker, travelers along the road had often heard someone cry out: &#x201C;Where can I set it down?&#x201D; but nobody dared answer him. One night, a little boy, who was accompanying his father over to the field near there, also heard the voice, and the boy asked the father permission to answer if they heard the cry again. The father hurried to correct the boy by promising him a severe beating if he tried doing something like that, &#x201C;since&#x201D; he added &#x201C;no one can know, if you answer, whether or not you&#x2019;ll end up having more to do with the revenant than you&#x2019;d want to.&#x201D; A little later they heard the cry, &#x201C;Where can I set it down?&#x201D; and without thinking the boy said: &#x201C;Set it down where you&#x2019;re standing!&#x201D; &#x201C;Thanks,&#x201D; came the answer and, after that, it was never heard again. The people in the area thought that the one who had cried out had probably moved a marker when he was alive, and that&#x2019;s why he couldn&#x2019;t get peace in the grave until that matter was righted.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>N&#xE5;r en kvinde f&#xF8;rste gang er frugtsommelig og g&#xE5;r i angst for f&#xF6;dselssm&#xE6;rterne, kan hun slippe for dem, n&#xE5;r hun selv vil. Hun skal da f&#xF6;r dag g&#xE5; hen, hvor der ligger en horserad (hestebenrad) eller en horseham (hammen, som omslutter f&#xF8;llet f&#xF6;r f&#xF8;dslen) og stille den op. N&#xE5;r hun s&#xE5; kryber n&#xF8;gen der igjennem tre gange i Dj&#xE6;velens navn, f&#xE5;r hun aldrig nogen sinde f&#xF8;dselsveer at m&#xE6;rke; men der knytter sig til hendes f&#xF8;rstef&#xF8;dte den forbandelse, at barnet bliver halvvejs dyr; er det en dreng, bliver han en varulv, men er det en pige, bliver hun en mare. S&#xE5;danne sm&#xE5; stakler ser ud som andre b&#xF6;rn p&#xE5; det n&#xE6;r, at &#xF6;jenbrynene g&#xE5;r helt sammen over n&#xE6;sen. Men de er tillige f&#xF8;dt med en l&#xE5;dden "dot" (lidt oph&#xF8;jet plet) mellem skuldrene; den s&#xF8;ger moderen meget omhyggelig at skjule, medens barnet er lille, men n&#xE5;r det bliver st&#xF8;rre, meddeler hun det, hvad dotten har at betyde, og s&#xE5; skal barnet nok b&#xE5;de da og siden vogte sig for at blotte sig i andres n&#xE6;rv&#xE6;relse. N&#xE5;r barnet bliver fuldvoksent, kommer dets forbandelse, dyrenaturen frem; s&#xE5; snart m&#xF8;rket er faldet p&#xE5;, fj&#xE6;rner den ulykkelige sig fra andre mennesker, hvorp&#xE5; dotten mellem skuldrene udvider sig, s&#xE5; hele legemet bliver l&#xE5;ddent og med det samme f&#xE5;r dyreskikkelse. S&#xE5; st&#xE5;r der en varulv eller mare, eftersom det er en mand eller kvinde, der er forvandlet. Varulven farer ud for at se, om han kan tr&#xE6;ffe en kvinde, der er frugtsommelig; kan han det og kan komme af sted med at rive fosteret levende ud af moderens liv og dr&#xE6;be det, s&#xE5; er hans forbandelse h&#xE6;vet med det samme, s&#xE5; han for fremtiden er som andre mennesker. N&#xE5;r en varulv farer ud, humper den af sted p&#xE5; tre ben, medens det fjerde stikker bag ud som en hale. Hunde er al tid slemme ved en s&#xE5;dan stakkel og farer hylende og halsende efter den, og da den kun kan humpe p&#xE5; tre ben, har hundene let ved at indhente den; den m&#xE5; da s&#xF8;ge tilflugt mellem t&#xE6;tte buske og tj&#xF6;rne, hvor hundene ikke vover sig ind efter den. Man kan al tid se p&#xE5; et varulvmenneske, n&#xE5;r hundene har v&#xE6;ret efter ham, ti s&#xE5; er han s&#xE5; f&#xE6;lt forreven i ansigtet. Et varulvmenneske kan ogs&#xE5; blive forl&#xF8;st fra sin ulyksalige tilstand, n&#xE5;r &#xE9;n, medens han er i sin naturlige skikkelse, kommer til at sige til ham, at han er en varulv.
En mares skikkelse v&#xE9;d man ikke s&#xE5; meget om, kun at den er som et lille l&#xE5;ddent dyr. Maren s&#xF8;ger mest at komme ind, hvor m&#xE6;nd sover, dog kan den ogs&#xE5; godt f&#xE5; i sinde at "ride" kvinder. Den kan kun komme igjennem n&#xF8;glehullet eller et hul, som er boret i d&#xF6;ren, loftet, vinduet eller andet tr&#xE6;v&#xE6;rk, derfor m&#xE5; man v&#xE6;re s&#xE5; forsigtig at tilstoppe alle slige huller, hvis man vil undg&#xE5; mareridt. Man kan ogs&#xE5; v&#xE6;rge sig ved at stille sine tr&#xE6;sko foran sengen med h&#xE6;lene ind mod den, ti maren kan ikke komme op, uden at den kan tr&#xE6;de ret i dem f&#xF8;rst. Ridningen best&#xE5;r i en meget sm&#xE6;rtefuld trykken for brystet og helt op i halsen, det er ligefrem, som om man skal kv&#xE6;les. Denne fornemmelse fremkommer ved, at maren l&#xE6;gger sig oven p&#xE5; sengedynen lige over ens hj&#xE6;rtekule, og skj&#xF6;nt maren kun er lille, har den en um&#xE5;delig v&#xE6;gt, n&#xE5;r den s&#xE5;dan l&#xE6;gger sig p&#xE5; &#xE9;n. Den, som frygter mareridt, skal anbringe et rundt h&#xE5;ndsold s&#xE5;ledes, at han kan lade det falde over maren og fange den, men han skal anbringe snoren, eller hvad han nu bruger, s&#xE5;ledes, at han, s&#xE5; s&#xE5;re maren er ved at l&#xE6;gge sig, kan lade soldet falde blot ved at gj&#xF8;re en lille bev&#xE6;gelse, ti har den f&#xF8;rst lagt sig, s&#xE5; er det umuligt for ham at r&#xF8;re s&#xE5; meget som en finger; det eneste, man under ridningen kan bev&#xE6;ge, er &#xF6;jnene. Lige med et, f&#xF6;r man v&#xE9;d af det, er maren borte, man m&#xE6;rker ikke, den kommer ind, og heller ikke, at den forlader &#xE9;ns sovekammer. Kan man p&#xE5; den n&#xE6;vnte m&#xE5;de slippe til at fange en mare, er den frelst fra forbandelsen, ti den har ikke magt til at kaste soldet til side, f&#xF6;r den f&#xE5;r talt alle hullerne i soldets bund; men det kan den ikke komme af sted med. N&#xE5;r s&#xE5; dagskj&#xE6;ret falder ind p&#xE5; den, er den forvandlet til menneske med det samme, og den bliver aldrig mare mere. Der er sikkert ikke f&#xE5; frugtsommelige kvinder, der tror p&#xE5; varulves tilv&#xE6;relse, og af den grund ikke t&#xF6;r vove sig uden for en d&#xF6;r, n&#xE5;r m&#xF8;rket falder p&#xE5;. </danish_publication>
    <english_publication>When a woman is pregnant for the first time and is afraid of the birthing pains, she can escape them whenever she wants. Before the day, she should go where there's a horse skeleton or a horse placenta and set it up. If she crawls through there three times in the name of the devil, she will never feel any labor pains; but there is a curse that attaches to her first born, the child will be half animal; if it is a boy, he will become a werewolf, but if it is a girl, she will become a mare. These poor little ones look like other children except that their eyebrows grow together over their nose. But they are also born with a hairy spot between their shoulders; and the mother tries to hide it quite conscientiously while the child is young, but when it gets bigger, then she tells it what the spot means and then the child has to be careful not to get undressed in front of others. When the child is fully grown, the curse of the animal comes out; as soon as it gets dark, the unlucky one goes away from other people, and the spot grows bigger until the whole body is covered with hair and it takes on the animal shape. Then there's a werewolf or a mare there, depending on whether it is a man or a woman who is cursed. The werewolf goes out to see if he can find a pregnant woman; if he can and if he can tear the fetus alive from the woman and kill it, then his curse is lifted and he is like other people from then on. When a werewolf goes out, it limps about on three legs, while the fourth sticks out back like a tail. Dogs are always mean to a poor person like that, and always chase him, barking and howling, and since it can only limp on three legs, the dogs have an easy time catching it; it has to try to escape through thick bushes and thorns, where the dogs don't dare go after it. You can always see on a werewolf person when the dogs have been after him, since he has all sorts of scratches on his face. A werewolf can also be released from his unfortunate circumstances if someone, while he is in his normal shape, says to him that he is a werewolf. One doesn't know that much about the shape of the mare, except that it is a little furry creature. The mare most often tries to get in where men are sleeping, but it can also decide to "ride" women. It can only come in through the keyhole or through a hole drilled in the door, the ceiling, the window or some other wood, and so one has to be careful to plug all holes like that if one wants to avoid being ridden by the mare (nightmares). One can also protect against the mare by placing one's clogs with the heels in, because the mare cannot come up into a bed unless it can step properly into the clogs first. The riding consists of a very painful pressure on the chest all the way up to the throat, it is just like one is going to be strangled. This feeling comes from the mare sitting on top of the blanket right over one's heart, and even though the mare is little, it is incredibly heavy when it lies on one like that. If one is afraid of the mare, one should get a round hand sieve (s&#xE5;ld) and set it up so that it can fall down over the mare and catch it, but one needs to use a rope or whatever one wants to use, so that as soon as the mare lies down, that the sieve can fall just by making a small movement, since once it has lain down, then it is impossible to move even a finger; the only thing one can move during the riding is one's eyes. All of a sudden, before one realizes it, the mare is gone, one doesn't notice it come in, nor that it leaves one's bedroom. If one can get catch a mare in the manner mentioned, the mare is released from its curse, because it does not have the strength to throw the sieve aside until it has counted all the holes in the bottom of it; but it cannot do that. When the first rays of the day hit it, it turns into a person immediately, and then it will never be a mare again. It probably is not just a few pregnant women who believe in werewolves and, because of that, do not dare go outside when it gets dark.</english_publication>

While they stood there, they discovered a headless horse; one of the bravest sat up on the horse and more followed his example... The horse grew so long that its front part reached the opposite bank, while the back side stood dry on the other side. While they were now waiting like that, one exclaimed: &#x201C;Jesus Christ, now I&#x2019;ve never seen so long a horse!&#x201D; As soon as that was said, the horse broke in the middle and the farmhands and girls were dumped into the water.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>S&#xF8;nden for S&#xF8;nderstrupg&#xE5;rd i Han herred har der v&#xE6;ret en h&#xF6;j, som blev sl&#xF6;jfet for en 40, 50 &#xE5;r siden, og der blev bygget en vejrm&#xF8;lle p&#xE5; pladsen. I h&#xF6;jen var en stenstue, hvori der siges at have v&#xE6;ret enkelte sm&#xE5;ting, som ikke blev bevarede. Stenene af stuen brugtes til underbygningen under m&#xF8;llen. Et gammelt sagn fort&#xE6;ller, at der i h&#xF6;jen boede en dv&#xE6;rgkonge, som blev meget vred over den forstyrrelse, der blev i hans hjem, og svor, at han vilde h&#xE6;vne sig derfor. Det gik ud over hestebes&#xE6;tningen. Hestene kunde undertiden blive helt rasende i stalden om natten, og dyrl&#xE6;gen kunde ikke sige, hvad de fejlede. P&#xE5; den tid var der i Vendsyssel en gammel theologisk kandidat, som gik under navn af Hals pr&#xE6;st, han rejste omkring og skaffede fred, hvor der var blevet noget i vejen af den art. I S&#xF8;nderstrupg&#xE5;rd fik de ogs&#xE5; fat p&#xE5; ham. Da han kom, var der flere heste d&#xF8;de, og de andre hang i b&#xE5;sene, da de ikke kunde st&#xE5;. Han sagde, at det var dv&#xE6;rgkongen, der satte hans heste i stalden, og derfor blev de andre heste syge, "men nu skal vi se at f&#xE5; dem bort." En nat skulde en dreng p&#xE5; 15, 16 &#xE5;r v&#xE5;ge med hestene. Kl. 12 om natten h&#xF8;rte han noget i g&#xE5;rden, og han vilde da hen og se, men s&#xE5; sloges der tre slag p&#xE5; staldd&#xF6;ren. "V&#xE6;rs&#xE5;god," sagde drengen, og d&#xF6;ren sprang op, og der kom noget ind i stalden, som om det kunde tr&#xE6;kke med heste og f&#xF8;re dem til b&#xE5;s. Drengen blev ragt over ende, og hestene tumlede og klagede sig, som om de kunde blive plagede til d&#xF8;de. Drengen fik sig samlet op og fandt med besv&#xE6;r ud af stalden, kom hen og fik kaldt p&#xE5; Hals pr&#xE6;st -- han var p&#xE5; g&#xE5;rden i lang tid -- og han og g&#xE5;rdens folk kom op. Da pr&#xE6;sten kom ud i stalden, sagde han til drengen: "Du har ikke holdt din mund og past dig selv, da du h&#xF8;rte noget, endda jeg sagde dig det." Jo, han havde. &#x201C;Det er l&#xF6;gn i din hals," og s&#xE5; gav pr&#xE6;sten ham en p&#xE5; hovedet, s&#xE5; han trimlede. S&#xE5; kom han til sin fulde bevidsthed igjen, og pr&#xE6;sten l&#xE6;ste s&#xE5; noget, som ingen forstod. S&#xE5; begyndte det igjen at pusle i stalden, og da det h&#xF8;rte op, sagde pr&#xE6;sten: "Kan I se dem, der rider," men der var ingen, der kunde se nogen. De kunde h&#xF8;re hovslag ud af g&#xE5;rden og hen ad vejen. Siden var der ikke noget, der puslede, men hestene d&#xF8;de s&#xE5; n&#xE6;r som &#xE9;n, og den lagde sig aldrig mere, n&#xE5;r den var p&#xE5; stald, og d&#xF6;jede med at f&#xE5; munden til jorden, n&#xE5;r den var p&#xE5; gr&#xE6;s, den m&#xE5;tte b&#xF6;je kn&#xE6;ene ligesom sm&#xE5; f&#xF8;l.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>There was a mound south of S&#xF8;nderstrupg&#xE5;rd (S&#xF8;nderstrup farm) in Han district that was leveled forty or fifty years ago, and a windmill was built there. Inside the mound, there was a stone chamber where they say there were various small things that weren't saved. The stones from the chamber were used to build the foundation under the mill. An old legend tells that a dwarf king lived in the mound, and he was angry about this disturbance in his home and he swore that he would get revenge. It was the horses that came to suffer. The horses could go completely crazy in their stalls at night, and the veterinarian couldn't say what was wrong with them. At the time, there was an old theological student by the name of Hals minister who traveled about in Vendsyssel, and he'd make peace where things like that were going on. They also got hold of him at S&#xF8;nderstrupg&#xE5;rd. When he got there, more horses had died, and the others hung in their stalls since they couldn't stand. He said that it was the dwarf king who put his horses in the stalls, and that's why the other horses got sick, "but now let's see about getting rid of them." A boy fifteen to sixteen years old was supposed to guard them one night. Twelve o'clock at night the boys hears something in the farm courtyard, and he wants to go see what it is, but then he hears three knocks on the barn door. "Welcome," says the boy, and the door sprang open and something came into the barn, and the horses romped about and complained as if they were being tormented to death. The boy pulled himself together and, with great difficulty, managed to get out of the barn, and went and called Hals minister--he had been at the farm for quite a while--and he and the farm's people got up. When the minister got out into the barn, he said to the boy, "You didn't keep quiet and mind your own business when you heard something even though I had told you to." Yes, he had. "There's a lie in your throat," and the minister smacked him on the head so hard that the boy fell over. Then he regained consciousness, and the minister read something that no one understood. Then it started rustling about in the stalls, and when that stopped, the minister said, "Can you see them riding?" but no one could see anything. They could hear hoof beats that left the courtyard and went down the road. Since that time, there was nothing that rustled about, but all the horses died save for one. That one never lay down again when it was in its stall and had a hard time getting its snout to the ground when it was out grazing, it had to bend its knees like a little foal. </english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I Funder ved Silkeborg boede en gang en jordemoder, hvis navn var Gjertrud Ruds. En gang kom der bud til hende fra en mand, der hed Anders Borring, om hun vilde forl&#xF8;se hans kone. Jordemoderen gik straks, men p&#xE5; vejen m&#xF6;dte hun en stor skruptusse, der sagde, hun var en bj&#xE6;rgmandskone, og tillige bad hende, om hun vilde forl&#xF8;se hende, n&#xE5;r tiden kom, hvilket jordemoderen lovede. Nogen tid efter kom en bj&#xE6;rgmand til jordemoderen og bad hende, om hun vilde f&#xF8;lge med og hj&#xE6;lpe hans kone, som hun havde lovet. Hun fulgte med manden, og han f&#xF8;rte hende ind i en bakke, hvor hun forl&#xF8;ste hans kone. Da hun var f&#xE6;rdig og skulde til at g&#xE5;, gav bj&#xE6;rgmanden hende en pose fuld af h&#xF6;vlsp&#xE5;ner. Jordemoderen vilde ikke rigtig have dem, men bj&#xE6;rgmandskonen bad hende om at tage dem, hun skulde nok f&#xE5; sin ulejlighed betalt, sagde hun. Jordemoderen tog s&#xE5; posen, men da hun kom hjem og &#xE5;bnede for den, var h&#xF6;vlsp&#xE5;nerne blevne til blanke s&#xF8;lvpenge.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Once a midwife, whose name was Gjertrud Ruds, lived in Funder near Silkeborg. One time, a message came to her from a man whose name was Anders Borring, asking her to deliver his wife. The midwife left immediately, but along the way she met a large toad that said that she was the wife of a mound man, and asked her to deliver her as well when the time came, and the midwife promised to do so. A little while later, a mound man came to the midwife and asked her to come and help his wife as she'd promised. She followed the man and he brought her into a mound where she delivered his wife. When she was done and was going to leave, the mound man gave her a bag full of wood shavings. The midwife didn't really want them, but the mound man's wife asked her to take them, she'd be paid for her inconvenience, she said. The midwife took the bag, but when she got home and opened it, the wood shavings had turned into shiny silver coins.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>Once there were a pair who were engaged some place in Jutland, and a short while before their wedding day, the man died. The girl went about mourning him quite a bit. She worked for a parish clerk who lived a little ways outside of town close to the church, and one evening she'd been in town on an errand and was walking home again when she saw someone on horseback riding towards her on the way from the cemetery. The moon was shining clearly and she could see that it was her beloved. When the rider came close to her, he sang, 
"The moon shines brightly, 
the dead one rides sickly, 
aren't you afraid?" 
The girl stood stock still out of fright and the rider sang the same thing again, but when he began to sing it a third time, she started running home. When the rider saw that, he jumped off his horse and ran after her, but she managed to slam the door before he reached her and she could hear from inside how he stood outside scraping on the door.</english_publication>

The horse doesn't answer, of course, but it did slow down. "That was good that you could wait up, perhaps you could help me, I have a lot to carry. Things are pretty bad tonight, and so you can carry my package and me too." Then he jumped up on the horse and rode into town. When they got to the cemetery, the horse became as big as a house, and the man wound up hanging onto the upper most branch of one of the big trees that are around the cemetery, then he had to get down from there however he could. He crawled down, but it hurt.</english_publication>

A couple of men who witnessed the accident from the other bank at a little distance wanted to try and help the boys but they came too late.

The traveler heard this and, when the mound woman hands him the cup with the drink, he throws the contents over his shoulder and rides away with the cup in his hand, as fast as the horse can run. The mound woman tosses her breasts over her shoulder and ran after him as well she could. When he reached the place where Karup river cuts across the highway from Viborg to Holstebro, she was so close to him that she snatched a calk (hage) off one of the horse&#x2019;s shoes and from that time on the place is called Hage bridge. The mound woman couldn&#x2019;t cross over the running water and the man was saved. Later it turned out that a few drops of the drink had fallen on the horse&#x2019;s rump and had taken off both hide and hair.</english_publication>

Another girl, who was called Sanne, could see that kind of thing and she went out to try and meet it, but it kept going away from her. Then she went to the minister and asked him to give her some advice so she could talk to the revenant. He said that when she went out to meet it, she should say: It can happen in the name of Jesus. One night she met it well enough but she made the big mistake of saying: &#x201C;Well, can it happen in the name of Jesus.&#x201D; At the same moment, she sank to the ground from a hit. Since then, her health failed and a doctor&#x2019;s help was sought out but it didn&#x2019;t help. The revenant was later shown out of the farm and into the southwest corner of the field.

En aften, som nogle unge folk gik fra Martofte til Snave for at lege jul og kom t&#xE6;t forbi h&#xF6;jen, fik en lystig fyr iblandt dem det indfald at r&#xE5;be: "Hej, hej, bj&#xE6;rgfolk, vil I med til Snave at lege jul?" I det samme h&#xF8;rte de det r&#xE5;be inde i h&#xF6;jen: "Peder Mose, tag mig mine hose, jeg skal til Snave at lege jul!" Men da de derp&#xE5; h&#xF8;rte en snakken og buldren med kistel&#xE5;g derinde, blev de alle sammen bange og skyndte sig ad Snave til. Lidt efter viste sig i d&#xF6;ren til gildestuen en lille pusling, og folkene blev end mere bestyrtede, end de f&#xF6;r havde v&#xE6;ret. Dog nogle af dem b&#xF8;d ham ind, og han gik ogs&#xE5; og sp&#xF6;gte med dem en tid af natten.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Half way between Martofte and Snave lies Peder Mose&#x2019;s mound where dwarves used to live. One night, some young people went from Martofte to Snave to go to a Christmas party and they came close by the mound, and a daring young man among them had the impulse to call out: &#x201C;Hey mound dwellers, do you want to come to a Christmas party in Snave?&#x201D; Immediately they heard a yell from inside the mound: &#x201C;Peder Mose get my hose (stockings), I&#x2019;m going to Snave to a Christmas party!&#x201D; But when they heard talking and a slamming of chest lids down there, they all got scared and hurried to Snave. A little later a little goblin appeared in the door and the people were even more surprised than they&#x2019;d been before. But some of them invited him in and he also went in and joked around with them for a bit of the night.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>P&#xE5; Gravballeg&#xE5;rd i Svostrup boede for mange &#xE5;r siden en herremand, der var s&#xE5; slem til at pine sine b&#xF8;nder. Omsider d&#xF8;de han, og p&#xE5; begravelsesdagen fulgtes hans lig til jorden af en urimelig m&#xE6;ngde mennesker, der alle var glade. Men da f&#xF8;lget kom fra kirken, forvandlede gl&#xE6;den sig til skr&#xE6;k, for p&#xE5; en af staldd&#xF8;rene sad herremanden og galede som en hane. Fra nu af var det rent galt i g&#xE5;rden med sp&#xF8;geri. Til sidst hentede de den Gr&#xF8;nb&#xE6;k pr&#xE6;st, for at han kunde mane sp&#xF8;gelset ned. Han fik det ogs&#xE5; ned i et kj&#xE6;r t&#xE6;t ved g&#xE5;rden og ramte en p&#xE6;l ned igjennem det.

    <english_publication>Many years ago, a manor lord lived at Grovballeg&#xE5;rd in Svostrup, and he really tormented his peasants. After a while, he died and, on the day of his funeral, his body was followed to the grave by an unusually large number of people who were all happy. But when the group came out of the church, their happiness turned into horror because on one of the stall doors sat the manor lord and he was crowing like a rooster. From that point on, things were really bad with haunting in the farm. Finally, they sent for the Gr&#xF8;nb&#xE6;k minister because he could conjure the ghost. He got it down in a swamp near the farm and rammed a post down through it. The post stood there for many years, and they say that when anyone rocked it, a voice from below would shout, "Rock it up better! Rock it up better!"</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Jens Langkniv boede i Dalstrup i Harre. En mand fra Harre var kj&#xF8;rt vild og kommen ind i en skov. Da s&#xE5; han et lys og kj&#xF8;rte efter det.

"A vilde ret gj&#xE6;rne vide, hvor den rette vej g&#xE5;r herfra, for her kan a nok se, det er ikke for mig at v&#xE6;re." Jens Langkniv klagede sig lige s&#xE5; h&#xE5;rdt som manden. S&#xE5; viser han ham ogs&#xE5; den rette vej. "Nu skal du kj&#xF8;re alt det du kan, og s&#xE5; vil a g&#xE5; ind og snakke med dem." Jens gjorde det ogs&#xE5;, og den anden mand kom heldig og vel hjem og fortalte hjemme, hvordan han havde v&#xE6;ret i lag med Jens Langkniv der og var kommen godt fra det.

Then he said: &#x201C;I think I&#x2019;ve come into the wrong house,&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x201C;Well, me too,&#x201D; said Jens Langkniv. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d really like to know where the right way away from here is, since I can see that I shouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#x201D; Jens Langkniv complained just as strongly as the man. Then he shows him the right way. &#x201C;Now drive as fast as you can, and now I&#x2019;ll go in and talk to them.&#x201D; Jens did it too and so the other man luckily got safely home. He told them at home how he had been in the company of Jens Langkniv but had gotten out OK. But it was because he was his neighbor. Otherwise Jens Langkniv was in cahoots with the other robbers.</english_publication>

Otherwise two of your horses, the biggest and best, will lie dead tomorrow out in the swamp.&#x201D; The man hung the glove out on the end of a beam and a little later it was torn away so hard that the house almost tipped over.

    <english_publication>When H&#xF8;jslev church was to be built, what they built during the day was torn down at night. It was discovered that the mound man, who lived nearby, did it and the workers made the deal with him that he should build the church and also put as much gold and silver somewhere in the church so that it could be rebuilt if it burned down or got destroyed, and then he&#x2019;d get both the first and the last bride who were married in the church. He&#x2019;s gotten the first bride. When they drove to the church, they watched out carefully for her and she also got home OK, but when she took the bridal wreath off her head, the mound man got the power to take her. She came to live with him but every day she went to a spring and fetched water. Her father spoke with her and wanted to free her but she answered that she was happy enough where she was. The path where the mound man walked with her is always green both in summer and winter, and on the north side of the church there is a stone on which a little hat is carved and inside that lies the treasure with which the church is to be rebuilt. Once they tried to break open the stone but the attempt failed.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En Karl for en Ko.
Der var en Gang to M&#xE6;nd, der boede til Hobe; den ene var rig og havde en stor Gaard og nok af alle Slags, men den anden var i den sorteste Armod, og der var ikke Tanker om, at den rige Mand vilde give den fattige saa meget som Salt til et &#xC6;g. Nu skal jeg fort&#xE6;lle jer lidt om, hvordan de to kom til at omskifte deres Vilkaar.
     Det var gaaet den fattige saa n&#xE6;r, at han havde ikke uden &#xE9;n Ko, og den skulde han n&#xF8;dsages til at s&#xE6;lge for at faa Br&#xF8;d i Huset. Saa tr&#xE6;kker han til Marked med den en Dag, men da han kom til en Korsvej, kom der i det samme en Vogn kj&#xF8;rende med den anden Vej, og der sad en tre Karle paa. De spurgte ham, hvor han vilde hen, og han vilde saa ogsaa vide, hvor de skulde hen. Ja, de skulde da hen at h&#xE6;nge det Menneske, der sad imellem dem, for det var en Mestertyv,
     "Jeg synes, at det er en stor Synd at h&#xE6;nge ham", siger den fattige, "for det er jo et Menneske, der er frisk og rask."
Ja, det kunde ikke hj&#xE6;lpe, h&#xE6;nges skulde han. "Men maaske du kunde have Lyst til at at bytte og have en Karl for en Ko, saa kan vi blive fri for at h&#xE6;nge ham, og du faar din Vilje."
     Ja, det var ogsaa det samme, siger han, og saa bliver han resolveret paa at gj&#xF8;re den Handel med dem, og de beslutter dem til at sige, naar de kom tilbage, at Tyven var rendt fra dem.
     Saa faar han altsaa Karlen og tr&#xE6;kker af med ham til Markedet, men den hele Dag gik hen, og der var ingen, som kom og h&#xF8;rte til, hvad den Tyv skulde koste. Altsaa maa han have ham med hjem om Aftenen.
     "Naa, hvad fik du for Koen?" sagde Konen, da han kom ind.
     Ja, han havde da faaet denne her Karl for den. "Aa, du er altid tosset, og derfor har vi det, som vi har det, synes du ikke, vi har Folk nok til F&#xF8;den, siden du kommer med en til?"
     Ja, Manden tav jo til det, og saa skulde de have noget til deres Nadver; men Konen havde ikke uden en lille Klat Gr&#xF8;d og en Br&#xF8;dskorpe. Der var ikke til mere end en, men nu fik de jo bytte det, som de var Venner til, og saa havde de ikke det mindste til om Morgenen.
     Saa tager Mestertyven Ordet og siger, at det skulde hun ikke klage sig over, han skulde nok skaffe Br&#xF8;d, for han var ikke Tyv for ingen Ting. Men nu var det bedst, de tog det med Ko til om Morgenen.
     Da det saa gryede ad Dag, sp&#xF8;rger han Konen, hvad de nu tr&#xE6;ngte allermest til. "Ja", siger hun, "det er ikke saa godt at sige, for vi har hverken det eller det."
     "Saa er det vel bedst, vi f&#xF8;rst faar noget Br&#xF8;d, og saa vil jeg nu kj&#xF8;re til M&#xF8;lle for jer."
     "Ja, det kan nok sagtens hj&#xE6;lpe", siger hun, "vi har ikke Kornkj&#xE6;rne i Huset."
     "Har I da ikke et Par S&#xE6;kke og en Befordring?"
     Jo, de havde da begge Dele, og han faar et Par gamle Krikker sp&#xE6;ndt for en Pjalt Vogn og kommer til Kj&#xF8;ren med nogle tomme Poser bag i den. Da han saa kommer forbi en Sandgrav, holder han der og fylder alle S&#xE6;kkene med Sand. Dem l&#xE6;ssede han paa Vognen, og da han nu kj&#xF8;rte videre, var der ingen, der skulde have sagt andet, end at det var et stivt L&#xE6;s Korn, han havde at kj&#xF8;re med. Nu kj&#xF8;rte han til en M&#xF8;lle, hvor de havde en sv&#xE6;r S&#xF8;gning, og da M&#xF8;llersvenden netop havde travlt oppe i M&#xF8;llen, da han kom, saa bar han selv Poserne ind den ene efter den anden og satte dem ved en hel Del andre S&#xE6;kke. Nu gaar han op til M&#xF8;llersvenden og siger, om han kan faa malet i Dag.
     "Nej", svarer han, "vi kan ikke i Dag, for vi har saa meget inde, og det skal males f&#xF8;rst; men i Morgen maa du hente det, da skal det nok v&#xE6;re f&#xE6;rdigt."
     Ja, det kunde han ikke bie efter, for de havde intet Br&#xF8;d i den Gaard, hvor han tjente, og han skulde have det med sig tilbage; men saa fik han jo at tage et andet Sted hen.
     "Ja, det faar du jo", svarer M&#xF8;llersvenden, og saa gaar Tyven ned og b&#xE6;rer S&#xE6;kkene ud paa Vognen igjen; men han passede jo paa, at tage nogle andre S&#xE6;kke med Mel i. Nu kj&#xF8;rer han stiv Karl hjem med dem, og saa fik Konen travlt med at bage. Der blev saadan en Velsignelse af Br&#xF8;d, at de havde nok for lange Tider.
     Men nu var det ikke nok med det, for Konen lod sig forstaa med, at det var elendigt nu for dem ikke at have en Ko og saadan faa lidt Sm&#xF8;r at brede paa Br&#xF8;det. Saa siger Mestertyven, at det kunde der vel ogsaa blive Raad for. Om de havde ingen Sm&#xF8;rfjerdinger? Jo, dem havde de endda nok af, havde der saa sandt v&#xE6;ret noget i dem. "Jaja, nu kj&#xF8;rer jeg til Kj&#xF8;bsted og faar Sm&#xF8;r", siger han. Men det kunde hun ikke forstaa, siden de aldrig havde en Skilling at give for det.
     Han faar B&#xE6;sterne for og kj&#xF8;rer saa af Sted med nogle tomme Fjerdinger. Da han kommer til Sandbakken, fylder han dem med Sand og l&#xE6;gger hvert Laag nok saa kj&#xF8;nt paa. Derefter kj&#xF8;rer han til Byen og ind ad en Kj&#xF8;bmands Gaard, hvor han strax giver sig i F&#xE6;rd med at b&#xE6;re Fjerdingerne ind ad Pakhuset og s&#xE6;tter dem der lige Side med en Del andre Sm&#xF8;rfjerdinger. Saa gaar han ind i Butikken og siger, at han er her med et L&#xE6;s Sm&#xF8;r, om de vilde sige ham, hvad Pris de gav for det. Ja, de gav saa og saa meget. Nej, den Pris vilde han ikke s&#xE6;lge Sm&#xF8;r for, det var saa og saa godt, han kunde sagtens faa mere for det et andet Sted, og hvad han kunde nu rimle op. Ja, de gav ikke mere, sagde de, og saa rejste han af ud til Pakhuset og skulde nu have Sm&#xF8;rret l&#xE6;sset paa Vognen igjen, men passede naturligvis paa at faa nogle andre Fjerdinger, der var virkeligt Sm&#xF8;r i, og saa kj&#xF8;rte han lige hjem til den fattige Mand med det.
     De maatte rigtig love for Tyven, nu havde de baade Tilmad og Br&#xF8;d, og det var da saa meget dejligt.
     Saa tr&#xE6;ffer det i samme Godlag, at den rige Mands Bedstemoder d&#xF8;de, og der bliver jo gjort Anstalter til at faa hende jordet. Folkene omme fra den fattige Mands hjalp dem noget til Rette med det, og derfor blev de da ogsaa budne med til Begravelsen tillige med den fremmede Karl, der var hos dem.
     Saa om Eftermiddagen, da de havde spist, kommer de ud, det gj&#xF8;r Gj&#xE6;sterne, og skal til at se den rige Mands Kreaturer. Der havde de en fed Ko, som lige stod f&#xE6;rdig til at slagte, og alle syntes de jo, at den var i saadan udm&#xE6;rket Stand. Om Aftenen, da den fattige Mands Folk kommer hjem, siger Mestertyven, at det var bedst, de fik den Ko hentet, for den var v&#xE6;rd baade at slagte og spise. Ja, det var nok ikke saa nemt at komme af Sted med. Jo, sagde han, det kunde let lade sig gj&#xF8;re, og nu skulde de blot faa nogle Knive stenet, saa skulde han let hente Koen.
     Han gaar nu op paa Kirkegaarden og graver den gamle Kone op, som var bleven jordet, og hende b&#xE6;rer han ind i Kohuset og stiller hende an i den Baas, hvor Koen stod, og saa tr&#xE6;kker han Koen ud; men Halen skar han af den og stak ind i Munden paa hende. Da han saa er kommen hjem med Koen, slagter de den jo den samme Nat. Nu havde de Br&#xF8;d og Sm&#xF8;r og Kj&#xF8;d i Overflod.
     Om Morgenen, da Pigen kom ud og skulde have malket, sidder Bedstemoder jo der i Baasen og har &#xE6;dt Koen lige til Halen. Hun ind til Manden og fort&#xE6;ller, at Bedstemoder gik igjen og sad ude i Kohuset.
     "Det er da forskr&#xE6;kkeligt", siger den rige Mand, da han ser det Syn, "hun har altid v&#xE6;ret havefuld, imens hun levede, vil hun til at &#xE6;de hele H&#xF8;veder, nu hun er d&#xF8;d, saa er der jo ingen Raad til hende."
     De vidste da aldrig, hvordan de skulde b&#xE6;re dem ad, og de maatte da ned til Pr&#xE6;sten og fort&#xE6;lle ham, at Bedstemoder var kommen tilbage og havde &#xE6;dt den r&#xF8;de Ko for at stille hendes Sult, da hun ikke havde &#xE6;dt nu i saa mange Dage, om han kunde ikke hj&#xE6;lpe dem at faa hende sat v&#xE6;k, for hun gik begribeligvis igjen?
     "Der er ikke andre Raad," sagde Pr&#xE6;sten, "end at vi maa have hende jordet igjen."
     "Kunde Pr&#xE6;sten ellers ikke gj&#xF8;re noget ved det, saadan som at mane hende?" sagde Manden, "for jeg er r&#xE6;d for, hun ellers skal komme igjen. Jeg vil betale ham godt for det."
     "Jo, jeg skal nok gj&#xF8;re min Flid, m&#xF8;d kun nu med hende ved Kirkestetten, saa skal jeg indfinde mig og nok s&#xE6;tte hende v&#xE6;k for bestandig."
     Saa bliver hun jo begravet for anden Gang, og Pr&#xE6;sten fik hundrede Daler for hans Ulejlighed.
     Men Tyven gik om Natten efter hen og skrabte hende op igjen, og saa satte han hende ind i den rige Mands Spisekammer, hvor der var mange T&#xF8;nder og Ankere baade med &#xD8;l og Mj&#xF8;d og Vin. Det tog han alt sammen og bar ned til den fattige Mands, men de tomme T&#xF8;nder bar han derop igjen, og saa satte han Bedstemoder der inde ved en af T&#xF8;nderne med en T&#xF8;ndehane i Munden.
     Da Folkene nu kommer op om Morgenen, og Pigen lukker Spisekammerd&#xF8;ren op, saa ser hun jo den gamle sidde der inde, og hun farer ind og raaber: "Husbond! nu er Bedstemoder kommen igjen og sidder i Spisekammeret." Han kommer ned og skal have den Ting unders&#xF8;gt. Da viser det sig, at hun har drukket alt deres &#xD8;l og Mj&#xF8;d og Vin og sad endnu og sugede paa T&#xF8;ndetappen.
     Saa maa han op til Pr&#xE6;sten igjen og fort&#xE6;lle ham, hvor elendigt det endnu var, og i Nat havde hun haft en forskr&#xE6;kkelig T&#xF8;rst, og saadan og saadan var det da.
     Ja, siger Pr&#xE6;sten, det var nok noget, han ikke kunde have med at gj&#xF8;re.
     Jo, han maatte da endelig s&#xE6;tte hende v&#xE6;k endnu en Gang, saa skulde han faa to hundrede Daler.
Ja, saa fik de jo at m&#xF8;de ved Kirkestetten, han skulde da nok indfinde sig. Og det gik da saadan, at hun den Dag blev jordet for tredje Gang.
     Nu havde de fuldt op af &#xC6;delse og Drikkelse omme hos den fattige Mands. Men Mestertyven gaar alligevel op paa Kirkegaarden om Natten og kradser hende op igjen. Dern&#xE6;st b&#xE6;rer han hende ned i den rige Mands Storstue, hvor der stod et stort Skab, som var fuldt af Kl&#xE6;der, og det var noget, der baade kunde varme og holde. Skabet ryddede han jo, og Sagerne tog han med sig, men Bedstemoder lod han blive i Skabet.
     Da et af Kvindfolkene om Morgenen kom og vilde aabne Skabet for at faa noget T&#xF8;j, falder den d&#xF8;de ud og havde n&#xE6;r revet hende om Kuld. Hun kommer hujende og br&#xF8;lende ned til de andre og siger, at Bedstemoder sad inde i Kl&#xE6;deskabet. Ganske rigtig, nu var hun der igjen, og hver Kl&#xE6;destraad var henne, der havde v&#xE6;ret i Skabet; jo, det var i god Orden, hun maatte jo have frosset sv&#xE6;rt i de sidste Dage og havde nu faaet Sagerne sl&#xE6;bt bort, men var selv bleven lukket inde til sidst.
     Den rige Mand op til Pr&#xE6;sten igjen og fort&#xE6;ller ham Sagens Lejlighed. Nu vilde han give ham tre hundrede Daler for at s&#xE6;tte hende v&#xE6;k.
     Nej, han kunde ikke have med det at gj&#xF8;re, for han havde gjort sig al mulig Flid, og han kunde slet ikke forstaa, hvi hun saadan blev ved med at komme igjen. Men Manden lister jo ved ham, han skulde endeligen hj&#xE6;lpe ham til Rette med det, og saa faar han ham til sidst overtalt. Altsaa bliver hun begravet for fjerde Gang.
     Men det bliver det samme som f&#xF8;r. Tyven gaar hen og skraber Liget op om Natten, og saa b&#xE6;rer han hende ned ad deres Stald, hvor der stod to gode B&#xE6;ster, det ene noget yngre end det andet. Der s&#xE6;tter han Bedstemoder op paa det unge, saadan at hun rider bagl&#xE6;nds, og binder hende godt fast, samt l&#xF8;sner Hestens Grimeskaft. Om Morgenen, de kom op, og Karlen vilde ud at give B&#xE6;sterne, saa ser han strax, da han lukker Staldd&#xF8;ren op, at hun nu er kommen igjen og sidder skr&#xE6;vs over Plagen. Han faar da D&#xF8;ren lukket i en Fart og farer ind og klager sig elendig over det Syn, han der har set. Nu skulde Manden da ned til Pr&#xE6;sten igjen for at faa hende sat v&#xE6;k paany. Han s&#xE6;tter det ogsaa i V&#xE6;rk, i det han tr&#xE6;kker den gamle Hest ud og s&#xE6;tter sig op at ride paa den. Men nu var Staldd&#xF8;ren saadan i to D&#xF8;re, og da de om Dagen kun lukte Nederd&#xF8;ren, saa rev Plagen sig l&#xF8;s og springer ud gjennem D&#xF8;raabningen. Men Bedstemoder tarsk Hovedet ret saa haardt imod D&#xF8;rkarmen, da den sprang ud, og ved det Skrald kommer Manden til at se sig tilbage og opdager nu, hvad der er bag efter. Han blev saa r&#xE6;d, at han jager af Sted det bedste han kan. Men han red aldrig saa st&#xE6;rk, at hun enten var paa lige Side med ham eller ogsaa for af, og naar hun kom et St&#xF8;d forved ham, saa syntes han, hun sad og saa efter, om han kom. Nok er det, han kommer ridende ind i Pr&#xE6;stegaarden som en gal Mand, og Bedstemoder kommer flyvende bag efter. Pr&#xE6;sten h&#xF8;rer den Tummel og ser ud; da kan han kjende den gamle Kj&#xE6;lling, han nu havde begravet fire Gange, og han farer ud og raaber: "V&#xE6;k med hende, hende har jeg haft nok med at gj&#xF8;re!" Manden b&#xF8;nfalder ham jo om at s&#xE6;tte hende v&#xE6;k nok en Gang, men han siger, at han hverken vilde eller kunde have med hende at skaffe, og det kunde v&#xE6;re det samme, enten han vilde give lidt eller meget for det.
     Saa farer det jo af Sted, som det kunde, hjem igjen, og Manden var helt sagtmodig; hans Bedstemoder holdt godt nok Trop, og da han s&#xE6;tter Hesten ind i Stalden, rider hun ogsaa ind. Da Manden er kommen ind i Stuen, klager han sin store N&#xF8;d for Konen, nu vidste han ikke, hvad der var at gj&#xF8;re, og han var bange for, at de blev hende aldrig kvit. Saa siger hun, at hun vilde endda gaa om til deres Nabos og sp&#xF8;rge dem, om de havde ikke h&#xF8;rt tale om saadant noget f&#xF8;r, for det kunde i saa Fald godt v&#xE6;re, at de kunde vide dem et Raad til at blive skilt ved den Gjenganger.
     "Ja, gaa endelig derom", siger Manden, og hun rejser jo af.
     Da hun kommer der, fort&#xE6;ller hun, hvordan det stod sig hjemme, den gamle Bedstemoder, som de var med til Begravelse over, hun var den haardeste Gjenganger, de havde h&#xF8;rt om fjern og n&#xE6;r, for nu havde de haft Pr&#xE6;sten til at kaste Muld paa hende fire Gange og betalt ham godt for det, og nu havde de budt ham fire hundrede Daler for at gj&#xF8;re det femte Gang, men han hverken turde eller vilde indlade sig paa det tiere.
     Saa siger den fattige Mand, at han havde en Karl, der rimeligvis kunde begrave hende saadan, at hun skulde ikke komme igjen. Ja, da vilde hendes Mand betale ham godt for det, det vidste hun.
     Naa, Tyven bliver kaldt ind, og saa sp&#xF8;rger Konen ham jo, om han vilde tage sig paa at begrave deres gamle Bestemoder saadan, at hun aldrig mere skulde komme igjen. Han siger, at det kunde han sagtens, det var en smal Sag for ham. Han havde en stor Bog, som han kastede op i, og saa sagde han, at der var kun &#xE9;t Raad til at blive fri for det Gjengangeri, og det var, at den rige Mand skulde dele hans Gaard og Gods og lade den fattige Mand faa det halve af det, og saa forlods give ham selv femten hundrede Daler i Penge for hans Ulejlighed, ringere vilde han ikke gj&#xF8;re det. Ja, det vilde de ogsaa gaa ind paa, for de maatte af med Bedstemoder, ihvad det skulde koste. Rigtig nok vidste hun, at hendes Mand havde ikke de femten hundrede Daler, men hun var sikker paa, at han kunde laane dem. Ja, saa skulde han ogsaa nok indestaa for, at hun aldrig skulde komme igjen. Dermed fulgtes de ad hjem, og han tog Bedstemoder ned af Plagen og rejste af med hende op paa Kirkegaarden, hvor han puttede hende ned for femte Gang. Manden var saa ude om de femten hundrede Daler, og da Karlen fik dem, gik han hjem til den fattige Mand og gav ham de halve, men selv beholdt han de andre, og saa tog han Afsked med dem der i Gaarden og rejste hans Vej, for nu var de blevne hjulpne godt begge to. Den rige Mand var det saadan gaaet tilbage med, baade fordi han maatte af med de mange Penge, og fordi han maatte dele hans Gaard, at han var gaaet i Armod, men den fattige var bleven godt ved det, og saadan skiftedes det da om for dem ved den Mestertyv.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A farmhand for a cow
	Once there were two men, the one was rich and had a large farm and enough of everything, but the other one lived in utter poverty, and there was not even a chance that the rich one would give the poor one even salt for an egg. Now I am going to tell you a little about how the two wound up changing places.
	Things had gone so bad for the poor one that he had nothing but a single cow left, and it looked like he was going to have to sell it to get some food. So one day he drags it off to market, but when he gets to an intersection, a wagon all of a sudden comes driving up in the other direction, and there were three farmhands sitting in it. They asked him where he was going, and he wanted to know where they were going. Well, they were going to hang the person sitting in between them, because he was a master thief.
	"I think it is quite a sin to hang him," says the poor man, "because he is a strong, healthy person."
	Well, that didn&#x2019;t matter, he was to be hung. "But maybe you want to trade, and get a farmhand in exchange for a cow, and then we won&#x2019;t have to hang him, and you&#x2019;ll get your way."
	Well, that&#x2019;s all the same to me, he says, and then he decides to make that deal with them, and they decide to say when they get back that the thief had escaped from them. 
	And so he gets the farmhand, and drags him off to the market, but the whole day passed, and no one came and asked what the thief cost. And so he had to take him home that evening.
	"So, what did you get for the cow?" said his wife when he got home.
	Well, he had gotten this here farmhand for it.
	"Oh, are you crazy, and that&#x2019;s why things are the way they are here, don&#x2019;t you think we have enough people to feed, and now you come with another?"
	Well, the man couldn&#x2019;t say anything to that, and then they were going to have some dinner; but the wife had nothing other than a little clump of porridge and a bread crust. There wasn&#x2019;t enough food for more than one, but now they had traded the thing they were friends with, and then there wasn&#x2019;t anything at all for the next day.
	Then the master thief says that she shouldn&#x2019;t complain, he&#x2019;d certainly get them some bread, because he wasn&#x2019;t a thief for nothing. But now it was best that they calmed down until the next day.
	When the dawn was breaking, he asks the wife what they needed the most. "Well," she says, "I don&#x2019;t really know since we have neither this nor that."
	"Well, then it&#x2019;s probably best if we get some bread, and I&#x2019;ll drive to the mill for you now."
	"Well, that certainly won&#x2019;t help," she says, "since we don&#x2019;t have any grain in the house."
	"Don&#x2019;t you have a couple of sacks and a conveyance of some sort?"
	Sure, they had both, and he gets a pair of old nags harnessed to a tattered wagon and they set off with a couple of empty sacks in the back. When he passes a sand pit, he stops and fills all the sacks with sand. He loaded them up on the wagon, and when he drove off, no one would have said anything other than it was quite a load of grain he had there. Now he drove to the mill, where it was quite busy, and since the journeyman miller was busy up in the mill, when he got there, he carried the sacks in himself one after another and put them down next to a bunch of other sacks. Then he goes up to the journeyman and asks if he could get his grain milled today.
	"No," he answers, "not today, we&#x2019;ve got so much that has to be milled first; but you can come and get it tomorrow, it&#x2019;ll certainly be finished by then."
	Well, he couldn&#x2019;t wait for that, they didn&#x2019;t have any bread at the farm where he worked, and he had to come back with it; then he&#x2019;d have to go someplace else.
	"Well, you&#x2019;ll just have to do that," says the journeyman, and the thief goes down and carries the sacks back out to the wagon again; but he made sure that he took some other sacks that had flour in them. Now he drives quickly home with them, and the wife now got busy baking. They were blessed with more bread than they had had in a long while.
	But that wasn&#x2019;t enough, because the wife let it be known that things were pretty bad since now, without a cow, they couldn&#x2019;t have even a little butter to spread on the bread. The master thief says that they could get enough to afford a cow as well. Did they have any butter forms? Yes, they had plenty of those, if only there had been something in them. "OK, OK, I&#x2019;ll drive to the market town and get some butter to put in them," he says. But she didn&#x2019;t understand how he&#x2019;d do that since they didn&#x2019;t have a shilling to pay for it.
	He gets the horses harnessed up and drives off with some of the empty forms. When he gets to the sand pit, he fills them with sand, and puts each cover on nicely. Then he drives to the town and into a grocer&#x2019;s farm, where he immediately begins carrying the forms into the warehouse and puts them down next to the other butter forms. Then he goes into the store and says that he has come with a load of butter, and he wanted to know what they would pay for it. Well, they paid so and so much. No, he wouldn&#x2019;t sell butter for that price, it was so and so good, the butter, that he could certainly get more for it at some other place, and whatever, he just made something up. Well, they wouldn&#x2019;t pay any more, they said, and so he went out to the warehouse and was going to load the butter back into the wagon, but made sure, of course, that he took some other forms, which really had butter in them, and then he drove straight home to the poor man with it.
	They really praised the thief, now they had both bread and butter, and it was really wonderful.
	Then it happens that the rich man&#x2019;s grandmother dies that same day and they make all sorts of arrangements to get her buried. The people from the poor man&#x2019;s house helped out with that, and so they were invited to the funeral along with the new farmhand who lived with them.
	Then that afternoon, after they had eaten, the guests come out and are going to look at the rich man&#x2019;s cows. They had a big fat cow that was ready to be slaughtered, and everyone thought that it was in really remarkable shape. That evening, when the poor farmer and his people got home, the master thief says that it would be best if they went and got that cow, because it was ready to be both slaughtered and eaten. Well, it wouldn&#x2019;t be that easy to make off with it. Well, he said, it could certainly be done, they just had to sharpen some knives, and then he&#x2019;d easily get the cow. 
	He goes up to the cemetery and digs up the old lady who&#x2019;d been buried and he carries her down into the cow barn and puts her in the stall where the cow had been, and then he leads the cow out; but he cut the cow&#x2019;s tail off and stuck it in her mouth. When he had gotten home with the cow, they slaughter it that same night. Now they had bread, butter and meat in abundance.
	The next morning, when the hired girl went out to milk, Grandma is sitting there in the stall and has eaten the whole cow down to the tail. She runs in to the farmer and tells him that Grandma is walking again and is sitting out in the cow barn.
	"That&#x2019;s horrible," says the rich man when he saw that sight, "she was always gluttonous when she was alive, but if she now wants to eat entire head of cattle now that she&#x2019;s dead, there&#x2019;s not much that can be done."
	They had no idea what to do, and so they went down to the minister and told him that Grandma had come back and had eaten the red cow to still her hunger, since she hadn't eaten now in so many days, could he help them to get rid of her, since she probably would go again?
	"There&#x2019;s nothing else to do," said the minister, "then to bury her again."
	"Couldn&#x2019;t the minister do something like conjuring her?" said the farmer, "Because I&#x2019;m scared that she&#x2019;ll come back. I&#x2019;ll pay you very well for doing it."
	"Well, I&#x2019;ll do my best, bring her to the church gate, I&#x2019;ll meet up with you and get rid of her forever."
	Then she is buried a second time and the minister gets one hundred daler for his trouble. 
	But the thief went after her that night and scraped her up again, and then put her in the rich man&#x2019;s dining room, where there were lots of barrels and containers of beer and mead and wine. He took all of this and brought it down to the poor man&#x2019;s house, but he carried the empty barrels back up there, and then he put Grandma in there besides one of the barrels with a barrel tap in her mouth.
	When the people woke up the next morning, and the hired girl opens the door to the dining room, then she sees the old one sitting in there and she runs in and shouts: "Master! Now Grandma has come back again and she&#x2019;s sitting in the dining room." He comes down to investigate. It turns out that she has drunk all of their beer and mead and wine and was sitting there still sucking on a barrel tap.
	Now he had to go back to the minister again and tell him how bad things had gotten and that last night she&#x2019;d been horribly thirsty and so and so and that&#x2019;s how it was.
	Well, says the minister, he couldn&#x2019;t have anything to do with that.
	No, he really had to put her away one more time, then he&#x2019;d get two hundred daler.
	Well, then they could meet up again at the church gate, he&#x2019;d certainly be there. And so it went, and she was buried for a third time that day.
	Now they had filled up on food and drink down at the poor man&#x2019;s house. But the master thief goes up to the cemetery anyway and digs her up again. Then he brings her down to the rich man&#x2019;s living room, where they had a big closet which was filled with clothes, and these were clothes that were warm and durable. He took everything out of the closet, and he took the things with him, but he left Grandma behind in the closet.
	The next morning when one of the women went to open the closet to get some clothes, the dead one falls out and nearly knocks her over. She comes crying and screaming down to the others and says that Grandma is in the clothes closet. Sure enough, she was there again, and every stitch of clothes that had been in the closet was gone; well, that made sense, she'd probably been freezing these last few days and had now lugged the things off, but had finally wound up getting locked. 
	The rich man goes up to the minister again and tells him how things stand. Now he&#x2019;ll give him three hundred daler for getting rid of her.
	No, he couldn&#x2019;t have anything to do with that, because he&#x2019;d done his best, and he couldn&#x2019;t understand how she could keep coming back. But the man begs him, he really has to help him, and he finally convinces him. And so she&#x2019;s buried for a fourth time.
	But it's just like before. The thief goes and scrapes up the corpse at night, and then he carries her down to their stall where their two good horses stood, the one a bit younger than the other. He puts Grandma up on the younger one so that she&#x2019;s riding backwards, and ties her on tightly, and he loosens the horse&#x2019;s harness shaft. The next morning, when they wake up, and the farmhand goes out to feed the horses, as soon as he opens the barn door, he immediately sees that she&#x2019;s come back and is straddling the horse. He closes the door quickly and runs in and complains loudly about the sight he&#x2019;s seen there. Now the man goes down to the minister again to get her chased off once more. He starts off by taking the older horse out and getting up on it to ride. But the stall door was split and, since they only closed the bottom part during the day, the horse pulls itself free and jumps out through the opening. But Grandma slammed her head really hard against the head of the door frame when the horse jumped out, and when he hears the bang the man looks back and discovers what&#x2019;s behind him. He gets so scared that he rides off as fast as he can. But no matter how hard he rode she was either right next to him or a little ahead of him, and when she got a little in front of him it looked to him like she was sitting looking back to see if he was coming. He comes riding into the minister&#x2019;s farm like a mad man and Grandma comes flying in behind him. The minister hears the tumult and looks out; he recognizes the old hag that he now has buried four times and he runs out and shouts, &#x201C;Away with her, I&#x2019;ve had enough to do with her!&#x201D; The man begs him to get rid of her one last time, but he says he neither will nor can have anything to do with her, and it didn&#x2019;t matter if he&#x2019;d give him a lot or a little to do it.
	So they leave as best they can and head for home, and the man was completely resigned to this; his grandmother kept up and when he rode into the stall, she did too. When the man comes into the living room, he complains to his wife, now he didn&#x2019;t know what to do, and he was afraid that they&#x2019;d never get rid of her. Then she says that she is going to go down to their neighbors and ask them if they&#x2019;d ever heard of such a thing before, because it could be that they might know how to get rid of a revenant.
	"Yes, certainly go down there," says the husband, and she goes off.
	When she gets there, she tells them how things were at home, the old grandmother whose funeral they had attended, she was the worst revenant they had heard of near and far, because they&#x2019;d now had the minister throw dirt on her four times and paid him well for it, and now they&#x2019;d offered him four hundred daler to do it a fifth time, but he neither dared nor wanted to do that any more.
	Then the poor man says that he had a farmhand who probably could bury her so that she wouldn&#x2019;t come back. Well, her husband would pay him well for that, she knew that much. 
	Well, the thief is called in and the wife asks him whether he&#x2019;d take it on himself to bury their old grandmother so that she&#x2019;d never come again. He says the he could certainly do that, that was a little thing for him. He had a big book that he opened up and then he said that there was only one way to get rid of this revenant and that was that the rich man was to split his farm and estate and let the poor man have half of it, and in addition give him fifteen hundred daler for his trouble, he wouldn&#x2019;t do it for less. Yes, they&#x2019;d go along with that, because they had to get rid of Grandma no matter what it cost. She was pretty sure that her husband didn&#x2019;t have the fifteen hundred daler, but he could borrow them. Well, then he&#x2019;d make sure that she&#x2019;d never come again. Then they went home together, and he took Grandma down off the horse and went off with her up to the cemetery, where he put her down for the fifth time. The man had gone out to get the fifteen hundred daler, and when the farmhand got them, he went home to the poor man and gave him half, but he kept the rest, and then he took his leave from the farm and went his way, because now those two had been helped quite a bit. The rich man had become poorer, both because of the money he had had to pay and because he had had to split his farm, and he had become destitute, but the poor ones had made out well and that&#x2019;s how they&#x2019;d switched places because of the master thief.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Karby kirke har to klokker, fordi det fra f&#xF8;rst af var bestemmelsen, at det skulde v&#xE6;re en kj&#xF6;bstad. Da kirken var f&#xE6;rdig, og man begyndte at ringe med klokkerne, blev troldene s&#xE5; rasende og fortumlede, at de straks vilde have kirken reven ned, men det stod dog ikke i deres magt. Der skulde nu begyndes p&#xE5; at anl&#xE6;gge havn, men her fik troldene sig h&#xE6;vnet, ti hvor st&#xE6;rkt der end arbejdedes om dagen, blev det tilintetgjort om natten, s&#xE5; det blev umuligt at f&#xE5; havn, og derfor blev Karby, hvad den er den dag i dag, nemlig en ligefrem landsby.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Karby church has two bells because, from the very beginning, it had been decided that it was to be a market town. When the church was finished and they began to ring the bells, the trolls got so angry and upset that they wanted to tear the church down immediately, but they didn't have the power to do that. The people were now going to start building a harbor, but the trolls got their revenge there, because no matter how hard people worked during the day, it was destroyed at night, so it was impossible for them to get a harbor and that's why Karby became what it is today, namely a small rural town.</english_publication>

They put the pig in a bed and spread a sheet over it. Then the minister asked where the sick one was, and then they lifted the sheet and showed him the pig. But that trick had bad consequences for them. Because as soon as the minister saw what they wanted to do to him, he left the room and went to his wagon, and the farm and everything in it began to sink. In his haste, the minister had forgotten his book on the table; the table didn't sink before the minister had gotten his book. Then everything disappeared into the ground.</english_publication>

So he rode up and took it and rode off with it, but they ran after him. He rode out onto a rye field and they couldn't come after him there. Then they begged him to give them their silver back, and if he did he could have whatever he wanted. Then he asked to have the strength of twelve men. They promised him that, but then he wasn't to tell anyone how he'd gotten it because then he'd have to eat as much as twelve men. When he'd gotten that strong, the manor lord at &#xC5;kj&#xE6;r wanted to tempt him into revealing how it had happened, and then he said, "Well, if you'll feed me as long as I live, then I'll tell you." Ever since then, the manor lord had to feed him, and a pot was made so they could cook enough food for twelve men in it. It was called Svend Felding's breakfast pot and was in &#xC5;kj&#xE6;r until not so long ago.</english_publication>

When he got there, Jens Plovg&#xE5;rd wasn't home but his wife thought that he would come home that evening so he could wait, and she suggested that he go and lay down out in the barn. He goes out there too. During the night, Jens Plovg&#xE5;rd comes home, and his wife told him about this man from Ty who had been there. But she doesn't tell him that he is out in the barn. So Jens Plovg&#xE5;rd goes out to the barn too, and calls the devil to him and asks him where the pigs had gotten off to. The Evil One tells him that the man's neighbor had killed them and buried them in a sand dune he had near the farm. The man from Ty lies there listening to this and then he thinks that he could just as well go home. But he didn't get all the way home, since Jens Plovg&#xE5;rd had sent someone after him, and he had to go back and get the proper message from him.</english_publication>

The bell ringer discovered that there was a big piece of cloth tied around the clapper. While he&#x2019;s standing wondering about this, he sees a little grinning face on top of the bell with a red hat on.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>I en g&#xE5;rd i Kolby boede en nisse, han gik og hjalp til med at passe l&#xF8;wueret (kreaturerne), men en aften, da han gik og fodrede hestene, slog den ene hest ham. Siden den tid blev den hest jo l&#xE6;ngere jo magrere, folkene i g&#xE5;rden kunde ikke forst&#xE5;, hvordan det kunde v&#xE6;re, da den blev fodret godt. Endelig kom man i tanker om, at nis m&#xE5;ske havde en finger med i spillet, og en aften, da karlen havde fodret af, fj&#xE6;lede han sig ude i stalden. Lidt efter kom nis og ryddede alt foderet fra den magre hest og bar det om til den anden til straf, fordi den havde sl&#xE5;et ham.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>A nisse lived in a farm in Kolby, he went and helped to take care of the animals, but one night, when he was feeding the horses, one of the horses kicked him. After that, the horse got thinner and thinner, and the people in the farm couldn&#x2019;t understand why, since it was fed well. Finally they realize that nis might have a finger in the game and one night, after the farmhand had finished the feeding, he crept out into the barn. A little later, nis came along and took all the food away from the thin horse and carried it over to another as punishment because it had kicked him.</english_publication>

She went three times from the house to the lake, and finally she pulled her skirts up over her head, stamped a hole in the ice with her feet and put herself down. They could see by her her footprints how she had wandered back and forth, and the husband later said that if the child hadn&#x2019;t been quiet, then she wouldn&#x2019;t have done it. Later they often saw her revenant and heard her at Christmas time complain so loudly out there.

    <english_publication>There was a revenant at a manor farm that would never leave people alone. One evening, a poor man came and asked for lodgings. No, that wasn't possible, since that night a whole group of ministers were going to gather there. He said that he could perhaps be of service, and so they gave him a little room and a thin little candle. The ministers sat each one in their own room with a large candle and books in front of them. He sat down by the fireplace with the candle in front of him and he put a little book on the mantlepiece. Then he took a little knife and a stick out of his pocket, whittled a shaving and threw it into the fire, and said, "Now he is getting up." With the next piece: "Now he is at the cemetery gate." Next: "Now he is at the gate." With that they heard the dogs howl, and then the door flew open and the revenant raced from room to room like a wind and blew out the ministers' candles and left them in the dark. But he couldn't blow out the beggar's candle. Then he began to read. Etc.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>In Ry mill there was once a miller&#x2019;s wife who hanged herself. Why she did it, no one knew, but everyone knew that she walked again. Often it sounded like all the grinding mills had been started all at once in the middle of the night. Then when the miller&#x2019;s apprentice came up to check, everything was quiet. Soon she carried out her nightly spooking with the beds. She pulled the comforters off the people who lay in them. Yes, it got so bad, that they saw her at lunchtime at the table, where she served food to the people as she used to while she was alive. But as soon as someone talked about her, when she was visible in one place or another, she disappeared. Finally, according to what they say, she was conjured down in the river, under the mill bridge. An old man, who worked for her as a farmhand while she was alive later told the following: Seven years after the miller&#x2019;s wife hanged herself, I was lying in my bed at home and was wide awake. Then I heard something that was rustling across the floor and all of a sudden there was a chalk white shape standing by my bed and it smiled at me. I didn&#x2019;t get scared at all, even though I could see who it was. &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;You can certainly believe that I&#x2019;ve had a terribly hard time since I died, but now I&#x2019;m fine, so fine. I left here seven years too early and I&#x2019;ve had to suffer terribly because of that.&#x201D; &#x201C;God almighty,&#x201D; I yelled, &#x201C;Can I shake your hand.

Finally, they came upon something, but immediately the man began to laugh really hard.

Another time they wanted to try it and they went over to a cobbler to get him to help, but he didn&#x2019;t want to come along. So they went out there alone and began to dig but found nothing besides a rotten horse thigh that night. They took that along with them and, on the way home, and tossed it into the cobbler&#x2019;s front room to humiliate him. But sorry! The next day it was pure gold.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>Nisser er kjendte alle vegne. Der siges her, at n&#xE5;r en mand gj&#xF6;r mere fremgang end andre under lige forhold, s&#xE5; har han en nisse. I en by p&#xE5; Nordfalster havde to naboer hver sin nisse, men kun den ene mand gjorde fremgang, hvorimod den anden stadig gik tilbage; men det kom af, at den ene nisse hed Lystig, den anden Pasp&#xE5;.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>Nisser are known all over the place. It&#x2019;s said here that when a man makes more progress than others under similar circumstances, then he has a nisse. In a town in Nordfalster, two neighbors each had a nisse, but only one of the men made progress, whereas the other man continuously went backwards (economically); it was because one of the nisser was called &#x201C;Jolly&#x201D; and the other was called, &#x201C;"Watch Out.&#x201D;</english_publication>

Hun var s&#xE5; dygtig til at s&#xE6;lge sm&#xF8;r, men s&#xE5; en gang hun kom ud til Kj&#xE6;rteminde med hendes sm&#xF6;r, da havde hun taget fejl otting, og de blev ved at tage af den der ude, og den var lige fuld, den var ikke til at t&#xF6;mme. De slog den s&#xE5; i stykker, og da var der en stor skruptusse i bunden, det var den, der lavede sm&#xF8;rret. I den samme kones g&#xE5;rd tjente en karl, de kaldte Lars Rytter, og han var uens med hende. S&#xE5; en aften, han kom g&#xE5;ende hjem ad til g&#xE5;rden og kom forbi Kristen Andersens hus, da kom der en kat og sprang op p&#xE5; ham og rev ham i ansigtet. S&#xE5; siger han: "Du skal ikke komme til at gj&#xF8;re mig stort, for jeg v&#xE9;d D&#xE6;wlen l&#xE6;nke mig nok, du er Ma &#xD6;sterg&#xE5;rds." S&#xE5; forsvandt katten.

    <english_publication>There was an old woman in Martofte who was called Ma &#xD8;sterg&#xE5;rds. She was very good at selling butter, but one time when she came to Kj&#xE6;rteminde with her butter, she had taken the wrong container (eighth), and they kept taking from it there, it couldn't be emptied. They broke it into pieces, and then there was a large toad in the bottom, that was what was making the butter. A farmhand worked in the same woman's farm, they called him Lars Rytter, and he had a disagreement with her. Then one evening, he came walking along on his way home, and came past Kristen Andersen's house, when a cat came and jumped up on him and scratched his face. Then he says, "You aren't going to hurt me too bad, since I know, the devil chain me up, that you are Ma &#xD8;sterg&#xE5;rds." Then the cat disappeared. It happened in old Lars Madsen's farm, since that was his wife and Mads Larsen's mother.</english_publication>

    <english_publication>There's a cliff on the other side of Firebakke called Halds bakke (Hald's mound). One evening, some of the sheep at Klitg&#xE5;rd had disappeared, and the farmwife wanted to get up early the next morning to look for them. As she's walking along, she meets an old woman who is walking carrying a bucket on her head. She says good morning. The woman didn't answer. "Where are you from?" She was from Halds bakke and was going down to Rygs bakke (Ryg's mound) to bake with her sister. It was an old woman who told that story, and it had happened to her mother, so that happened a hundred years ago. The mound dwellers in that mound sometimes put their linen out.</english_publication>

They didn't get any peace in their graves either, and they go about shouting, "Here is the proper boundary!" and they have to keep doing that until the unfairly won land is given back to its proper owner.</english_publication>

Da s&#xE6;den blev mejet, gik karlen forrest i r&#xE6;kken, og han huggede sin le fast i noget, der blev h&#xE6;ngende ved leen. Da han s&#xE5; til, var det en menneskeknokkel, og da han tog den af leen, fl&#xF8;d der blod ud af benet.

    <english_publication>A farmhand once lost his temper and killed a hired boy and buried him out in the field. The boy was missed but no one had any suspicions about the farmhand and several years passed. Then it happened that they had seeded the field where the dead boy lay buried. When the seed was mowed, the farmhand was at the very front of the mowing line, and his scythe got caught in something, and it stuck to the scythe. When he looked to see what it was, it was a human bone, and when he took it off the scythe, blood bled out of the bone. Now he admitted what he had done to the other people and suffered his punishment for his misdeed.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>To tjenestekarle vilde pr&#xF8;ve at h&#xE6;nge sig for morskabs skyld. De trak lod om, hvem der skulde h&#xE6;nge sig f&#xF8;rst, og den, som loddet traf, stod op p&#xE5; en malkeskammel, bandt et reb om en bj&#xE6;lke, lagde sin hals ind i l&#xF8;kken og sagde til sin kammerat: "Nu sparker jeg skamlen bort, men n&#xE5;r jeg begynder at spr&#xE6;lle, skal du s&#xE6;tte skamlen under mig igjen." Den anden karl stod nu med skamlen i h&#xE5;nden og vilde passe p&#xE5;, men i det samme kom en hvid hare l&#xF8;bende helt langsomt ind gjennem loen. Karlen troede, at han kunde fange den, men det lykkedes ikke, og da han forpustet m&#xE5;tte opgive jagten og kom tilbage til den h&#xE6;ngte, var han d&#xF8;d.

    <english_publication>Two farmhands wanted to try hanging themselves for fun. They drew lots as to who was to hang himself first, and the one who got the lot stood up on a milk stool, bound a rope around a beam, put his neck inside the noose and said to his buddy: "Now I'll kick the stool away, but when I begin to struggle, put the stool under me again." The other farmhand stood there with the stool in his hands and wanted to keep close watch, but at the same moment, a white hare came running very slowly through the barn. The farmhand thought he could catch it, but he couldn't, and when he finally gave up the chase exhausted and came back to the hanging one, he was dead. It was probably the Devil in a hare's shape that wanted to lure the living farmhand away.</english_publication>

    <danish_publication>En gang kom en staldkarl i &#xC5;ker ud i stalden, og der st&#xE5;r en hoppe og springer og er meget urolig.

Han f&#xF8;ler i den og m&#xE6;rker noget ligesom en stoppen&#xE5;l, men den var s&#xE5; bl&#xF8;d, at han kunde b&#xF6;je den. S&#xE5; trak han den ud og gik tilbage i stalden med den. Jo, det var ganske rigtig en stoppen&#xE5;l med &#xF6;je, og han kunde alligevel b&#xF6;je den helt om. Han stak s&#xE5; spidsen ind i &#xF6;jet og kastede den i den tilstand ned i gr&#xE6;vningen. Om morgenen, da han kom ud i stalden, ser han til sin store forbavselse, at den n&#xE6;rmeste nabokone ligger og spj&#xE6;tter der i gr&#xE6;vningen med benene op over nakken og kunde ikke komme der fra.</danish_publication>
    <english_publication>One time a stablehand in &#xC5;ker went out into the stable and there&#x2019;s a mare and it&#x2019;s skittish and very ill at ease. He stands and looks at it a bit, and he decides to go up to it and feel its mane. And he feels something like the beginning of a mare lock. He feels about some more and notices something just like a darning needle, but it was so soft that he could bend it. Then he pulled it out and went back into the stable with it. Yes, it was a darning needle with an eyelet sure enough, but he could bend it completely over itself. He put the point in through the eyelet and tossed it like that down into the dung heap. The next morning when he came out into the stable, he sees to his great surprise that the next door neighbor&#x2019;s wife is lying and kicking about down in the dung heap with her legs up behind her head and she couldn&#x2019;t get out of there.</english_publication>

After a while, they let a bull out on the road and it went and brayed, and the gam became aware of it, and swung down and grabbed him in his claws and flew up on the mountain again with him, and ate his blood and his flesh. After that, the gam flew off on his way. And since then the town is called Gamsh&#xF8;j and now, after normal usage, Gjems&#xF8;.</english_publication>
