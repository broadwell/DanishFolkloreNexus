Deaf Lars and a woman whom he had stayed one night in Mørke. He apparently wasn’t married to her, because he was separated from his real wife. He was a glazier and drove around here with that woman and then the children he’d had both with her and the other one. After they’d spent the night there, and the farm wife was out milking, the woman yells out to Lars, he was so deaf: “It’s not quite right here Lars, a hare ran through here last night.” “So what?” he said. “These poor people, they’re unlucky.” It was out in the barn that this conversation took place and the woman who is milking hears this, because they were talking loudly, and she runs in to her husband and says: “These people out here said so and so to each other, shouldn’t we find out what is going on?” Sure. Well, the farm wife goes out to them: “What is it you’ve been talking about? Are we unluckyy?” Then Sidsel says yes. “What should we do?” Well, she’d tell them what to do. They should dig a hole by their bed, but they couldn’t tell anybody about it and she was to be given 20 rixdollars. Then they went around in town and borrowed the money and the woman started to dig near the bed. She made it seem as if she found a mole skin that was filled with stones there and that was to be burned which they also did. But the people otherwise didn’t find out what kind of monster it was that was plaguing them. She said that she’d buried the money, but that wasn’t true; they’d taken them (the money) and the people had to feed them for many days. Finally the townsmen noticed and they made a big deal chasing Deaf Lars and his gang away. Sidsel Rollands was put in jail because she was the one responsible for the whole thing.
