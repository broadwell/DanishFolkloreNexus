A farmhand once met a pair of grass snakes that were slithering about, and he killed one of them. But after that, the other one wouldn't leave him alone, wherever he was, it followed him, and finally he died. I have heard that if you kill a viper king, the vipers will never leave you alone, you could be sure that you'd get bitten.
