A farmhand who was seriously plagued by nightmares got the boy to help him one night. He blocked all the holes into the room except for one because the mare was supposed to come in through it, he thought. Then the boy was to get up when he noticed something was wrong and block that hole too. Then he was to call to the farmhand so he could become himself again. The boy did this too, and in the morning there was a girl with them in the bed. Nobody knew her and she didnâ€™t know where she had come from or anything else for that matter. The farmhand was the son of the farm owner and he married the girl and inherited the farm and they had a lot of kids together. Then one day he wanted to show her the hole that she had come in through and then she scooted back out of it and he never saw her again.
