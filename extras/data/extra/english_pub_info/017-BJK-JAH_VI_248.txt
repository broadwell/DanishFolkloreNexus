There was supposed to be someone conjured down in Sørvad. Late one night, my mother was walking from Torstedlund and had to go by that place and then she all of a sudden sees a strange glittering in front of her, and it continued for quite a while, until she finally got up to it. She went and thought, “Now he’s coming  (the revenant),” but it wasn’t anything but the parish clerk from Årestrup, Niels Krafsen, who was walking along making sparks with his flint lighter the whole time. “You almost scared me to death,” he said, “I thought you were a revenant, and that’s why I kept making sparks. Now you can wait a bit and we can accompany each other.” No, she didn’t want to wait there, and so she went her way. It was strange that someone like the parish clerk was just as afraid of the revenant as my mother.
