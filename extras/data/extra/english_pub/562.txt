A man from down south here, from Hornum, had sold a couple of steers and was to deliver them to an innkeeper in Vammen. When he gets there, there's a fine person sitting in the taproom, and he watches as the man got paid for the steers. Then they were going to drink on the deal, and the fine person wanted to have a toddy with them. When they were done with that, he said, "Let's have three more, so I can have something to spit with when I go through the forest." At the time, Lindum forest had a bad reputation. Then they followed along with each other, and the man had a really nasty dog with him. Then the fine person says: "Would that dog hurt anyone?"--"You bet it would," says the man. Then he pulls out a rapier and chops the head off the dog. "Will you now give me the money for the steers?" He was willing to do that. He counts them out on a tree trunk. "But now you could do me the favor of chopping off my right hand so that my wife can see that I encountered some nasty people. But hit really hard so that it won't sting too much." Then he swings, but the other one pulls his hand back, so that the rapier gets stuck in the tree trunk. The robber stands there and reaches for something in his pocket. At that moment, the other one grabs him and ties him up with his stockings. Then he feels in the robber's pockets and finds a little whistle, that's what the robber was looking for to call his buddies. "Will you follow me now!" -- No, he wouldn't, so he smacked him five or six times, and that helped, now he'd come. They go to the parish bailiff and he admits that they were three robbers altogether. Then he shows them where the other two are, and all three of them are caught.
