In a place near a field marker, travelers along the road had often heard a cry: “Where may I set it down?” but nobody dared answer him. One night, a little boy accompanied his father over to the field near there, and they also heard the voice, and the boy asked the father permission to answer, when they heard the cry again. The father hurried to correct the boy by promising him a severe beating if he tried doing something like that, “since” he added “no one can know if you answer, whether or not you’ll have more to do with the revenant than you’d want to.” A little later they heard, “Where may I set it down?” and without thinking the boy said: “Set it down where you’re standing!” “Thanks,” came the answer and after that it was never heard again. The people in the area thought that the one who had cried out had probably moved a marker when he was alive, and that’s why he couldn’t get peace in the grave until it was righted.
