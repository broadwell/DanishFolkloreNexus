There was a place where there was a lindorm buried, and just as long as the stone wall that was over it, that’s how long the lindorm had been. It had eaten a man, and a horse in its harness and a plow, and then it had slowed down because of that, and then someone had come over and stoned it to death with the stones from the stone wall. Then they built the wall over it there where it lay and that’s how that came to be. Sure, it sounds strange, but you’ve got to understand that the horses were smaller back then and they used wooden plows. My great grandfather told me where it was, but I can’t remember.
