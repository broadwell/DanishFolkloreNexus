The farmhands in Aggersborg parish agreed to hurt Mads Speitzer at Aggersborggård. One evening, they encountered him near the cemetery embankments and they grabbed him, put one of his hands on a stone, took another stone and crushed it. The manager saw that, and they caught one of the farmhands whom he’d recognized and arrested him back at the farm. The other farmhands wondered where he was, and so they went home to get pry bars and other tools to get him out. He was down in the cellar and could answer them. So they began to dig out the cobblestones outside. Speitzer and the manager noticed that and so they went and released the farmhand voluntarily. That same night, all the farmhands fled the parish, because they knew that they’d all be punished as a group the next day, and they were never heard from again.
