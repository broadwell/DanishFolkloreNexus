During the time when the plague raged here, all of the people on Hjan island died except for one, and that was an old woman who was left. She was almost unable to get all of the dead buried since she was both old and weak. Finally people came over to the island, and the first thing they looked for was to see if they could find clay to build houses out of. After the plague, there were a lot of villages in which there wasn’t a single person. But then some figured out that they could light fires at night to find each other. A lot went off to church or to work in the fields or to town but died before they got home. The sickness started with sneezing, and when the sick person had sneezed three times, he was dead. The corpse quickly became black, and therefore the plague got the name the black death. Since that time, it's been the custom to say to someone who sneezes: God bless you. 
     I also heard told that the person who dug graves at Rårup cemetery could stand and see when they came with a corpse from Klejs village (in the same parish) and then get up to the grave first before the corpse they were bringing from Klejs.
