Anders Bak's paternal grandfather and grandmother and a farmhand came driving one night from Ålborg and saw a fire at Sortehøj (Black Mound) and a whole flock of small beings that ran from the fire down to the field and back again. The men wanted the woman to stop the horses while they investigated what it was, but she wouldn't let them.
