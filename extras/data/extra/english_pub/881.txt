This here Rosendal from Rødding was incredibly good at conjuring. There was a thicket near Hummelgård in Krejbjærg, and a man walked again there. He apparently came from a manor farm that had lain not too far from there. The farm was called Krøgeborg, and there are still some ruins from the old castle. It was horrible that that ghost came up again. Then the minister had to go over there and conjure him. The driver could feel a great unease, and heard that big words were being spoken. Then he takes a whip from the wagon and wants to go out and smack the Old One with it. But he injured the minister so bad by doing that that he had to race the Evil One to Krejbjærg church. When he got there, the Evil One stuck his head up out of that little dale south and west of the church and gave a loud roar and disappeared when he saw that the minister had come first. One can still see down in the thicket where he was conjured down, there's actually a green spot there.
