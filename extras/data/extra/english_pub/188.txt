There’s a farm in Astrup called Torne. The old Kristen Torne, who was the grandfather of the current farm wife, he remembered that a woman traveled to Norway with wolves, and that witch occupied herself with freeing other witches who were to be burned. No witches have been burned here in this country since. He said to her, when they met, “Good day, mother! You’ve got yourself a good pack of trouble [plagues].” Yes, she had, but she hadn’t gotten them all, there were two left, but they were lame. Right then he sees a wolf go running up on a mound that’s been called Wolf Mound ever since, and it sat down on its ass to howl and immediately after another one came up to him. Then both of them had to follow the others and since then there haven’t been wolves here in the country, those were the two last ones.
