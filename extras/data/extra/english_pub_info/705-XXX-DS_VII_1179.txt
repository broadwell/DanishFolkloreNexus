Their calves in Aggersb√∏l died. They got three red dots over their nose and then they died. Our neighbor worked there at the time and saw it. Then they sent for the cunning man in Smidstrup. He came there in the evening and stayed the night. In the morning, he came running in to the people before it was light and before they had gotten up, and was wearing only his underwear and said, "You have visitors." Well, they didn't know anything about that. Then they went to check the house. They did that and they found an old woman who had come into their female pensioner through a back door, and it was her best friend. Now he wanted to see her before she saw him, and then she was not to come that way any more. She had to leave by the door, and when she got out, she looked through all the windows, but he hid behind a post until he saw her. She kept looking through the windows, but the moment he saw her, then he stood out in the open and said that she could see him now. After that time, she could never come to the farm except by the church road, and then through the gate and then the main door. She tried to come in all sorts of other places but couldn't. No one found out what kind of tricks the cunning man had done, but since then nothing died at the farm.
