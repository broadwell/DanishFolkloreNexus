There was an old one who was called Karen Indjarsdatter (Ingvarsdatter), she chased all of the wolves away from the country. As far as I know she was from the town here. Somebody came toward her on the path down here near Torstedlund, and she came riding on the first one and had them all linked together. Then he says, “You’ve got quite a pack of trouble to ride on.” And she answered, “I should thank you a great deal for saying that, you saved my life with that because if you’d called them by their true name, they would have torn me apart.” Then she rode on and showed them out into the ocean. But whether they drowned or went on to Sweden, I don’t know anything about that.
