An old Norwegian once came to Søgård (Lake farm) on Holmsland to beg. He’d been to the farm before on the same errand, and the mistress of the farm did not take kindly to him. When she saw that he was coming now, she ran over and let the watchdogs loose. The Norwegian couldn’t move from the spot now because of the dogs and meanwhile the mistress stood in the door and laughed with all her might. The Norwegian bit his lip over this crude joke and since he could both “bless” and “show again,” he yelled to the mistress while pointing at a linden tree that stood nearby: “If that tree could talk, then you’d shut up.” Later, they dug under the linden tree and there they found the bodies of two little boys. The mistress admitted that they were hers, she had killed them herself, and so she was later executed.
