Frederik Glarmester was a stall hand at Vilhelmsborg, he said that his mother was a troll, she had to go to Troms church every Voldborg Eve (Midsummer’s Eve). When he had become a big boy he decided that he also wanted to try that ride. He rode on a broomstick and his mother rode on a rake. But he hadn’t really caught what she said and then he said: “Up and down and up and down” and then he continued to the top of the chimney and then down again, and he continued like that until it became day, and it wore all the clothes off of him, both his shirt and pants, so there soon wasn’t a stitch of clothes on him when he finally got free and could go his way.
