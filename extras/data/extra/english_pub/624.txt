Down in Østervelling woods there was a big hill, which they called Mandbjærg, and there were mound dwellers in it. When I was a little boy, it happened that a woman from Østervelling who had been down in the meadow near Nørre river came walking up through the woods and then she saw two little boys running on the mound. Then she thought that it was her own boy and me and she called to us and then went around the mound, but then there was nobody to see. Then she went home, scolding the boys for being bad. When she got home, we were there and hadn’t gone anywhere. Then she realized that it was mound dwellers she had seen. They had red hats on and we wore ones like that at the time.
