A man in Åby was digging on a mound that he had on his field and he wanted to get rid of. Then he comes to a copper kettle and it was full of money. But when he was going to touch it, it was just shit and dung, because he’d been so careless as to talk. At least he had that belief. He made a coffee pot of the copper kettle.
