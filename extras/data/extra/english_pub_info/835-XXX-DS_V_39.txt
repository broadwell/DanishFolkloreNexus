A man in Endelave was out in a marsh (out to the north in the direction of the point) hunting. As soon as he'd shot his first shot, he hears a horrible noise and racket. The man got scared and hurried back home, but he hadn't run very far before a calf with a pair of big red eyes jumped up on his back and threw its forelegs around his neck. Finally he remembered that he'd heard that all haunts had to yield in the face of sharp metal, and he pulled out his pocket knife and stabbed at the calf with it, and it immediately left him.
