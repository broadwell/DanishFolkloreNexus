Rokkergyden (Rakkergyden) [Rakker alley] stretches from Trunderup town in Kv√¶rndrup parish west toward the Svendborg-Odense road. Close to the alley north of the town is Rokker swamp, which is now a meadow, and right up next to that down toward Stevnbo farm is a pond where a human skull has lain for a long time. It has come to light several times when the pond has been cleaned, but they've always tossed it back again when the work was done. Old people say that there have been other skeleton parts in the pond, for example a thorax, and all of that is supposed to have come from a Jew--a wandering peddler--who had been killed and his chest of wares stolen. Some say that it was the townsfolk who robbed him and had thrown the dead body into Rakker swamp. 
      A headless man walks between the pond and Rakker alley, and that's supposed to be the revenant of the murdered Jew, but that seems to be a later addition.
