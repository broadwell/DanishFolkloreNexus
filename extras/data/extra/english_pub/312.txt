They used to use pea bread, and that was rank, since they couldn’t raise rye, since they were clay fields; they had to go off to the sand fields near Torsager for rye. In the morning when they called people to breakfast and they opened the door, you could smell the pea bread out in the barn. My grandmother told me that her father told her that when the enemies had been here, they were happy to lie out by the stall dunghill and eat their pea bread, since they couldn’t come inside because of the enemies.
