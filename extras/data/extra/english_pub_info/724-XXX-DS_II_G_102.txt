Two farmhands are out digging peat, and then they lie down after they've had their lunch, and the one falls asleep immediately. Then the other one sees that a white mouse runs out of his mouth, and there's a stream and it runs over there and it scurries about there, and so he gets up and goes over and lays his shovel over the stream, it was a long, hooked shovel. Then the mouse runs over. On the other side, there was a big ant hill with horse ants, and the mouse runs into the ant hill. A little later it comes out and runs back into the mouth of the farmhand. The other one doesn't say anything. "I had such a bad dream, and was in great danger." "What happened?" says the other one. "I had to get over a large body of water, and I couldn't, but then something came and lay down a bridge, and I went over, and over on the other side there was so much money, it was incredible the amount of money there was." The other farmhand still kept quiet and didn't say anything and they went home. Later, the other farmhand went back and dug the ant hill aside, and there he finds a pot filled with money. He took that and kept it for himself.
