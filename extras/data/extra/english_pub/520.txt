Syvstykkehøjen (Seven piece mound) lies out on Anders Sørensen's field in Viksnæs. One evening, a midwife was waiting for a call from a woman she was going to assist, and someone came and knocked. "Is that you, Per Skomager (Shoemaker)?," she said from inside. "Yes," came the answer, and so she went out, but it was the troll from Syvstekkehøjen. He put her on his back and carried her out to a carriage, and drove her right into the mound. There was a Christian woman in labor there, and she helped deliver her, and then she was driven home again and was well paid for her service.
