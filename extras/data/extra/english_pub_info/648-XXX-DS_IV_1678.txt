A bishop lies buried in the bishop’s grave in Sjørring cemetery who is believed to have brought the plague into the country. There had been a storm for several days, but then the weather got better. Two men from Dollerup wanted to go to the beach to scavenge, and there they found a deck house in which there was a well-dressed man. They wanted to kill him at first, but he begged them to let him live and bring him to the minister. They take him and lead him to Sjørring church and get there just as the minister and the congregation were coming out of the church. The minister now blesses him and immediately afterward the man dies. The flesh falls from the bones and most of the people who were present get sick and die. But before he died, he explained that he was a bishop from Antwerp and was going to Børglum parish to be bishop. But he didn’t get there, now his grave was to be in Sjørring. The two men who carried him there survived the plague. For twelve or thirteen months a fog lay over the area and during that time the plague raged. There was the belief that anyone who saw the sun could live and therefore they kept those who they could outside, but most people were so bad off they couldn’t be outside.
