An old man from Tøndering named Per Sig had been out walking one evening off to the east, and came through some hollows. There he heard such a strange whistle and rumbling that he got half scared. When he got home, he said, “Now we’re going to have war, because I’ve heard a portent of the enemies, it was just like in 1864, when the artillery drove along.” It wasn’t for war, but a portent for the railroad, which passes a little ways from his house.
