Jørgen Birkebæk only buttoned the top part of his vest, and people told that he had made a pact with the Evil One that he could come and take him when he'd finished, but in that way he never finished putting on his clothes. He was a hard one to get a straight answer from. "How is your buckwheat this year, Jørgen?" -- "Triangular." -- "What does that give you?" -- "As much as we thresh from it." He was supposed to sell a steer at Kolemorten market. "What did you raise that in [What did you hold it in]?" -- "By rope." -- "But what do you want for it?" -- "Money." -- "Sure, but how much?" -- "As much as we can agree on."
