My master once told me the following: In my youth I was out one summer night walking with a girl out in the woods. All at once I saw a little ways ahead of me that a man was riding a horse and had the reins of another in his hands and he was coming towards me. I stepped aside with the girl in between some trees and stood there while he rode past with the two horses. Even though it was totally quiet, I could not hear the slightest sound of the horsesâ€™ hoof beats on the ground, everything glided silently past us, and I truly believe it was a revenant.
