Lars Kusk from Ersted, who’d worked for the baron at Lundbæk, he said that there was a mute person who lived there, perhaps they got something for having him there, and one day they were out digging out a mound and the mute one had come along. He pointed up to the sky and then down to the ground and made so many signs, and then the baron got scared and said that they should let the mound be. The mound was supposed to be driven off to a marl pit, and the mute one would work everywhere except for on the mound. He’d just stand there babbling and pointing and then he scared the baron off when he came out to them.
