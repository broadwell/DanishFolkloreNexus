Once before the old war (1807), two men were walking between Nielstrup and Rude church one evening. Then they heard what sounded to them like an entire regiment coming down the road. They could hear that the horses huffed, because it was cavalry—and the swords clanked. They rode off the road and got down and lay down and rested near a small thicket, they call it mound thicket—it's down near Hvalløs vide. The men could hear that there was murmuring between them, and it sounded as if the soldiers were mumbling, because they couldn’t distinguish individual voices. The sound disappeared and they didn’t know what had happened to it; but later they realized that it was an omen of the war they’d heard.
