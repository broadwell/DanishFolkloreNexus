On Legårdslyst field there’s a whole bunch of warrior graves, and it's believed that Niels Ebbesen is buried there because that was where he fell. You see, at that time, Mos lake was connected to the ocean, so they could sail up there, and all of the meadows were under water. The Danes had a raft that they could get up on when the going got rough, but the Germans who were after them, got stuck in the mud. The Danes won the battle that way. But Niels had to stay there, and so they raised a stone for him. There are also some battlements at the same place.
