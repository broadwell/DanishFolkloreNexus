A werewolf looked like a normal wolf except that it only had three legs. It was a cursed man, who during the day was like everyone else, but on certain nights became a werewolf and wandered widely about. A person could be freed from this unfortunate condition by eating a child's heart. Pregnant women therefore would only under great duress walk alone at night, but even if they had but a little boy with them, then the werewolf had no power. In the same way, a werewolf could be freed if someone said to it when it attacked a pregnant woman, "You're a werewolf!"
