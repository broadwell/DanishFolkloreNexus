Has been in Mejlby for sixty-four years. She was a hired girl until she was thirty. Married for twenty-six years to Kristen Jensen Ottesen. Pensioner, now a widow for twenty-six years. Six children of which four are still alive. So healthy that she recently went to Randers and back in one day, and was just a little stiff in her legs the next day. Last year she worked in the harvest seven half and three whole days, and this year she’d been out weeding beets, and recently she’d gone to gather clover. Still goes to work whenever someone wants her. She receives 130 crowns in old age pension. She also learned stories and ballads from wandering merchants, when they stayed at that farm where I worked. They gave me four shillings to polish their boots and I learned their stories since I learned things so easily. Had worked as a wheat bread woman for many years. Her mother, Birte Nielsdatter, died when she was four years old.
