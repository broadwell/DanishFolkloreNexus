A hag from here in Vendsyssel drove the wolves away. She bound them together with a red iron cable, and then she got up on one of them and rode off and then went out into the North Sea. When anyone met her, they were to congratulate her on her foals, they couldn't say wolves, because then they would eat her up. Someone came up to her too, and he said well enough, "Congratulations with your many foals."
