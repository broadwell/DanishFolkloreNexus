In the old days there was an inn in the most western part of Ugilt parish at the place that is just east of Ilbro at the road into Ugilt. They had an old barrel of mead here which had a thingamajig in it, they called it a Basilisk, and it thrashed about in the barrel so that it could be heard an entire mile away. They were afraid that the barrel was going to break because if that happened then something really bad would happen. There was an old legend that said that when it smashed a barrel and saw people, they’d die immediately. They threw the barrel down the embankment west of the road in Spangerhede’s field. They could hear it knocking about in the barrel down there for quite a while, almost an entire year, but finally it got quiet and then that filth had died.
