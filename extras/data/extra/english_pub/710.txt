A girl in Søndergård in Øsløs had had a child in secret and had thrown the child to the dogs. A little later there was a great disturbance among the horses and the cows in the stalls, and the dogs howled out in the yard. There was also haunting in an attic room there. Another girl, who was called Sanne, could see that kind of thing and she went out to try and meet it, but it kept going away from her. Then she went to the minister and asked him to give her some advice so she could talk to the revenant. He said that when she went out to meet it, she should say: It can happen in the name of Jesus. One night she met it well enough but she made the big mistake of saying: “Well, can it happen in the name of Jesus.” At the same moment she sank to the ground and was hit. Since then, her health weakened and a doctor’s help was sought out but it didn’t help. The revenant was later shown out of the farm and into the southwest corner of the field. It can still be noticed at certain times out there, and also in the attic room.
