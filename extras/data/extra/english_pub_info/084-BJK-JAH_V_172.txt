There were some tough guys who lived here in the town. They’d fight and drink and tumble about, and the next day they’d make up by drinking a bottle of brændevin (distilled spirits). One could get brændevin  in Årestrup at the weaver’s, and then they had enough gall to go to church. They’d sit there and drink on Sundays and get so drunk that they’d carry each other home. Old Jens Indersen (Ingvorsen), he was a big and strong guy, and his neighbor, Sören Östergård, who was lame and got drunk more easily, they lived over on the south side of the town, and then old Jens would put him up on his back and he’d set off with him, saying, “Now I’m riding, let the devil take me, your body over to Skjörping.” That’s how he’d answer when Sören asked him, “Where are we riding to?”
