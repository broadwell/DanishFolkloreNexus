There was a man they called Klemmen in Sorte-Mose--that’s in Hortshøj parish--they always went to him when they wanted something shown again. Then a woman came to him and wanted him to show two feet of canvas. “Sure, you can see the woman,” he said, and then he put a tub of water in the middle of the floor and a mirror in front of her and a mirror behind her, and she was supposed to see the woman in the water there. “Because if I told you, you wouldn’t believe me, but when you see it for yourself, you’ll believe it better, because it's one of your best friends.” When it had burned over at Jens Klemmensen’s in Hårup, Klemmen came and visited him because they were such good friends. Then he wanted him to show a small dog again that had disappeared during the fire. I worked there, that’s why I know that. “Well, if the dog’s alive I’ll get him for you, you can meet him tomorrow morning by the door, he’ll be standing there and really happy to see you.” It happened too. The next morning, the dog met him at the door. One time Klemmen was on his way to Løgten, and they decided to make fun of him. But he chased one of the men out so he stood in mud up over his ankles until he [Klemmen] came back and so that guy at least didn’t get to Løgten. When Klemmen got back, he set him free. “Yeah, now you’ve learned what happens if you make fun of Klemmen, I don’t think you’ll do that again. Otherwise you could wind up standing like that again.” Klemmen did so much magic like that. We had some cows in Brandstrup who got sick in their knees and three died. But then we went to find Klemmen and he helped them. They were to have a pail of their own milk eight mornings in a row, and after that we didn’t have any that died. He could also cure those who were bewitched.
