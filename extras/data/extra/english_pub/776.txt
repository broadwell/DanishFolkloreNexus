Lamdrup cow pasture, Svindinge, was a big surplus area for common grazing for the Lamdrup townsmen one hundred years ago. Now it is partly wooded and partly cultivated. Back when the maids used to go out there to milk, there was a girl who once met a foreign man out there several times with whom she talked. It seemed odd to her and so she told the people at home about him. There was somebody who told her that the next time he came she should tell him to turn around. She did that, too, the next day and when she got to see his back, she discovered that his back looked like an alder stump. It was an elf whom she had come into contact with.
