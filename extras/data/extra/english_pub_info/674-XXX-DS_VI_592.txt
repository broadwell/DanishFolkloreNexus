A man in the farm in Nørup hanged himself and, after they had gotten him buried, there was nobody who would live in the farm, because every night as soon as the sun had gone down, a black dog came and just touched the door so that it sprung open. Then it ran through the house from one end to the other and knocked the doors open. It was as if the cattle knew when it came because they got restless as soon as it had knocked the door open. The cattle that were tied up in the barn tore at their bits and mooed as if they were completely crazy, and if any of them could tear themselves free, they would and run out of the farm. After a couple of nights like that, there was nobody who would stay there and those animals that weren’t moved died in the stalls. The man had said that the Evil One could come and get him; he was really bad about swearing in general. Therefore they believed that it was the Evil One who tumbled about in there. They had to tear the farm down and move it out onto the field, and since then they didn’t see anything more of the black dog.
