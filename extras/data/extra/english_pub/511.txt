At Galgebanke on Enner village commons, Tamdrup parish, there are still mound dwellers, and they hold a party every holiday evening and celebrate, and the mound rises up on tall pillars of fire and one can see the mound folk going in under the mound which is all lit up. They eat at long party tables and afterward they hold a dance.
