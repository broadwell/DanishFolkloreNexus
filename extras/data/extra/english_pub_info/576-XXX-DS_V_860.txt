There was always fun and games in the church in Lund in Sk√•ne, and the chairs lay about knocked over. The minister could not figure out what it could be, and wanted to discover what was doing it. Then there was a poor cobbler in the town, he offers him a big payment if he would go up there and stay the night. Well, the cobbler said he was willing to do that, but he wanted a candle with him, and then he wanted the minister to write the Lord's prayer in a big circle around him, and then he wasn't to leave the circle until the minister came and said, "Come now in Jesus Christ's name." He intended to sit inside the circle and cobble. As soon as he'd gotten into the church and started working, someone comes who looks like the minister. He says, "Come in name." No, he wouldn't go, because God's name hadn't been there. A little while later, so many came into the church, and there was a minister who went up to the pulpit. Now more ministers came up to the cobbler and said, "Come in name." He wouldn't leave the circle and stayed sitting there. Finally, they came and wanted to sell him a hide. Then he reaches out with his staff, they were to put the hide on that, and then he got it in to where he was. The next day, the minister came and said, "Come now in Jesus Christ's name." Now he wasn't scared of following him. Then he showed the minister the hide and it was that of a corpse. The hide was attached to the church door, and then the haunting stopped. But they couldn't totally rebuild the church anyway, there were some stones they couldn't get to lie correctly.
