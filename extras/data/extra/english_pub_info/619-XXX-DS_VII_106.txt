There was an old woman here in town who was called Lisbet and they accused her of being a witch. Then there was a place where the cows were being milked during the night. The people wanted to take care of them, but they couldn't do anything. Then one morning when the milkmaids were to go out and milk, they saw a hare that ran down through the ditch and disappeared, but what became of it, they didn't know. The girls got scared and thought that it was Lisbet. Now the old ones have said that if you see a hare like that and name it by name, then the witch will stand in front of you buck naked. But if you say the wrong name, it is very dangerous, because then they can bewitch you and turn you into a monster. That's why no one dared do it, but Lisbet seemed like a witch, since she was always so friendly and obsequious.
