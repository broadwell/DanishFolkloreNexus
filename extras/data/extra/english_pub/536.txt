A treasure is buried in the castle courtyard near Bellinge, but it's not easy to get ahold of, because from the moment one begins to dig for it and until one has got it home, one may not speak a word. Some men from the area once tried to dig it up, and they had also got hold of the kettle, which was filled with money, and they had gotten it up to the edge of the hole, which they had dug, but then one of them couldn’t stay quiet any longer because of his happiness over the unbelievable amount of money that there had to be in the kettle. “It’s tremendous how heavy this thing is!” he said, and as soon as that was said, the kettle fell away from them and sank far deeper than it had been before, and they had to go home with empty hands. People living now have seen lights burning on the castle courtyard, and since the light probably burns over the treasure, it should be possible to find it even now.
