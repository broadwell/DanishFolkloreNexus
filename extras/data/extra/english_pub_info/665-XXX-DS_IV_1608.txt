When thieves broke in at night, they had a “thief finger.” They’d take it from a thief in the gallows, and they could light it in their throats, when they put it down there. Then it would light up just like a candle and wherever it stood and burned, people couldn’t wake up there. They went over to them and said: “If you’re sleeping, then you’ll have time to sleep, but if you’re not asleep, then something bad will happen to you.” This happened one place, a thief broke in and came and said that. The man wasn’t sleeping, but he got so scared that he pretended to sleep and lay and watched as they took his money. The thief also had a big long knife lying on the table.
