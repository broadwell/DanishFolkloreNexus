A farmhand had caught a viper king and he had it boiled in a pot. But a boy licked the fat. Come out ... One pulling a cow, that had been to the bull. It didn't need to go there any more, since now it was carrying a black mottled calf.

Well, the boy didn't really want to admit it, but he had to, and now he had gotten the wisdom.
