There was a stone in Ugilt farm’s field, south of Ugilt church which was called Terkild’s stone. One year, the minister had a stone splitter splitting stones for him and then he came and said, “They’ve all been split except for Terkild’s stone.”—“Hm hm hm,” said the minister, “that stone is not to be split, let it be.”
