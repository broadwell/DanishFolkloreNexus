A Norwegian, who could chase rats away, came to Thisted and they wanted him to chase them away. He took on the job in return for a certain payment from each household. But there was one who wouldn't pay. Then the Norwegian called all the rats and drove them down into the Limfjord. But the man who didn't pay, he got to keep his rats, and they had lots of babies, and so they spread to the surrounding area once again. If that man had paid, then all of Thisted would have been free of rats.
