I went and was a shepherd in Fristrup enge, that was in the Stigborg meadows. There had once been a gate, but now there wasn’t, just a broken place that went through. At the time, I was still childish enough to go to the other boys and ask them what that blue light out there was. When I mentioned it to them, it went out, so I probably was not supposed to talk about it. There must have been money buried there, because it was a blue light, and when it’s blue, then it’s money.
