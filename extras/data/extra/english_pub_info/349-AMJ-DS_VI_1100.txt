Anders Væver had so many apples in his garden. He said that they couldn’t take a single one of them, and there was a big bet made, they wagered ten daler, and there were three men involved. The first was going to shake them down, the other one was going to chase away anyone who came by, and the third was going to gather them. Then they thought that they’d be able to get them. The first one got up into the apple tree and shook. A rooster came after him and pecked at his head so he didn’t manage to shake much down. A big calf came and swallowed the ones that had fallen down and it pushed the man off the road, so they couldn’t get any apples and he won the bet. When Anders Væver was dead, he went again up in the attic and measured grain and sat at the end of the table and counted his money. Then the minister had to go down there and conjure him.
