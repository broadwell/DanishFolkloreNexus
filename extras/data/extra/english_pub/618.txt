At a place over here in Handest, they'd gone down to Vindblæs and the cunning woman there to ask for advice about an illness. When they came home, they threw the prescription away. Then the hired girl was sitting outside in the evening milking and a piece of paper flew into the bucket, and it was the prescription. She hadn't been with them down there, so it was strange that it came to her.
      One time two doctors and the district bailiff came down to the woman in Vindblæs to arrest her. But she asked them to go home and delouse themselves. When they got home, they were so covered with lice that they had to go back to her to get rid of them.
