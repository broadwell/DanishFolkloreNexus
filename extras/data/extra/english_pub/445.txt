In Visby near Trøjborg there was a woman who many suspected of being a witch. Our neighbor claimed that he had started to believe this about her because of a game he had played with her. She came once, and when she was leaving, he said, “God be with you!” Then she came back again and couldn’t leave. Now they talked about inconsequential things and she left again, but he repeated the words from the first time and then she stood there again and had to turn around again. He did that three times, and three times she came back, but then he got sort of scared and the fourth time he said only goodbye so she could leave. They also say that two needles or pieces of straw placed in the shape of a cross on the threshold can work, and no witch can cross the threshold until they’re taken away. When this woman was dead, a person came and put a twelve shilling coin in the open mouth of the corpse which, on the day of burial, was gotten early and, green and horrid as it was, was to be put into moonshine, which a drunk was supposed to drink so he’d become disgusted with moonshine.
