The Boeslunde town nisse lived in the farm where Jens Jensen’s widow now lives. The man there always had these incredibly fat horses. They never fed at bedtime, the nisse was to take care of that. When the man was lacking hay, the nisse stole from Sønderup. One time, they saw a load of hay come driving along from Sønderup to Boeslunde, but there were no horses pulling it. The people who saw it let the wagon pass by since they knew well enough that it was the nisse who was driving. A little later, the wagon bolted into Toftegård.
