There was a tailor over in Voldum once, and he was at a farm in Alstrup sewing. Then some gypsies came, one was named Engel (Angel), and he was supposed to be the husband, and the other one was named Ingeborg. Then they say hello, and they asked for alms. While the wife was off getting it, the tailor says to them, “Where do you two come from?” – “What’s that?” they say. “I said, where do you go to church, where are you from?” – “What are you saying?” they say, “Let the red cock crow over you one day, little sheep (fåesen)! I wish you were in the millpond up to your head! I wish you sat howling on a rack, little sheep! I wish you were up on Blåksbjøre gagged and crushed!” At the same time, the farm wife comes in and she says, “What is that supposed to mean? On my blessed oath I want you out of here!” and she goes over and grabs a mangle roller, which was on a chest in the room, and she begins to beat them with it. Then they started telling her off again, but they left, and they lay down by the garden embankment and smoked tobacco, puffing away. When the farm wife sees this, she takes the mangle roller and goes in and brushes them with it again, because women in those days always used their mangle rollers, and then she drives them further away. When the farm wife comes inside, the tailor is curled up there shaking because he thought he was going to die.
