At the farm Urup, there was a count named Jørgen who owned seven manor farms besides Urup and, whenever he drove in formal finery, he had eight white mares before his carriage. The farm was stoutly built and there was a drawbridge leading over to it. The door posts and the knocker were made out of whalebone, and the windowsills were sculpted out of fine stone. But this Count Jørgen was a lecherous fellow, so to speak, and he kidnapped girls round about and he had one to lie with every night. Afterward, he would throw her out into the moat, and then she had to take care of herself, whether or not she could make it to land. Then he got to thinking that he wanted to get married and he marched on down to Venge farm; a rich woman lived there, she only had one daughter. He courted her, and he had his horses shod with gold horse shoes before he rode over there and there was a group of guys who followed along in procession. When he came to the farm, the woman was standing at the gate, so he told her his errand there on his horse. When he was finished, the woman answered: “No, my daughter is not going to have a lecherous fellow like you.” Then he threatened her but I can't remember how it turned out since I was only six years old when it was told to me. The woman got out of it by getting five manor lords from her kin to go after him, and gamble with him and they cheated him. He played with such ardor that he slammed the dice down on the table so it sang, but before it was day, both Urup and the seven estates were lost, and he became such a poor beggar that he went about begging until his death. This is supposed to have really happened.
