My grandmother lived in Jerslev. One night, before it had gotten dark, she had to run an errand south of Jerslev village, and there's quite a swamp there. She sees a really big horse and thinks it is her neighbor's, because they had one like that. But when she tries to shoo it off the road, and claps her hands at it, it turns into a really big herd of sheep. Then she felt the earth move under her like a sling, and then she ran home as fast as she could.
