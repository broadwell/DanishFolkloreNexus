My foster father said that there was an area for sacrifices on the flat part of the field on Svejstrup field, and from the time of his boyhood the stones were called Støønstæjet (Stævnestedet [the meeting place]). People used to meet there when they had something that they had to decide together. There were two stones on the sides, the stone in back went up with something like a backrest, and even the edge of it was very sharp. Then there were two on top of the side stones and there was an opening between them, and when they made a fire underneath them, the fire could burn up in between the stones and burn the person who was tied up on top, and the backrest was there to crush his back.
