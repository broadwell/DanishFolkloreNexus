Out in Ajt there are so many mounds, and among them is one called Kongehøj (King’s mound). They believed that there was a king buried there. Then the men from Ajt agreed to dig in the mound to see if they could find a treasure. They dug and all sorts of things appeared, first a dog, and he ran and hopped a long time, but they continued to dig. Finally, they got close to the treasure, and then a large red rooster came up. They had gotten ahold of the chest and were in the process of heaving it up out of the hole. The rooster ran about and did all sorts of tricks and then it let loose a huge fart. Then one of the men says: “That was one helluva fart for a rooster." Then it was over. People dug a bit in some mounds not too far from there, which are called Kløvnhøje, they thought that the rooster had run off over there with the treasure, and so they started there. But it was over, there was nothing to find.
