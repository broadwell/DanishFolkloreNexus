The minister was afraid of run away cows and he stood watching one that was acting up by the cemetery while he was throwing dirt on a casket. When he tosses the first shovelful on it, he says, “Now she’s putting her tail in the air.” At the second shovelful he says, “Now she’s starting to run,” and at the moment that the cow gets loose and runs away, he says with the third shovelful, “Now she journey’s off to Hell.” [“Now she takes off running like hellfire”]. It was the parish clerk’s cows who stood there by the cemetery.
