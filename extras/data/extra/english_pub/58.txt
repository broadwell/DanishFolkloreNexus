There was one from Jens Adals family, a witch rode on him to Trom’s church, it was the dean’s wife from Smorup (Ravnkilde parish). Then he talked to a witch master about this thing that had come and ridden on him one night and he thought that he was a horse. He’d gone past both Ålborg and Sundby and was so far away that he didn’t know how far it was. Well, the cunning man would give him some good advice for this. “When it is Voldborg eve again--some places they ride on Saint Hans eve as well--she’ll probably come like the last time and will want to ride on you, but you must not fall asleep.”--“Sure, but my whole body is so sore.” -- “Well, that’s because you’re troll-ridden.” And then he gave him something that was supposed to help. Well, then she came sure enough on Voldborg eve and put a bridle on him. But he was wide awake. She rode on him then to Troms Church and she tied him up there--or maybe she just let him go to take care of himself. The witch master had told him what would happen. Then he was supposed to push the bridle off of himself in the meantime and when she came out again, he was supposed to put it on her. Then she’d turn into a horse and he was to get up and ride her. Well, she did exactly what the witch master said she would. She went in along with the others and there were many of them. He stands there and pushes the bridle off and when she came out he put it on her. Then he rode home to where he came from and when it was day, he rode to Store-Arden and had her shod both front and back. When that was done, he took the bridle off of her and he saw that it was the dean’s wife, she stood there and had been shod on both her hands and feet and she stood shaking them. One time when he went to Brorstrup church to see her, he thanked her for their last meeting.
