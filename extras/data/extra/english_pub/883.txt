It was just before Christmas, a man went to Ålborg early one morning and came past a gallows where a thief hung. At night, when he went home, he had had a nice big dram and was a bit swollen with it. Then he yells up to the thief: “What are you hanging there and dangling for? It would be better if you came down and visited me Christmas eve.” He drives along and comes home to his bed. Then the alcohol starts to wear off and he says to his wife: “I think I made a mistake tonight.” “What was that?” she says. “When I drove past the gallows, I yelled out to the dead guy that he should come down and visit me Christmas eve.” “Well, you shouldn’t have done that, now we’ll see what happens.” Christmas eve comes and sure enough someone comes and knocks on the door. The man welcomes him and he’s supposed to sit at the end of the table, and there was a big meal set out for him. It looked like he ate, but he didn’t swallow any of it. When he was done, he thanked them and wanted to leave. “Well, now you’ll probably come up and visit me New Year’s eve,” he said. The man was a little spooked by the visit and he immediately says yes. Then he goes to the minister and wants to hear what the father will say about it and he tells him the whole story. The minister advises him that he should say, “I come in God’s name, and I will also leave in God’s name.” He plods up there New Year’s eve and when he hears a clink, his eyes change for him, and it's like he is in a really nice apartment. He says what he had decided on, though, that he comes etc. He’s served food and drink and then wants to go. But then the dead guy stops him and says, “Who taught you that? If you hadn’t said that, then I would’ve toyed with you, since you had no right to talk to me when you drove past.” Then there was a bang again and now he stood out by the gallows and then he sweated it home as fast as he could.
