There was a man who had some money, but it disappeared. So he went to a cunning man and wanted him to “show” the money again. He asked if he didn’t suspect any of his employees. Well, yes, he wasn’t without his suspicions. “Well, then I’ll come tomorrow at noon, and precisely at that time, you should gather all of your employees at lunch time.” So just as they were sitting there the next day, the man looks out into the courtyard and says, “OK, the cunning man is here now.” When he came in, he walked around and looked at them, and then he says to them that he is now going to cut a little stick of wood for each of them, and they need to take good care of them. And the stick of wood of the one who stole would be an inch longer than everyone else’s the next morning. Then the girl who’d taken the money thought to herself that she’d make sure that this was a lie. She took a measuring stick and measured an inch and cut that much off of her stick. The next morning, when they all brought their sticks out, hers was an inch shorter than the others. Then they could see who’d taken the money.
