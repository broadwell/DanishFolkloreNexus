A troll lived in a mound on Horns field, and he had a black cow which grazed with the cows of the farmer who lived near the mound. The boy who took care of the cows also had to take care of the troll’s cow but he also got paid for that because every day near the mound there was a plate of pancakes with a two shilling piece on top. Then one year the farmer got a boy who was a real bad guy. The first day he went out with the cows, the troll’s black cow also came along. The boy now went over to the mound to see if it was true what he’d heard that there was supposed to be a plate of pancakes with a two shilling piece on top. Well, sure enough it was true and the boy ate the pancakes and put the two shilling piece in his pocket. But then he unbuttoned his pants and did what he had to on the plate. From that day on, neither pancakes nor the two shilling piece appeared, but the black cow continued to appear, so the boy had to take care of the troll’s cow without any pay.
