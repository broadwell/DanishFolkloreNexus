In Vissing woods there was a place where the child had been switched, and they got a changeling instead which had an unusual way of holding its eyes, it kept its eyes fixed all the time. It also had an unusually large head, but otherwise it looked like a baby. They didn’t know what to do. Then someone came along and taught them that they should make some nice pancakes and use eggs to make them, but every time they broke an egg, they should throw the shell at the baby’s head, because the trolls were invisibly present and when they saw that, they’d think that it didn’t get anything else. A little time passed and then the trolls came with their child and threw it in the crib and took the changeling with these words, “I never would have thought that egg shells were good to eat.” Then it left. Just to make sure that it wouldn’t happen again, they sewed a cross on all of the clothing the baby wore and then the baby was baptized.
