There was a man down in Jerup, he’d been in the navy for fifteen years in the old war, and he told about a strange thing that had happened on the ship. They’d had quiet weather for four days and couldn’t sail, and so the three hundred men who were on board decided that, to amuse themselves and to pass the time, they should try what it was like to hang themselves. They were hung up, one after the other, and then the one who was up was supposed to put his finger in the air when he didn’t want to hang any longer. Then there was an old sailor, he was sixty years old, and he didn’t want to try this because he thought it was silly. They’d all tried it, but he wouldn’t. Then the crew goes up on deck and they’re missing the old guy. So they wanted to go back down to get him and they get down below decks but they can’t get into the room where they’d tried the hanging because the door was locked and they couldn’t open it. Then the ship’s captain comes along and says, “Smash open the door!” Then they smashed the door to pieces and when they get in there, the old guy is hanging up in the noose and there’s a black cat sitting on his head. Then it got up and went up on deck and out into the sea. They didn’t have any cats on board so they were totally puzzled by that sight. Then they cut the old guy down and he see,ed to be dead but the doctor managed to bring him back to life. When he came to he told them that when the others had gone up, he decided to try it, but as soon as he’d gotten his chin in the noose, it was as if a barrel of grain had been put on his head, and then he didn’t remember a thing. If they hadn’t come in and smashed the door down, then he’d never have survived. The man from Jerup saw the whole thing and swore that this was true. My father worked at the farm with him and he told him about it. He could get so mad when people didn’t believe his stories.
