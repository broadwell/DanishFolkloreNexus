…. The hired boy goes out to the mound man: “Good day.” -- “Yes, thank you.” -- “What’s going on today little guy?” So he tells him … Well, he was so scared of Tordenfåer and Mütter Maria. ….  Now everybody wanted that boy to work for them, but he said that it wouldn’t do any good, because then the mound man wouldn’t recognize him if he went out on a different field. There was probably something to that, and so he continued on with that man and they got along so well that he inherited the farm from him.
