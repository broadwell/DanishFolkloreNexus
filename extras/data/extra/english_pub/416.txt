My father's parents separated and then my father went to live with an old man who wasn't married and who wandered about and played (music). My father often lay alone in the house. One night after heâ€™d gone to bed and it was a clear moonlit night, he couldn't fall asleep and then a big black shaggy dog came in to him, he could clearly see everything in the room. The door sprang open when it came in and it went over to the fireplace, it was an open wood-burning stove, where it began to stand and puff and blow in the ashes, so smoke swirled about the room. He got under his comforter and when he looked up again, the dog was gone.
