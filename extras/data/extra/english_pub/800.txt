They tell that in Ulvborg parish and several other places in west Jutland that the plague came floating like a big black cloud one day when the people stood outside of the church. In Rødding in Salling they say that one day the people had come out of Krejbjærg church, and they saw a large cloud come floating in. The minister, who was supposed to be the same Rødding minister about whom so much was told and who saved the Randers minister from the Evil one, said that it was the plague that was coming, "but now we should all go into the church and pray that it won’t come to us." So they did that and that’s what happened since nobody from Rødding and Krejbjærg parishes died of the plague.
