North and east of Sofiendal, up there where Old Farm now is, and nearby the lake that they called Pitte Lake, which is dried up now, there was a farm which was called Gravold, and you’re supposed to still be able to see its ruins. According to old talk, this farm was owned by this Ranild Jønson we’ve heard quite a bit about. On the southern side of Mos Lake there was another manor farm, and these two farms were decimated at the same time. They say that the two manor lords feuded with each other, and so they each decided to burn the other one's farm. It was to happen Christmas eve, since at that time the farms were guarded the least, because people sat about drinking and enjoying themselves and it was kind of strange that these two made the same decision to attack on the same night, and then they went off and met up, each coming from their own way around Mos Lake down here at Fuldbro mill. They didn’t recognize each other and continued on their way and also were lucky enough to set each others farm on fire. Now when they each got home to their own place, their farms lay in ashes. Since that time both Gravold and the other farm have been deserted.
