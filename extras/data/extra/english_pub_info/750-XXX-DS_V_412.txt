Once there was a dead person buried east of Klemmensgård in Bratten. The dead one was probably really predisposed to drink since every year when they brewed Christmas beer in Klemmensgård something always went wrong, either the bottom fell out of the tub or the tap came off the keg or the keg bands burst and the beer spilled and the dead person was blamed for that. But the corpse was dug up and they haven’t lost any beer since then.
