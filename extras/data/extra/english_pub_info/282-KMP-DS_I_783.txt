A farmhand came riding past a mound on Tendrup field once, they call it Hvonbjærg. Then a fine lady came running down from the mound and asked him to hold a glass while she poured him a snaps. He stopped and he took the gold cup from her but instead of drinking it, he threw it behind himself, and a couple of drops landed on the horse, it took all the skin off of the horse in those places. But he held onto the drinking horn and took off as fast as he could, right across the fields, and she set off after him and asked him to ride on the hard and not on the plowed fields because she had to go along the road and couldn’t run on the plowed land. She ran with a large handful of dirt and after she’d come a ways she threw it and then she turned around and went back. A large mound appeared there where she’d thrown the clump of dirt and they call it Vendingshøj. But the farmhand brought the horn here to Hornslet and they say that the church was built with the horn, that’s why it was called Hornslet, before that it was just called Slææt. Now they call the mound Hænildshøj, but it is Vændildshøj, because that’s where she turned around, and it lies in between Hornslet and the forest.
