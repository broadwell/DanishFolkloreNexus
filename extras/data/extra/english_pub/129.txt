On Højbro in Copenhagen. A farmhand from Jutland had dreamed. He traveled over (to Copenhagen) and walked around for one day and another. “What are you looking for? You’ve been walking around here for a couple of days.” “Oh, I had a dream, but to hell with it.” “Well, what did you dream...” “Well, there’s a kettle full of money on Trondals Mark” (west of here). But I don’t know where either Trondal or Trondals Mark is. But the other one knew and then he found his fortune. Went home, dug up the kettle and found the fortune.
