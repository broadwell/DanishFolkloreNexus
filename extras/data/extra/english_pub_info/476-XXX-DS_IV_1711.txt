During the black death, all of the people in Øster-Løgum parish died except for three young men who had walled themselves into a vaulted door in the farm which is now owned by Nis Madsen in Havslund. They had brought food and water along for six months. But every eight days they went outside of the house and raised a piece of fresh meat up on a long pole. It hung there until they came again and then it was taken down. For a long time, it was completely rotten and black when it came down, and that was a sign that the plague was still in the air. It continued like that until the meat was fresh when they took it down again because then there was no longer any danger. Then they said to each other: "Now we’ll go and see to our neighbors." At that time there were twelve farms just like now. But they went from house to house and found only dead people and animals. They wandered from village to village like this in the whole parish. People lay dead in the fields by plows and gates, and there was nothing else alive except for eagles and beasts of prey. Houses stood empty for twenty-five to thirty years after that. A minister was brought out from Åbenrå to the church, and he said a prayer of thanksgiving for the end of the plague.
