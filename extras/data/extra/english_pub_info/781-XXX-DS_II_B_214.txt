In Kristen Madsen’s farm in Vejlby, nissebuk has always had his place. When the boys didn’t tease him too much, he was very accommodating and wouldn’t harm a cat. If the man came home really late from the market, he could freely toss the reins, nis would unharness the horses. Out of thanks the wife gave him a new fur for the winter, but since then nis would never unharness the horses, and when Kristen Madsen yelled at him, he said: “Do you think I want to dirty my new clothes?”
