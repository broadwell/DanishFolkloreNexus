Pastor Åboe in Kragelund believed quite a bit in the cunning folk. As soon as one of his animals got sick, he sent for the cunning woman who lived in town and she could read over it and bless it. A minister in Gjødvad didn't think that way, because one day when he wasn't home and a cow got sick, his people sent for the cunning woman, and the cow got better, but when he heard that, he said: I would have rather lost the cow than have it cured that way.
