There was a little house in the most western part of Tårs on the southern side of Amdal; there was a barn at the western end and everyone who’d lived there knew that on the north and south sides of the barn there were two holes. They could wall them over as often as they liked, they were always there. There was also quite a row there in the barn. They thought it was a sow with a terribly long chain that went through there since that sow went through the dale and continued on to Hvidstedgård’s field to a stone wall where it disappeared. Many have seen that sow, and it was supposed to be a really huge sow, but nobody knew anything else about it.
