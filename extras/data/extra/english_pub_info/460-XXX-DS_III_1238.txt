Up between the Hammer hills in Hammer parish there is a big swamp covered with a thin layer of grass, but there is no bottom to be found for the first forty feet. A farm was supposed to have lain there once, the owner of which had played a joke on the minister the same way as so many other places. He drove himself there, and he drove himself from there, but when he got a little bit away from the farm, he asked the driver if he could see it. He answered that he could just see the chimneys, and little later he couldn't see anything at all.
