Wedding vows: Just as the hoopoe with its beautiful crown or the peacock with its gilded feathers and spotted legs, that is exactly how your hastily dolled up bride and groom appear to me today. Love burns in my heart for her, just like the cat when he sees a sausage, or the fox when he sees a sour cheese or a gray goose in his eyes, or in front of his eyes, you, the most beautiful among mankind’s daughters. But I am afraid that he will say, just as Moses says it in the fifth, backwards in the twenty-eighth, “You shall take wife, but others shall sleep with her.” Those are the words of the text. And so I ask you, you honorless and greatly scorned young man Mikkel Husløs, if you have asked counsel of your family, friends, the toll taker in Viborg or the police commander in Ålborg whether you should take the honorless and greatly scorned young woman Sidsel Sluwp who stands by your side? Then give each other your feet. – I ask you to keep your marriage so that it is not with you like the sow that walks on the street: when you scratch her underbelly, she lies down, or like the gray mare who stands on the hill, when she’s eaten her stomach full, she shits a trough full. But you should be wild and crazy, quick and snappy, bite and scratch about yourselves, then your sins will fall from you like cow shit tumbles off of high mountains.
It was written in St. Paul’s epistle to the Romans, that toll, just as in your mother’s skirt in the third wrinkle from her bum. Amen!
