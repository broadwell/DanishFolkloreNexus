It was out in Jerup in Elling parish, they couldn't get salt in the old war of 1801, and so they cooked salt from seaweed. There was a farmhand who took care of the saltworks, my father had seen that saltworks many times. Then there was a mermaid who'd come ashore to warm herself by this kettle and she came every day for a quite a while. Finally, the farmhand got angry and took a bucket of boiling hot salt brine and throws it at her. Then she screams and she darts out into the water, "Pilvakker, Pilvakker, Skriven has been scalded." Then the merman came out of the ocean so the water boiled around him and he went up there to the saltworks and smashed the wood and everything else like it was sewing thread and tore the whole building down. The farmhand ran off and they never did build it up again. Pieces of the building lay out there at that place where it had been when he went to the minister out there. Compare to Andersen.
