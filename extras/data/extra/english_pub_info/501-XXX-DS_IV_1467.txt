Jens Langkniv (Longknife) lived in Hvivelstov mound west of Navtrup church. There was a road from the sound up to Navtrup and then on to the east, and he plundered those who traveled this road. He had threads over the road, and bells down in the mound that rang. He and his assistants went in and stole things up here in Navtrup. He was so strong that he could pick up a tree that they used to block the entrance on the cave, and in that way there would be an opening so the others could crawl out and take what they wanted. One time one of them got crushed between the side wall and the tree and lay stuck there.
