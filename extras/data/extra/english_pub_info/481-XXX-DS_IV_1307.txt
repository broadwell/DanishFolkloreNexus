It was so overgrown with woods in Nørre-Hjarup that when there was going to be a wedding, two young men had to go ahead and cut down branches so that they wouldn’t take the bride’s crown off, and when they came to a clearing, which is still today called Skovende (end of the woods), they had to stop and wait for the bride to come. Øster-Løgum town wasn’t as pretty then as it is now. One time it happened at a wedding in Hjarup that one of the young men who was supposed to go ahead like that had been engaged with the bride first and when the couple had been married and they were driving back, the two young men jumped up on the back of the wedding carriage and drove with them home to the wedding farm. When the guests were done eating, the dancing as usual began upstairs. Then the bridegroom came forward and said, “Each and everyone from the whole town is welcome in my house and gets free food and drink except for Tagefæl, he can’t come along.” The bridegroom had just said these words when the young man who had been the lover of the bride before comes flying in with an axe in his hand and cleaves the bridegroom’s forehead, and at the same time grabs the bride and runs with her down to Hjarup river to the pool, which is still called Semphøl after the murderer, he was an immigrant German and was called Semptafel. The pool is twenty-four feet deep, and they both drowned there.
