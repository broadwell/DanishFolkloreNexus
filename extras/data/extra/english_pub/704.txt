A farmer in Dybbøl was really friendly with a group of small nisser, who lived nearby, and they constantly brought so much to the farm that there was great wealth there. When the man died, a little nisse came one day to the son and asked if he wanted to have the same arrangement that his father had. The son wouldn’t answer that unless the nisse could tell him where his father was. The nisse could answer that well enough, his father was with them. “No,” said the son, “then I don’t want to have anything to do with you.” But now the nisse said: Well, well if you don’t want that, then he’d also have to accept that they took everything away again which they had brought to his father in his time. The son asked them not to do it all at once, but little by little. The nisse promised to do this for his father’s sake. After that time, there was great poverty at the farm, and it has been like that ever since.
