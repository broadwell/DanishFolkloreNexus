Pastor Trap lived at Hvidstedgård and owned it and he also owned Spangerhede and Mølgård along with its large landholding and Ugiltgård and the parsonage. He was a member of the konsistorium and was a Freemason. They could see him come driving from the farm and down to Spangerhede and when they got to the farm he was home nonetheless. His grave is under the alter in Tårs in a walled crypt. A carpenter and a mason were supposed to build the crypt and they worked on it. Then the minister comes in and wants to see how it's going. He laid his arms on his knees before the altar and he cried so much that his shirt sleeves got wet. He asked them to hurry up with the crypt. Then Mason Jens says, “But Father is a healthy and lively man still, he could live for many more years.” To that the minister answered: “Well, the grave is ready as soon as the corpse is ready.” It was too, he died suddenly in 1804.
