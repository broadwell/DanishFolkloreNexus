Svend Felding was born at Åkjær and continued to live there as an adult, and he was so good at building that the elves wanted him. Late one evening, when he was riding home, two elf girls come to him and one of them sang for him and the other one asked him to drink from a chalice. Then she says to him that he could have a wish and as soon as he’d emptied the chalice it would be granted. So he wished that he could have the strength of twelve farmhands and then he took the chalice and threw the drink over his back, and where it landed on the horse, it lost all of its hair and everything. Then he rode directly across a newly plowed field, and the elves couldn’t follow him there. He got away that way. But the elves tricked him anyway, because there was the problem that he’d forgotten to mention eating. Now that he had the strength of twelve farmhands, he also needed to eat for twelve farmhands. The breakfast bowl that he used to get his food in used to be kept at Åkjær and it was called Svend Felding’s breakfast bowl.
