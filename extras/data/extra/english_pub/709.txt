A man who worked at Voermark told me the following: When I worked there, we always had misfortune with our calves; after they had grown a bit, they would often be lying dead in their stalls the next morning. We got the cunning man from Frørup; he come one evening when it was really dark and rainy. I offered to follow him out there and around with a lantern, he was supposed to put something under each threshold where there were animals; but he didn't want me along, he went out alone. When he was done, I was to drive him to Frørup; I didn't want to since it was so dark. I told him that he could stay until the next day. He answered no. "If I am not out of the farm by twelve o'clock, things will go wrong." I had to leave with him; but after that time, our calves did well. He had forgotten a place though, and that was the sheep house, and so now it affected the lambs, until we moved that house, and then everything was OK.
