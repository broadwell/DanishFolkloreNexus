A man was offered fifteen bushels of oats to stay the night over in a church. The man wanted to earn the oats so he let himself be locked in the church where he immediately went and sat down beneath the church bell. At midnight, someone came and said: "If you hadn't sat down beneath the holy God's ding dang, I would have plucked you as small as cat hairs."
