They had many oxen at Baggesvogn. One winter, half of them died and then the countess thought that there was someone who had bewitched them. There was a hag on the estate they called Bragholdt's hag, she lived in Bragholdt and was a real witch and had Cyprianus. The countess borrows these books from her. Then an ox was slaughtered and many spells were cast. The countess had two hags with her that night in the room where they cast spells with the ox. They call the Devil in to them, he was to tell them who had cursed the oxen. But then they don't really know how they should speak to him and so it happened that the three women were torn apart into small stumps. In the morning they lay in there, both the countess and the two hags, and their blood was spattered about on the walls. That was in 1808. My father remembered it as a child. One of the hags had a son who worked at the farm as an ox handler. Just as it happened, three slashes appeared in the comforter over him, so it was just like it was going to tear it into three pieces. If the Bragholdt hag had also been there, then it would have gone well because she knew the spells really well.
