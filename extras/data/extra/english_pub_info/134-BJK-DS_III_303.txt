On Årestrup field northwest of the church there’s a rune stone, it's in the third field south of Bavnhøj, that’s what my mother said, she was born in 1792 and she wasn’t more than a little girl when they found it. It was after the fields had been reapportioned and her father plowed into it. Then he got his farmhand out there to help him dig a ditch around it, but it was so big that four horses couldn’t pull it up, and he had four good horses too and really wanted to bring it back to the farm, it could have closed up a big part of the stone wall around the farm. But when he realizes that it's too big to freight it off, they decide to bury it. Then they had to dig a hole below it that it was big enough for them to push it in, and it had to be deep enough that they could plow over it; that wasn’t too hard because it turned out there was some beautiful white sand there that was easy to dig. There was some heather near Bavnhøj at that time, and it was starting to break up when my father ran into it. When the farmhand had gotten it dug out there were all sorts of raised letters on it, they weren’t carved into it, more like they’d been glued onto it. It was probably a stone that had stood over on Bavnhøj in the old days. But it isn’t so easy to find it again, because the fields have been turned completely around since that time.
