A farmer on Bornholm was a Freemason, and so the Devil was supposed to get him--because he is supposed to get all Freemasons. When he went to communion, he didn't take bread or wine. When he was dead and was to be buried and they brought his corpse to the church, the lid of the casket burst open and there was nothing in there but a black ox hide. The Devil had taken him.
