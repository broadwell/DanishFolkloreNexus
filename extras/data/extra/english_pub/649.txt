A manor lord lived at the manor Skovsbo, and he was in league with the Devil. One Sunday morning, while the lady was at church, he asked his servant to go out and look and see if a small black cloud wasn't approaching on the horizon. The servant went out, but came back and said there weren't any clouds to see. A little later, the manor lord asked him to go out again, and this time the servant reported that there was a strange black cloud rising over the manor. "Well," said the manor lord, "go up to your room and stay there until the lady returns from church." The servant went, but a moment later he heard a commotion from the manor lord's chamber. Curious, he tiptoed out to the hall and the master's door. It was locked, and when he wanted to bend down and look through the keyhole, he got his eye poked out. Horrified, he ran down the stairs to yell for help, but he became even more horrified when he saw his master's right hand lying on the stairs. The people who came streaming to the house broke open the door to the fateful room. It was empty, but on the floor were large puddles of the manor lord's blood, and the walls and the ceiling were covered with bright blood red splashes. The manor lord was gone, but the Devil couldn't take his right hand, since that had been given away at the altar.
