There was a farmhand who worked for a farmer, but if it was in Hvilshøj or in Kraghede, I can’t say. The man was a bad one to drink. One day he wanted to go to Sundby with grain, and the farmhand was supposed to come along. Then he drank too much and the farmhand had to drive the wagon home, but the man lay in the back and was drunk. When they got to Jerslev bridge near Hvilshøj and the farmhand looks down into the river, there is a woman who stood and swirled about in the water with her arm. “What the hell is this?” says the farmhand. Then she gets up and runs over and jumps up on one of the jades, and then it’s a runaway horse. The next day they went out and then they found a child that had been drowned. That woman had probably drowned the child and then drowned herself afterward. But there is nothing told about that. I think it was a portent that the child was to be found. It’s supposed to be a true story.
