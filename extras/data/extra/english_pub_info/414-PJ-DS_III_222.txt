There was a stone in Svejstrup, and there was a hand print in it, it looked like the hand had been pressed way down into it, and the stone is still there now. It was a troll over on Boes field who didnâ€™t like the Dover church bells, he thought they rang too loudly, and so he took a stone and threw it at them, but it barely made it half way.
