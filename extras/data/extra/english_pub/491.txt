Sometimes, early in the spring, one can see a whole lot of grass snakes hanging along the fences, there can be several hundred. They are seeking advice, the king grass snake sits right in the middle of them, but it isn't too easy to see him. But whoever could kill him and eat the fat, he would become very rich and wise. A boy by the name of Anders went around asking for a little bit of food, and came through the forest where a king grass snake lived. He didn't think about it, but cut himself a hazel switch to support himself, and went on his way. One day he came to a wise minister who asked where he'd gotten the switch. He told him. The minister offered that he could stay there and get good food and a warm bed to sleep in at night if he'd show him the place. The boy promised he would, and the next day they went there. The minister told him that he should go home now, because now he could handle it alone. After that, he led the king snake up, and he carried it home and cooked it in a big pot. The next day, the boy came out to the kitchen where the pot stood, and he wasn't hungry, but since there was a bread crust on the table, he took it and dipped it in the fat that was floating on top, and ate it. At that moment the minister came and chased him out of the door. "Things were good for you," he said, "but now you took what I wanted, so now you can get lost, now you've also become more wise than me." The boy became so unreasonably wise and rich as well, so he traveled up to the forest's edge and bought himself a farm that was called Brodgård, and there was a lot of talk about this Anders Brodgård.
