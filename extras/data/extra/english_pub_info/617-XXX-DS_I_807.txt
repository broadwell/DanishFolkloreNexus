Every Christmas eve, the so-called Firh√∏j in Karlslunde parish stood on four red poles. The town's farmhands agreed that one of them should ride out to the mound, and he was given the fastest horse to ride. There was both music and dancing, and a troll came out with a large silver cup in his hands. The farmhand threw the wine away, but a drop fell on the horse's rump and burned both hair and hide away. He spurred the horse on, but the troll shouted, "Ride on the field up to the hillock!" When the troll reached the plowed field, he had to run back and forth as many times as the plow had gone there. When he got close to the church where the other farmhands were waiting for him, he shouted, "Open the church door!" Then he got in on consecrated ground. The troll threw his axe so far into the cemetery wall that it split, but he couldn't go any further. That cup is still there at Karlslunde church.
