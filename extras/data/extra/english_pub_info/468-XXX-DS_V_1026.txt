One morning, I was standing in the kitchen in the Brovst parsonage baking muffins when I saw a woman in a red knit sweater with a large funny hat and a large checked apron on standing outside the window. So I get scared and tear off into the dining room. The old woman who was supposed to help me out had to go get the baking forms for me since I didnâ€™t dare. As soon as I came out to the kitchen, she was standing outside the window again. The madam had seen her the night before up in a long corridor and she thought that it was her sister.
