Wanderers always stayed at the farm where my mother was born, which was a like an informal inn, and they always bought themselves a half pint there. Once they were cooking apple soup, and they were doing this out in the barn, where they’d lit fire to some hay without worrying about how dangerous this was. But it never burned for that kind of people anyway. One of them was making the soup and the other one had been away to buy himself a half pint. Then the first one says, “Hey, give me taste a bit of your half pint, then I’ll give you some of my apple soup.” And he got permission, but then he drank the entire cup, and the other one started shouting at him about this. Then he says, “Shh! Be quiet. You can have all of my apple soup.” Then they came to blows with each other and beat each other bloody. My mother saw that fight.
