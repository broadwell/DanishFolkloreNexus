Many years ago, some people sat about and amused themselves by telling stories about all sorts of things. One of them fished a lot in the river, and he told this: “A couple of days ago, while I was drifting about in my boat and was poling myself along, I found something in the water which on closer inspection I discovered to be an iron-clad chest — like you know when you were along,” he said to his neighbor. “But we couldn’t get it up that time, and so today we decided to give it a try." Another man listened to the fisherman’s story with indifference. “Hmm...” he said, “it probably was nothing more than a big stone or the like.” In the meantime, he researched exactly where the place was. The teller, who regretted his indiscretion, set out to get the chest up the next day, but everything had happened the night before. They were all from Brede, and they found out that the old coins that were found had been exchanged in Copenhagen. One could trace wealth in that family since then.
