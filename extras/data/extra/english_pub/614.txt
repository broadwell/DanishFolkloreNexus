Once there was a sailor from Borre who was out sailing near Søbjærg. He found a big glove there, which he took and had its pair made in Borre, and he put them both down where he had found the first one. A little while later, when he sailed from Borre, he heard a loud voice yell when he came past Søbjærg:
"Listen, my glove friend, 
put your skiff in at Borre,
since Tolk is shivering 
and the oaks in Norway are creaking." 
The skipper lay in at Borre again and immediately after a storm came up, and no one had ever seen anything like it, and all of the ships that were out at sea were destroyed.
      Borre is a town on Møen to which people sailed in the old days. Søbjærg was at the time a mound out in the lake, but now it is surrounded by meadow. It is between Sømose and Klinten. "Tolk" is the name of the water in Grönsund (Green Sound); it predicts bad weather for the people of Møen. This was told by Kirsten Andersdatter from Borre who learned it from her father.
