For many years at certain times, a land surveyor went again in Jebj√¶rg heath. He went and shouted, "Where should I put one, and where should I put the other?" Then there was a boy who heard this and he said: "Put it where you took it, in the name of the Devil!" -- "I should have gotten that answer many years ago, then I would have been saved."
