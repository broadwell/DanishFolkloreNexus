The minister in Rold wrote over his door that he lived without sorrow or adversity. One time, the king came through there and when he saw that inscription he said to the minister that he was to come to an audience with him and answer three questions, otherwise, if he couldn’t, he was to kiss the blue virgin. The first question was what the king’s chair was worth, the second, what he himself was worth, and the third, what he was thinking. The minister was quite surprised by this and went about and was only half a person with worry. But then he falls into conversation with the town shepherd who said that if the minister would give him some new clothes and some traveling money, then he’d travel over to Copenhagen and meet with the king in his stead. Yes, he’d gladly do that and then the shepherd journeyed off. When he comes in to the king, he is sitting on a gold chair. The king asks him first what the chair is worth. “Oh, it isn’t worth more than what a good May rain can pay,” says the shepherd. “Well then what am I worth?” – “Yes, they gave 30 silver coins for our savior, so if you give twenty-nine for your majesty, then you’ve been well paid for.” – “OK, then what am I thinking about?”—“Yes, the king is thinking that you’re talking to Rold Minister, but in fact it is their town shepherd.” That’s how he got out of it well.
