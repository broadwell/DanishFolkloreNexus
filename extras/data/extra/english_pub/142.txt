A minister in Harridslev who was called Rafn sold grain to poor people and he always said when he measured the first scoop: “We won’t count that.” Then a man came and wanted to get some grain from him. When he’d said the usual, “I won’t count that,” the man answered, “For that Father should have lots of thanks” and then he went off with it. When he came back later and wanted some more grain, the minister said, as he measured the first scoop, “We’ll say two.”
