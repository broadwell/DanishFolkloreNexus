There's a story about a minister on Bornholm who, one night, when he was driving home past the cemetery, noticed that things weren't quite right in there. He told his coachman to stop while he went in there, and he said that if he didn't come back before the lantern they had with them burned out, he should drive, since he wouldn't be coming back ever again. The coachman did as he was asked, but he saw a terrible sight there in the cemetery. He could see the minister standing there conjuring someone down, who was standing on the bottom of a barrel, and fire was all around them. Later, when the lantern was just about to go out, the minister came running with his tongue hanging out and they drove home. The same story is told about another minister with the one difference that he put a candle in his room and said that if he didn't come back before it burned out then he'd never come back again.
