Near Sorø, a man went and plowed over his mound. He was somewhat surprised by a path which he’d never seen before that went from the mound down to his house; but then he found a glove which was so big that the fingers could hold a barrel of seed, and the farm was going insolvent at the time. The man took the glove home that night. But at night a voice came from outside the window and said: “Gloves and friend, give me my glove again! Otherwise two of your horses, the biggest and best, will lie dead tomorrow out in the swamp.” The man hung the glove out on the end of a beam and a little later it was torn away so hard that the house almost tipped over. But after that time everything prospered on the farm.
