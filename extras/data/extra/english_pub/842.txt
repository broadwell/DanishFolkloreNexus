A man told me himself that it was a clear moonlit night about midnight, he was walking along the road to Tyregod church. A little bit away from the church, he saw something walking towards him in the middle of the road, and he thought it was a big dog, but when he got closer to it, it looked a lot like a gray sheep. He moved to the side of the road and it walked quickly down the middle of the street right past him, and he could clearly see that it had red eyes which were glowing. He got a little hot around the ears, even though it didnâ€™t do anything to him, but he continued along the way to Hindskov. Others are also supposed to have seen that figure like a sheep.
