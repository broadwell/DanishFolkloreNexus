There was a little manor farm near Æbletoft, which was called Bogensholm, and there was a man who was invited there, he was called Count-Niels. He was from Æbletoft and he was supposed to be there as a fool or as a buffoon at a party. So they were sitting there and had some punch, and somehow or other they wind up discussing that he should buy the farm for a pittance. And so he wants it written down, but they didn’t have any paper close at hand. “We can write it on a piece of rolling paper,” he says. The next day he went to an attorney and showed it to him. “Yes, we can certainly use this.” Then he got the farm and later wound up owning a large part of Æbletoft.
