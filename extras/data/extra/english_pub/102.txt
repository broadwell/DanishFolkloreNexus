When their grain had ripened, they were supposed to send a message to the manor lord to come and get his tithe, and then the tithe taker would come and get it in the fields. But Kræn Hyldgård from Årestrup wouldn’t wait for this, he brought his grain whenever he wanted. Then he got a message from Mrs. Björn that he should go down to Buderupholm as she wanted to talk to him. “How is it, little Kræsten, that I don’t get any tithe from thee?” – She always used “thee” when speaking to the peasants. He shrugged his shoulders. “OK, well then I’ll send my wagon down to get it.” – “No, it’s a goddamn shame to send a horse and wagon after it,” answered Kræsten, “I’ll just put a rope around it and tie it to my back and carry it down here to the Mrs.” – “Don’t you have more grain than that little Kræsten?” – No, then he swore, he didn’t. “Well, keep it then.” After that he never paid tithe again. That was an easy way to get out of it, because what he said wasn’t in fact true.
