There was a minister in Mosbjærg, every night he went for a walk in the cemetery, and his wife questioned him about this. Well, there could be a soul that he could save from damnation, he says, and get it to confess. It was every night, whether it was raining, snowing or windy, it didn’t matter, and she was annoyed by this. Then she gets the coachman to put a white sheet over himself one night—my grandfather knew both the farmhand and the minister—and he runs ahead of the minister and goes out into the cemetery and runs in front of him from one grave to the next pretending to be a ghost. After the priest had gone and looked at this for a while, he says, “If you’re a person, then speak, but if you’re Satan, then get out of the way!” The farmhand doesn’t answer. He says this three times, and then he starts to read and is going to conjure him. Then the coachman shouts and says, “Father, Father, it's me.” – “God save me,” says the minister, “even if you were my own brother, I couldn’t save you.” When he’d sunk into the ground up to his ankles, he goes over to the parish clerk and he gets the keys and they go into the church and get the wine and bread and give it to the coachman, and then he conjured him all the way down. When the minister’s wife learned of this, she lost her mind.
