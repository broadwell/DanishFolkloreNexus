A farmhand served in a farm in Dronninglund, and he was there for three years. Every time he was out and came home at night, he saw a light out on their garden wall. So one winter they had finished threshing early and didn’t have anything to do. The son in the farm said to the farmhand: “Can you go out and dig up the garden wall." So he took a shovel and went out there and began to dig peat at the foot of the wall. Just when he dug up a peat divot, some big shillings tumbled out of the peat. He looked a bit closer and found some thirty and something. Then he went in and told the widow that. “Ahh,” she says, “now it’s been discovered. My husband lost a leather purse with sixty daler in it, and he was never able to find it. He looked in the feed bins, in the compost heap, in the outhouses, since he thought he had lost it in one of those places." But the farm hand never saw the light again. It was odd that they never found any more of the money. One has no idea how the money came to lie out by the garden wall but the man most likely was out there for a call of nature.
