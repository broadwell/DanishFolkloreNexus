The old counselor from Skårupgård came riding with four headless horses to Todbjærg church. He always came out of the northern door, and there by the door was a stall, they could never keep that stall door closed. They had a farmhand who closed it and after that it sprang open. But one night, after he’d gone to bed, something came after him and it lifted his bed straight up to the rafters and crushed him quite hard. Then the farmhand shouted and asked them to stop lifting him up there. “No, you’ve tormented us, but now you’ll die before we die.” Then the farmhand was crushed to death because he wanted to close the door and then they never tried to close it again.
