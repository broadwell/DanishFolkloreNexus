When the bishop of Børglum had banished Hvidbjærg church, some say for seven years, others for eight years, they were to bury a person alive to get the banishment lifted. Then a boy was bought from a poor woman and they gave him a nice sandwich and some shillings to go up and see how big the pit was. They had made the proper arrangement with the people who were digging it, and when he came, they pushed him in and started filling it up. The last thing they heard from him was, "You're making my sandwich dirty! You're making my sandwich dirty!" It's said that the two men were never quite all there ever again, and for several years one could hear the boy's cries at night.
