Out in Dalby field, west of the town, there's a mound called Elnebj√¶rg; it isn't tall but it is long, and stretches to the south and north. They say that two women stood up there and had a contest to see who could throw a stone the furthest. The one stone can be found out in a man's field in Dalby, the other in a field; that stone has been brought into town and put into a stone wall. In each of these stones there are five holes, like the tips of large fingers, though not very deep.
