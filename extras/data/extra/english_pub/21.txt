There’s a stone on Kirketange, south of Årestrup, and a giant stood on Rævild mound and wanted to knock Årestrup church down with it while people were in the church. It must have made a huge racket, and he must have had some strength in his fingers, because they left marks in the stone. He must have really used a lot of his strength when he threw it, because it landed a bit too far to the south.
