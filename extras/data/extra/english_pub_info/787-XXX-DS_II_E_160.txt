The white viper can become a serpent when it gets a chance to continue to grow but nobody sees it. There was a tiny little thicket in the heath near Underliden mountain, it was also called Pirrup thicket, and a farmhand had cut himself a switch in the thicket. Then he comes to Copenhagen in service, and he meets a man on the road, who takes this switch and looks at it. Then he asks him where he'd cut it. Well, he answered, I cut it in a place where I was allowed to cut. Then the other one asks if he couldn't be allowed to see the place where he'd cut the switch. He agreed to that, but they couldn't do it now, it was in Vendsyssel, and he was in Copenhagen. Well, he'd be given free to travel, says the man, if he could show precisely from which branch he had cut the switch. Yes, he was certain he could do that, but he wasn't sure it would fit the switch, since he'd cut a piece from the switch. That didn't matter, just as long as he could show him the branch and the tree, then they'd go on the trip for that. They went off and came to the place and he showed him the branch. Then the strange man blew into the branch and at the same time, a whole bunch of vipers came up around them. Then the farm hand got scared and would have run away, but the other one said he shouldn't be scared, he promised him that they wouldn't do anything to him. Finally, the white viper came up, and he took it, and they traveled off again.
