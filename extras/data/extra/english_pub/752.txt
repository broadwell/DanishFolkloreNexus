There was an old woman in Martofte who was called Ma Østergårds. She was very good at selling butter, but one time when she came to Kjærteminde with her butter, she had taken the wrong container (eighth), and they kept taking from it there, it couldn't be emptied. They broke it into pieces, and then there was a large toad in the bottom, that was what was making the butter. A farmhand worked in the same woman's farm, they called him Lars Rytter, and he had a disagreement with her. Then one evening, he came walking along on his way home, and came past Kristen Andersen's house, when a large cat came and jumped up on him and scratched his face. Then he says, "You aren't going to hurt me too bad, since I know, the Devil take me, that you are Ma Østergårds." Then the cat disappeared. It happened in old Lars Madsen's farm, since that was his wife and Mads Larsen's mother.
