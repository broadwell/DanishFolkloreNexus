In a farm, a dead woman walked again, even though there was only one girl who could see her, but she saw her often. The revenant always went in a room where there was a cupboard with silverware and she stood and rummaged about in it. One time the girls were baking, the girl saw the woman again and yelled to another girl who stood in the way of the woman with a pot in her hand, that she should hurry out of the way, but the girl wasn’t prepared to do that and the woman bumped into her so she dropped the pot and she got very sick. But she didn’t see anything.
