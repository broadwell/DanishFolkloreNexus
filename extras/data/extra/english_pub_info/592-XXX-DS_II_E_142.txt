Brøndsted mill has always been filled with grass snakes, and so it was one day that both of old Søren Møller's sons wanted to go out and shoot them, as they were laying there sunning themselves round about on the ground by the big alder trees. When the old man heard the shots, he comes out to them and says, "Boys, be careful! They've been here since before my time and they'll be here after, look up at the trees and hurry out of there!" And when they looked up, the trees were full of grass snakes, hanging on all the branches. They hadn't noticed that.
