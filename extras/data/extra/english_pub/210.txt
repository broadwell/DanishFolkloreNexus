Eighty years ago a man lived on Knudsholmen in Ugilt, and they called him Iver Holmen. He was both a parish bailiff and a superintendent for a military district. Then one night one hundred and twenty feet of canvas disappeared and they looked far and wide for this canvas, but it couldn't be found. Then Iver goes to this here Bragholdt hag and wants her to show it again. He gets over there and also gets to talk to her and asks her advice. Then she says: “I'll tell you sure enough where your canvas is but you can come back tomorrow, it's pretty late now.” The man didn't like this, it was a long way from Holmen to Bragholdt, and he had to go over Asted bridge north of the farm Egebjærg, it wasn't too nice to travel over it at night. But then he sees that the wall boards of the barn there at the farm are weak and a lot of them were down; so he decides to go into the barn and lie down. He lies down in some hay and packs himself in. Then during the night, two come into the barn, and one of them was the hag and then a little man. He can hear that she's good and drunk and she has a dishcloth in her hand which she smacks this little guy hard in the head with. He was supposed to tell her where the canvas was. But then he yells, “He hears! He hears!” She was so drunk that she didn't hear what the little man said and she continued to beat him so he had to tell her. It lay in a sink hole in the minister's field east of Holmen. So, as soon as they'd left the barn again, Iver Holm goes back home and finds his canvas and he was happy. But the next day, the repercussions came. A message arrived from her that he should come over, she wanted to talk to him. Then he had to pay what she wanted and he didn't get off easy before he was allowed to go home.
