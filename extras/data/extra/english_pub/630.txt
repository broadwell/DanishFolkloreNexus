My father said that just east of Vilsted school there was a mound and there were dwarves in it. It sank straight down, and then it left a water hole, called Swarris hole. The mound was also called Swarris mound. The woman at the farm also helped out when the woman in the mound gave birth. She really wanted her to help her. The mound man carried her into the mound. When they were done, the woman said: "Now you need to be careful, as soon as you come into your own foyer, you need to grab onto the door latch, otherwise he'll take you with him again." And so she grabbed on. Then he said, "It hasn't hit etc." Then he left, and he was angry.
