One time a stablehand from Åker went out into the stable and there’s a mare and it’s skittish and very ill at ease. He stands and looks at it a bit, and he decides to go up to it and feel its mane. There’s that belief about making oneself a mare’s lock. He feels about and notices something just like a darning needle, but it was so soft that he could bend it. Then he pulled it out and went back into the stable with it. Yes, it was a darning needle with an eyelet sure enough, but he could nevertheless bend it completely over itself. He put the point in through the eyelet and tosses it like that down into the dung heap. The next morning when he came out into the stable, he sees to his great surprise that the next door neighbor’s wife is lying and kicking about down in the dung heap with her legs up behind her head and couldn’t get out of there.
