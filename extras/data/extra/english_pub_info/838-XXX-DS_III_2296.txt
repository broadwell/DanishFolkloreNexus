Stjærnehøj (Star mound) is in the southwestern end of Ulfborg orchard. It's a very visibly raised mound, and one can see that a lot of people have dug in it, but the yield has only been a single stone axe. It was said, otherwise, that there is a treasure hidden in it. One time the men from the Lysbæk farms wanted to try and find it and were well underway with the work. They had gotten so far that they saw the rim of a giant kettle; but then one of them noticed that their farms were ablaze. They stumbled from the mound running as fast as they could, but soon they discovered that it was simply an illusion. The treasure had immediately disappeared however.
