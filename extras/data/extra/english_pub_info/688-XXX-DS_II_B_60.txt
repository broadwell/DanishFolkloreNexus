Nebbegård no longer stands where it used to, and the reason for that is the following: Nebbegård and Østergård both had a nisse. These two did not have good relations with each other because, to enrich their masters, they stole grain from each other. One night they wound up meeting each other, and each one had a giant cargo of stolen grain. Now they fought for a long time, but the end result was that the nisse from Nebbe had to give in and he was killed. Then the Ødsted nisse trounced all over Nebbe, so they were forced to move the farm a little ways away so the nisse wouldn’t have any power. They did that, and since then there was peace.
