An old man, Jens Ywsten (Justesen), who was somewhat down and out, lived in Skjelhusene, where Mylenbjærg is now. When he was mad at his wife, he said that she’d be rid of him sure enough, because at such and such a time the Devil was going to come and get him. He always went and swore that the Devil should take him. Then one night, his wife sat and milked, a shaggy dog came and climbed up a wagon shaft and went up and finally sat down by their chimney out on the roof. When the woman came in, her husband lay in their bed and froth was coming out of his nose and mouth. So then they thought that it was the Devil who’d come to get him, and she got so scared, the poor woman, that she ran off and got their neighbor, they called him Søren Krog. The first thing he did was to stop the clock, the Devil was supposed to get him at a precise time, and then they read and they prayed and finally the dog disappeared again. The man got better and he became so good-natured because of this that he never swore again, he’d only say: Få dig for skam (For shame).
