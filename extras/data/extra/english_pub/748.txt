Old Blicher from Spentrup had driven to a farm in Gassum once where the people could neither spin nor take care of household work without being disturbed by a ghost. It also pulled the comforters off of them at night. Therefore they asked pastor Blicher to conjure the ghost, and he promised he’d do that, but he said that they shouldn’t worry about anything before he came. His farmhand, Kristen, was supposed to drive for him, and he said to him that he couldn’t drive back until he came and hit him on the shoulder with the words: “Drive now in Jesus’s name.” The driver sat on the wagon and heard something that howled in the farm. Then something came and sat in the wagon and said: “Drive now, Kristen.” But he didn’t drive. A second time and a third time. Then the minister came and said the right words. Now while they drove home, they came past Kjellerup mill and there is a big hill there. “You’re whipping the horses so hard,” says the minister. Well, they couldn’t pull the wagon. “Take the back wheel off then.” When they got into the parsonage, the minister says again: “Be faithful to me now, little Kristen. Uncouple the horses and then go in and go to bed.” But when Kristen got into bed, he wanted to get up and see, since there was a great howling and row out there. Then it took the roof off of the barn and set it down squarely beside it. The next morning the minister said: “We could have avoided that, Kristen, if you had listened to me.”
