During the time of the plague, the ones from the farms Ajstrup, Røgind and Gamskjær drove the dead to the cemetery. One time a man had gotten a really big cargo in which there was one who wasn’t quite dead yet. When they drove near Tingvad past some woods, he gets ahold of a tree branch and raises himself out of the wagon and gets off into the woods and he continues to live there. It isn’t all open, there are still some trees over there by Tingvad. Near Halskov and Bådsgård it was once thick with woods. 
     On the east side of Kobberup cemetery there is a plague pit. It is overgrown with heather, and the place is just as high as the other.
