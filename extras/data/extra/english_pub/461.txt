A robber from Skanderborg was decapitated in Odder. The head lay in the street and was abused and, because of this, the minister took it home and put it up in his attic. The result of that, in the meanwhile, was that the parsonage became haunted, so every night at twelve, all of the doors and gates sprang open. They buried the head then; but it kept coming back. A farmhand who worked in the parsonage told that story and he had also seen the head.
