There’s a church at the bottom of Stilling lake. In still weather, you can see the walls, and there’s a large treasure down there in an ironclad chest. These people from Svolbjærg had sailed out there in two boats, and they wanted to get ahold of it, and they’d had some hooks made at the smithy which they could hook onto it with, and they also managed to get the chest right up to the gunwales of both boats and they were about to sail to shore with it. But before they get there, it looks to them like their town was on fire, and so they let the chest go and it went back down to the bottom. The church had sunk on account of a minister who was so ungodly and during a mass the church went down with him.
