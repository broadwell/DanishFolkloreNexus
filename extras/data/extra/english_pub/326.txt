Down by Skjødstrup, there are two places where there had been hidden people (mound dwellers). There were also some here on the commons. One night, several of us women walked from Bygballe, and it was so bright off to the left but it was so dark off to the right, because that’s where Bastruphøj was. When we came opposite it, there was a tall woman with green sleeves and a red blouse and a white apron and a long green skirt. I got really scared by her. People other than me have seen her too. I have also seen a fire wheel by those mounds. It was Shrovetide Monday, and I was walking with the bread basket, and it came flying toward me and continued on toward Møgelhøje.
