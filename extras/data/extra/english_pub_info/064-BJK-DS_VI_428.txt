There was a soldier who had sixty miles to go to get home, and then he goes up to a person who is driving and asked permission to ride with him. Well, he got permission and he gets up (in the wagon). Then they drove for about an hour and they get to a town. The coachman asks him if he knows that town. Well, it looked familiar but there was no reason it should because he knew he had sixty miles to go to get home and they hadn’t been driving for more than an hour. Well, it was right, he was to get off here, and now he could say that the Devil had done right by a poor soldier, but he himself had to go another sixty miles and help a poor girl have a child. The girl wanted it killed and he had to go and help her with that. But her boyfriend had told her that she shouldn’t do it until he’d had a chance to see it. Then she put the child to her right breast and it began to suck. Then he asks her if she won’t do it. No, now she couldn’t because the child had had her breast. Then the Devil cackled up on the cock’s roost and said that he wouldn’t have held her lower back if he’d thought it would go like this.
