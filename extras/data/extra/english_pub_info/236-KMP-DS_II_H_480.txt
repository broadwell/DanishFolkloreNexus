One evening a man was driving along, he’d been over at Tåbæk mill. When he passed Ødum and was headed toward Langskov, he had the impression that a large crowd was approaching. He drove a bit to the side for them, and then a funeral procession passed him, and he could vividly hear them mumbling. Then they turned in towards the church and there they disappeared.
