There were two girls from Egens who went to Bregnet church. They were from the farm called Munkens sted (the monk’s place). But when they went into the forest, robbers came after them, it was near a stream in Kalvø woods, which is still called Røverbækken (Robber stream). But they got away from them and were saved. In thanks, they built their father Egens church. He took out his book of psalms and let a page of it fly to the wind, and where it fell, that’s where the church was to be built. That’s why Egens church lies a bit outside of the town.
