In Nygård’s woods, a horseman rides on a headless horse. My father and my maternal uncle often went out hunting at night and they encountered that haunting. It crackled in the leaves and snorted just like a horse, and they couldn’t get the dog they had with them to move from the spot and so they they had to go back home again that night.
