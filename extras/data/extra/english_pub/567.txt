Up here in the parsonage there used to be a minister who was called Black Jens. He was really bad about walking in the cemetery at night, and his wife felt that this was improper. So she gets the driver to put a sheet over himself to frighten him. Then the minister yells: “Are you a human, then talk, if you are Satan, then yield!” He said this three times. The farmhand waits too long to answer and, when he looks around, he is in the ground up to his knees. It was near the end of the barn that this happened, and then he says: “It is me, Father.” “Now it’s too late, I can’t save you.” He went in and got wine and bread and gave him the last rites and then conjured him down. It’s at that place just where you turn into the parsonage.
