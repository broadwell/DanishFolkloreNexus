When you get the fat from a white viper, you become clairvoyant. A little girl could see that a cow that had just come from the bull was with calf. There was one guy who had killed a white viper so the vipers always chased him. 
     Down in Himmerland there's a cunning woman who heals with viper meat. Pastor Worm, who was the minister here, said that he once came into Rold school, and there were two small girls from a nearby farm who had been sick for a while, the one had already started school, but the other one hadn't. Then Worm asks the sister how things were with her. Well, she was sick. What advice had they taken? They ate viper meat, she said. "Why haven't you and your sister gotten better?" -- "Well she talked while she ate it."
     They got it on their sandwiches. Kr√¶ Mon here in Gudum eats vipers. He cuts the head and tail and stomach off, dries them in the sun, and then they're just as good as salted eel.
