Down here to the north there was a smith's wife and their journeyman smith who had become good friends. Then they wanted to get the smith out of the way, and they figured out an easy way that they were going to get rid of him in that the journeyman made a large nail and said that he'd drive it into the man's head. They did it too, while the smith lay sleeping. She held the nail and he hit with the hammer. The whole thing went quietly and well. Twenty years later, the same gravedigger, who had dug the smith's grave, happened to dig him up again and found his head. Then the head of the nail could be seen, it stuck out of the skull. He thinks over the affair, and realizes that the smith was buried there. So he goes to the minister and reports what he has discovered. He says, "Bring the head here,"-- the parsonage was in town right next to the church. Then the minister puts the head in his room and sends for the woman. "How long ago is it that your previous husband died?" -- "Oh, well it\s probably twenty years ago."--"Is it that long ago? Would you recognize him if you saw him?"--"Yes, I certainly could." Then the minister took the cloth off the skull and showed it to her. "Yes, that's right enough." she says. "What happened with that nail?" Well, she told him everything and they were punished, and were executed, both the woman and the journeyman.
