They couldn’t get salt here in Jutland during the old war from 1801 to 1814, and so they built some salt factories in different places where they cooked salt from seaweed. There was one of these factories near Jerup in Elling. There was a farmhand who was supposed to take care of the works and then there was a mermaid who wanted to come ashore and warm herself by this kettle. She came every day for a quite a while. Finally, he gets angry and he takes a pitcher of this salt brine and throws it at her, and so she darts out into the water and screams, “Pilvakker, Pilvakker, Skriven has been scalded.” Then the merman came ashore, and the water roiled about him and he was so angry, just as if it were a thunder storm, and he tore the salt works apart, so it was completely destroyed and if the farmhand had been there he would have probably been killed too; but he’d fled. The salt works didn’t start up again because people in Jerup had become scared. My father saw those works many times, and pieces of it lay there where it had been when he went to the minister.
