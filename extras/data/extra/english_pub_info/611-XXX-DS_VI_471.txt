In an inn in Sønderjylland, some farmhands sat around playing cards and they were swearing tremendously. Just as they were sitting there enjoying themselves, a strange man comes in and he winds up playing with them; but he played so that he beat them every time. In the middle of a hand, one of the farmhands drops an ace of clubs on the floor but when they got the candle to look for it, they saw that the strange man had a horse's hoof. Now they could pretty much see who it was that they were dealing with and so they secretly sent the girl off to get the minister, but continued to play just like there was nothing wrong. A little later the minister came in through the door with the bible under his arm and said, “Good evening everybody except for one!” Then the strange man asked who it was and the minister said: “It’s you, you wretch!” The stranger began to beg that he had to go now, if he couldn’t be allowed to leave up through the chimney. “No” says the minister, “That’s way too big a place for you to go through.” And then he cut a little hole in the window putty near the glass and said that now he had to go out that way. The Devil, because that’s who it was, turned into smoke and traveled out through the hole, but then there was such a stink after he left, that they couldn’t bare to stay in the room. After that time the farmhands stopped playing cards and swearing, and the inn got the name, “The Ace of Clubs Inn”.
