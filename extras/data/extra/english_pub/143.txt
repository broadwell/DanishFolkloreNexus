A man in Torslev, Poul Knagholt, kept himself occupied with curing things that were bewitched. He had a drag (a carcass that was dragged from one place to another) and he wanted to use it to shoot foxes. As he was standing watching it, a fox came and started to gnaw on the carcass. He shoots, but it runs away. He goes into the house to reload while the carcass lay there behind the barn. There was some brushwood (alder, oak and all sorts of trees and bushes) there close to the farm. The fox had run down into that while the man was inside. When he comes out again, the fox is gnawing again. He shoots another time, but it was the same story, it didn’t get hurt. Then he’s going to load a third time and he goes in to his wife and says, “Now I’ve shot a second time in vain, but I won’t a third time.” Then he took a silver button and loaded it with that and shot. But while he was inside loading, there was a huge ruckus in the cow barn. When he came out, the fox was gnawing again. Now when he shoots, it screams and it is wounded. Then he jumps out of the hatch and he gets so close to it he can see that it has turned into a hag with a red skirt over her, and her one thigh had been shot to pieces. The next morning her son comes and asks the man to give him a remedy for the woman, she’d broken her thigh and the cure was the marrow of the right leg of the drag. But the man answered, “If you want it, then you can take it yourself.” But they couldn’t take the marrow and she wound up staying in bed, and she lay there for an entire year before she died. I knew the son who went to get the remedy. When the man had shot the hag and gone back into the cow barn to see what had happened, he found that two of his calves lay there dead, their necks had been wrung, and she’d been in to do that after he’d shot the second time. That hag was from Skjern in Torslev parish.
